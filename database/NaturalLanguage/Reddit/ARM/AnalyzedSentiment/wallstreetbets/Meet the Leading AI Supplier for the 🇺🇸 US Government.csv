,"My deep dive on Booz Allen Hamilton’s AI dominance and what it means for traders I'm sharing my research so YOU can make a better decision. I know many members prefer to be told what to buy, but this is an essay, not a BanBet. My current BanBet record is 31-20, which is so-so. But honestly, you should still learn how to trade, not how to shadow. So why should you read this? That's something you have to decide. Read the title. Only you can decide whether it makes sense to find out more about this company, or not. This is the only image I can post here. 🙁 ❗️ TL;DR: Look here, this essay’s got more words than a politician’s promise, and it doesn't even spoon-feeds you a play. Preposterous! If you’re itching to block me, here’s your guide. Now, if the sheer volume of words is giving you the vapors, I don’t blame you. Just look at this behemoth of text. By golly! Let’s face it: you don’t really want to be here, and you’re likely not my audience (folks who actually enjoy reading and/or appreciate knowledge). So, I’d just as soon see you off. Sure, you could go outside and indulge in memes, but I wager you’ve got a primal need to scroll down and leave a gripe about how absurd it is to expect anyone to wade through this verbosity. Well, go ahead. Vent away. Hello. Welcome. You should already know that in today's financial markets, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as the golden prodigy, with investors flocking like bees to honey, eagerly snapping up stocks from those trailblazing companies leading the AI revolution. Amidst this fervor, one company stands as the top purveyor of AI services to the U.S. government. Yet, it remains unknown to the general populace. This essay delves into why Booz Allen Hamilton has earned this position, the significant impact of its AI initiatives, and what this means for traders keen to ride the AI boom. Interested? Keep reading, then. ⚠️ WARNING: I originally wrote this research before Booz Allen Hamilton’s fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 results. Fiscal year, not a calendar year. And I did share my findings with other traders on time. If you are reading this now, that event is already in the past. However, the research is still valid, so I’m posting it here. ⚠️ DISCLAIMER: In their diaphanous wisdom, Reddit/Mods have decreed that posts be limited to a single attachment, which I’ve already used. This essay is adorned with several images to enhance its appeal and, more crucially, includes numerous charts, which I am regrettably unable to include here. If you wish to peruse the full essay with all its illustrative charts, here’s the link. You can continue reading it here on WSB, but be forewarned—you’ll miss out on the visual aids that bring the data to life. The choice, dear reader, is yours. Well now, picture this: The clock has just struck midnight, and today — Friday, May 24, 2024 — has only begun to stretch its legs. I literally just mentioned that I originally wrote this research before Booz Allen Hamilton’s fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 results. Just a few hours ago, I went and bought myself a trunk full of Booz Allen Hamilton shares. And wouldn’t you know it, in just a handful of hours, that very company is set to unveil their earnings report, promising a significant move in the stock, one way or another. Again, I wrote this last week before the earnings. I leaped into this play guided by my trader’s intuition. Now, as I burn the midnight oil, I’m digging into the logic and facts behind that decision. I figured, heck, why not pen an essay about the things I uncover along the way? the number one provider of artificial intelligence (AI) services to the U.S. government. A bit of history Booz Allen Hamilton is no hip upstart. Nope. This institution was founded way back in 1914 by one Edwin G. Booz in the bustling city of Chicago, offering management consulting services before it was even fashionable. During the 1940s, it played a pivotal role in World War II, aiding the U.S. military in improving efficiency and logistics. A decade later, the firm found a niche working with U.S. defense contracts, cementing its reputation as a trusted advisor to Uncle Sam. So why focus on a company named like a law firm? Well, according to GovWin from Deltek — a leading market intelligence organization — Booz Allen is the number one provider of artificial intelligence (AI) services to the U.S. government. And unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’d know that the market currently embraces anything related to artificial intelligence with open arms and a hearty cheer. AI is the belle of the ball. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. For perspective, exactly one year ago (May 24, 2023), NVIDIA had a market capitalization of $760.2 billion. Today, she’s valued at $2.55 trillion. Why? It’s largely due to the insatiably high demand for its AI chips, which are essential for powering advanced AI applications. A reliable uptrend Booz Allen Hamilton boasts a legacy spanning over a century — they consider it 110 years young — but it wasn’t until 2010 that it opened its doors to public investors, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BAH. And if we take a gander at the company’s story as told by its yearly chart, from a humble low of $11.85 in 2012, Booz Allen has steadily climbed the ladder of success, closing today — or yesterday — at $156.83. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Historical yearly performance of Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) stock) here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. That’s a 1,224% ascent, with only a single slightly red year in between, marring the record in 2021. That’s quite the tale of endurance and growth, wouldn’t you say? Aren’t we late to the party, though? Well, Booz Allen Hamilton’s current market capitalization stands at a tidy $20 billion. It’s nothing to scoff at, mind you, but to put things in perspective, this ranks Booz Allen as the 955th most valuable company. There’s still plenty of rungs left to climb on the ladder and ample room for growth down the road. A significant catalyst I’m sharing a monthly chart. Generally speaking, BAH was meandering sideways for nearly three years. That is, until a year ago, on May 26, 2023, to be precise. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Monthly performance of Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) stock. The price level illustrates a resistance/support level between August 2020 and May 2023.) here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. Following that earnings report, the stock kicked up her heels and went on a 38% run over the next two months. Also, aside from better-than-expected earnings, Booz Allen Hamilton was awarded a $919 million Engineering, Development, Integration, and Technology-based Solutions (EDITS) contract. The contract supports the “Soldier as a System” concept, enhancing warfighter capabilities across multiple Department of Defense (DoD) agencies. The EDITS program promotes collaboration across service boundaries and aims to modernize and equip military tactical units, improving lethality, survivability, and situational awareness. Look at the competition Hold your horses. It’s not just one contract or one project propelling Booz Allen Hamilton skyward. The tide of AI is lifting all boats, so it’s not just one company sailing full steam ahead. Granted, Booz Allen offers a smorgasbord of services, thus facing several competitors in various fields. However, if we narrow our focus to the AI sector, some of the most direct competitors are: Leidos Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: LDOS) Leidos provides AI and machine learning solutions to various U.S. government agencies, including the Department of Defense (DoD). Their AI capabilities are integrated into solutions for cybersecurity, data analysis, and operational efficiency in defense and intelligence operations. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Daily performance of Leidos Holdings (LDOS) stock.

As you can see, when earnings roll around, these companies tend to pop and set off on a run northward, much like a hound hot on the trail. Each earnings report can become a potential catalyst, sparking a surge in investor enthusiasm and sending stock prices climbing. That’s what I’m playing. What I played. ----- Other high-profile projects Booz Allen Hamilton is involved in several high-profile projects that leverage AI. Some notable projects include: Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) Booz Allen supports the U.S. Department of Defense’s CJADC2 initiative alongside L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: LHX), which aims to integrate sensors, data, and weapon systems across all military domains — land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace — using AI and machine learning to enhance situational awareness and decision-making capabilities. Project Maven Booz Allen has been a key contractor in Project Maven, an AI program initiated by the Department of Defense, which among other things, aims to analyze video footage from drones using machine learning algorithms to identify objects and patterns, significantly improving intelligence and surveillance operations. Project Linchpin It is the U.S. Army’s first program of record providing an artificial intelligence operations pipeline. It is currently just a $2 million contract to support research and development, but it is anticipated to be followed by subsequent juicier contracts. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. Satellites Booz Allen also made a strategic investment in Albedo, the first company to operate satellites in very low Earth orbit (VLEO), which enables them to offer ultra-high resolution commercial imagery from space. Let’s take a moment to chill because it’s not all black ops and military projects. U.S. Department of Energy On March 12, 2024, Booz Allen Hamilton announced it was awarded a ten-year $550 million contract from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) to support the advancement of high-potential, high-impact, early-stage technologies that generate, store, and use energy in entirely new ways to reduce U.S. emissions, improve energy efficiency, and increase the resiliency and reliability of the U.S. power grid. To give you an idea, ARPA-E is tasked with identifying, shepherding, and accelerating “…the stuff that sounds crazy until it changes the world.” U.S. Environmental Protection Agency On May 8, 2024, the company announced it was awarded a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) to support the agency’s modernization efforts and its mission to protect human health and the environment. Booz Allen won one of four positions on the seven-year Scientific Modeling, Application, Visualization, Computational Science, Software, and Statistical Support (SMAVCS4) BPA, which has a ceiling of $431 million. And many more Booz Allen has nearly 200 active AI projects across defense, national security, and civil missions — including three of the largest AI contracts within the Department of Defense. Understandably, many of them are top secret. 🤐 Late last year, an analyst noted that 2,200 BAH employees are considered ‘AI staff,’ with a staggering 80% holding government security clearances. The company’s AI capabilities are not just extensive but also deeply integrated into sensitive areas of national security. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. For those curious souls wanting to delve deeper, check out Booz Allen Hamilton’s Leading AI for the Federal Government portal. If your stars align, you might even consider applying for a job since they’re growing and looking to fill a multitude of positions. What analysts are saying In a February research report, William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma mentioned that the outbreak of multiple wars and the artificial intelligence boom “have led to an inflection in government tech hiring and bookings that we feel has some serious legs.” And also, that Booz Allen “remains the government’s go-to source to modernize the military and prepare for conflicts.” In fact, the company “has more backlog than it can handle as government spending has surged on Pacific tensions and AI prototyping.” Finally, this week (May 21, 2024), Stifel raised its price target for BAH to $170 from $155 (from the chart above that you can't see, BAH was $156.83), keeping a buy rating since “AI, cyber and IT modernization remain in focus for the government.” Besides, there have been recently approved federal budget and supplemental spending packages. According to data from William Blair, the analyst sentiment towards Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) is overwhelmingly positive. Not a single soul is suggesting to sell, which paints a promising picture for our tale. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image with the current rating distribution. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. This table could be important to see. Their aiSSEMBLE solution Just recently — on April 30, 2024 — Booz Allen Hamilton announced the launch of aiSSEMBLE Baseline, a first-of-its-kind, open-source solution built to simplify the engineering and deployment of AI systems. Booz Allen Hamilton boasts that aiSSEMBLE is the core tool cementing its status as the leading AI provider to the U.S. federal government. If that’s the case, it suggests that this new foundational code, complete with open-source documentation and free for use by government, academic, nonprofit, and commercial entities, could further extend Booz Allen’s lead. It can also help them with talent acquisition. By opening the doors to aiSSEMBLE, Booz Allen is inviting a wave of innovation from all corners — government agencies, universities, nonprofits, and private firms — because some bright sparks out there will undoubtedly create remarkable innovations using aiSSEMBLE, catching Booz Allen’s eye in the process. There’s one kink, though… Booz Allen Hamilton’s own top brass sold shares on May 21, 2024. Those actions were filed with the SEC a day before BHA was scheduled to report earnings. There are eight Form-4s. For those not in the know, a Form-4 is a statement of changes in beneficial ownership of securities by company insiders. But wait a second. Let’s dig deeper. All the Form-4s state they first acquired shares through the vesting of performance-based restricted stock units (RSUs). These RSUs are a form of compensation granted to employees, becoming vested and thereby exercisable or transferable based on achieving specific performance criteria over a set period. In other words, they hit a target — they accomplish a goal — and they’re rewarded with stock. The shares they sold are just a part of the shares acquired. For instance, the CEO — Horacio Rozanski — received 71,575 shares, and he decided to sell 34,571. The EVP & Chief Operating Officer Kristine Anderson acquired 7,544 shares and sold 3,644. Not a single one of them decided to sell the farm and run away. Therefore, they might have sold a portion to cover taxes or diversify their portfolios. This is a common practice and doesn’t necessarily reflect a lack of confidence in the company’s future. Besides, the number of shares sold is minimal compared to the total number they still hold. I told you the CEO sold 34,571 shares, but he is still holding 579,025 more. Kristine sold 3,644, but she still has 72,761. In the end, it is not a red flag. But it was a kink I didn’t appreciate, considering they still decided to sell before earnings. Then again, it’s quite plausible that Booz Allen Hamilton’s top brass might be governed by internal clauses dictating when they can sell their vested shares. After all, many companies have strict trading windows and blackout periods to prevent any appearance of insider trading or conflict of interest. Nonetheless, this was one of the two reasons why I only bought a trunk instead of backing up a Freightliner to load up with shares. How my gambit played out Honestly, there's no point in narrating the play on Reddit since I can't add the entry, premarket charts, profit, or any attachments. So... if you care about how I played this, the link is here. One more insight I learned Booz Allen Hamilton and its helmsman, Horacio Rozanski, aren’t clamoring atop the AI hype train, hollering for investors to crown them the new AI darling everyone should own. Make no mistake, they’re an AI powerhouse. It’s just that they’re not focused on selling the sizzle. In the current world, where companies blare out press releases at the faintest whiff of anything AI-related to entice investors, Booz Allen Hamilton — armed with bona fide credentials — opts to toil diligently away from the limelight. Perhaps it’s by design, though. Considering this is a company that lists its fiscal 2024 revenue with most projects cloaked in secrecy. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here with all their classified contracts. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. So what happens now? I’ve already tipped my hand and no longer hold any BAH shares. My play has come and gone. Considering today's pullback, I bought a small number of September and December calls. Now, after reading this essay, could someone consider investing in Booz Allen Hamilton? Maybe. AI is set to grow, the U.S. government is bound to expand its AI use, and this company is already well-positioned to secure more projects. So, why am I not invested in BAH? Because I’m neither an investor nor a position trader. I’m a short-term swing trader. I played this earnings catalyst, made some profit, and then walked away. Granted, after this deep dive, I’ll keep an eye on BAH and might tag along if she sets up for a northward run. But I know my timeframe. I know my trading style and my limitations. Likewise, it’s up to you to know your trading style and decide what to do with this information. Keep in mind, BAH experienced some volatility selling, and the implied volatility dipped post-earnings and guidance. Probably because some who positioned ahead of earnings were expecting a bigger leap. It’s logical to assume some will take their profits (as we saw today), so don't jump blindly. On the flip side, these earnings mostly flew under the radar. Booz Allen Hamilton remains an AI colossus that most retail traders haven’t even heard of. Besides, do you know how many will actually read this and understand the information? At any rate, now you know what I know. Have a great day.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,0.999,NEGATIVE

By opening the doors to aiSSEMBLE, Booz Allen is inviting a wave of innovation from all corners — government agencies, universities, nonprofits, and private firms — because some bright sparks out there will undoubtedly create remarkable innovations using aiSSEMBLE, catching Booz Allen’s eye in the process. There’s one kink, though… Booz Allen Hamilton’s own top brass sold shares on May 21, 2024. Those actions were filed with the SEC a day before BHA was scheduled to report earnings. There are eight Form-4s. For those not in the know, a Form-4 is a statement of changes in beneficial ownership of securities by company insiders. But wait a second. Let’s dig deeper. All the Form-4s state they first acquired shares through the vesting of performance-based restricted stock units (RSUs). These RSUs are a form of compensation granted to employees, becoming vested and thereby exercisable or transferable based on achieving specific performance criteria over a set period. In other words, they hit a target — they accomplish a goal — and they’re rewarded with stock. The shares they sold are just a part of the shares acquired. For instance, the CEO — Horacio Rozanski — received 71,575 shares, and he decided to sell 34,571. The EVP & Chief Operating Officer Kristine Anderson acquired 7,544 shares and sold 3,644. Not a single one of them decided to sell the farm and run away. Therefore, they might have sold a portion to cover taxes or diversify their portfolios. This is a common practice and doesn’t necessarily reflect a lack of confidence in the company’s future. Besides, the number of shares sold is minimal compared to the total number they still hold. I told you the CEO sold 34,571 shares, but he is still holding 579,025 more. Kristine sold 3,644, but she still has 72,761. In the end, it is not a red flag. But it was a kink I didn’t appreciate, considering they still decided to sell before earnings. Then again, it’s quite plausible that Booz Allen Hamilton’s top brass might be governed by internal clauses dictating when they can sell their vested shares. After all, many companies have strict trading windows and blackout periods to prevent any appearance of insider trading or conflict of interest. Nonetheless, this was one of the two reasons why I only bought a trunk instead of backing up a Freightliner to load up with shares. How my gambit played out Honestly, there's no point in narrating the play on Reddit since I can't add the entry, premarket charts, profit, or any attachments. So... if you care about how I played this, the link is here. One more insight I learned Booz Allen Hamilton and its helmsman, Horacio Rozanski, aren’t clamoring atop the AI hype train, hollering for investors to crown them the new AI darling everyone should own. Make no mistake, they’re an AI powerhouse. It’s just that they’re not focused on selling the sizzle. In the current world, where companies blare out press releases at the faintest whiff of anything AI-related to entice investors, Booz Allen Hamilton — armed with bona fide credentials — opts to toil diligently away from the limelight. Perhaps it’s by design, though. Considering this is a company that lists its fiscal 2024 revenue with most projects cloaked in secrecy. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here with all their classified contracts. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. So what happens now? I’ve already tipped my hand and no longer hold any BAH shares. My play has come and gone. Considering today's pullback, I bought a small number of September and December calls. Now, after reading this essay, could someone consider investing in Booz Allen Hamilton? Maybe. AI is set to grow, the U.S. government is bound to expand its AI use, and this company is already well-positioned to secure more projects. So, why am I not invested in BAH? Because I’m neither an investor nor a position trader. I’m a short-term swing trader. I played this earnings catalyst, made some profit, and then walked away. Granted, after this deep dive, I’ll keep an eye on BAH and might tag along if she sets up for a northward run. But I know my timeframe. I know my trading style and my limitations. Likewise, it’s up to you to know your trading style and decide what to do with this information. Keep in mind, BAH experienced some volatility selling, and the implied volatility dipped post-earnings and guidance. Probably because some who positioned ahead of earnings were expecting a bigger leap. It’s logical to assume some will take their profits (as we saw today), so don't jump blindly. On the flip side, these earnings mostly flew under the radar. Booz Allen Hamilton remains an AI colossus that most retail traders haven’t even heard of. Besides, do you know how many will actually read this and understand the information? At any rate, now you know what I know. Have a great day.","Our AI tracks our most intelligent users.

,"My deep dive on Booz Allen Hamilton’s AI dominance and what it means for traders I'm sharing my research so YOU can make a better decision. I know many members prefer to be told what to buy, but this is an essay, not a BanBet. My current BanBet record is 31-20, which is so-so. But honestly, you should still learn how to trade, not how to shadow. So why should you read this? That's something you have to decide. Read the title. Only you can decide whether it makes sense to find out more about this company, or not. This is the only image I can post here. 🙁 ❗️ TL;DR: Look here, this essay’s got more words than a politician’s promise, and it doesn't even spoon-feeds you a play. Preposterous! If you’re itching to block me, here’s your guide. Now, if the sheer volume of words is giving you the vapors, I don’t blame you. Just look at this behemoth of text. By golly! Let’s face it: you don’t really want to be here, and you’re likely not my audience (folks who actually enjoy reading and/or appreciate knowledge). So, I’d just as soon see you off. Sure, you could go outside and indulge in memes, but I wager you’ve got a primal need to scroll down and leave a gripe about how absurd it is to expect anyone to wade through this verbosity. Well, go ahead. Vent away. Hello. Welcome. You should already know that in today's financial markets, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as the golden prodigy, with investors flocking like bees to honey, eagerly snapping up stocks from those trailblazing companies leading the AI revolution. Amidst this fervor, one company stands as the top purveyor of AI services to the U.S. government. Yet, it remains unknown to the general populace. This essay delves into why Booz Allen Hamilton has earned this position, the significant impact of its AI initiatives, and what this means for traders keen to ride the AI boom. Interested? Keep reading, then. ⚠️ WARNING: I originally wrote this research before Booz Allen Hamilton’s fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 results. Fiscal year, not a calendar year. And I did share my findings with other traders on time. If you are reading this now, that event is already in the past. However, the research is still valid, so I’m posting it here. ⚠️ DISCLAIMER: In their diaphanous wisdom, Reddit/Mods have decreed that posts be limited to a single attachment, which I’ve already used. This essay is adorned with several images to enhance its appeal and, more crucially, includes numerous charts, which I am regrettably unable to include here. If you wish to peruse the full essay with all its illustrative charts, here’s the link. You can continue reading it here on WSB, but be forewarned—you’ll miss out on the visual aids that bring the data to life. The choice, dear reader, is yours. Well now, picture this: The clock has just struck midnight, and today — Friday, May 24, 2024 — has only begun to stretch its legs. I literally just mentioned that I originally wrote this research before Booz Allen Hamilton’s fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 results. Just a few hours ago, I went and bought myself a trunk full of Booz Allen Hamilton shares. And wouldn’t you know it, in just a handful of hours, that very company is set to unveil their earnings report, promising a significant move in the stock, one way or another. Again, I wrote this last week before the earnings. I leaped into this play guided by my trader’s intuition. Now, as I burn the midnight oil, I’m digging into the logic and facts behind that decision. I figured, heck, why not pen an essay about the things I uncover along the way? the number one provider of artificial intelligence (AI) services to the U.S. government. A bit of history Booz Allen Hamilton is no hip upstart. Nope. This institution was founded way back in 1914 by one Edwin G. Booz in the bustling city of Chicago, offering management consulting services before it was even fashionable. During the 1940s, it played a pivotal role in World War II, aiding the U.S. military in improving efficiency and logistics. A decade later, the firm found a niche working with U.S. defense contracts, cementing its reputation as a trusted advisor to Uncle Sam. So why focus on a company named like a law firm? Well, according to GovWin from Deltek — a leading market intelligence organization — Booz Allen is the number one provider of artificial intelligence (AI) services to the U.S. government. And unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’d know that the market currently embraces anything related to artificial intelligence with open arms and a hearty cheer. AI is the belle of the ball. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. For perspective, exactly one year ago (May 24, 2023), NVIDIA had a market capitalization of $760.2 billion. Today, she’s valued at $2.55 trillion. Why? It’s largely due to the insatiably high demand for its AI chips, which are essential for powering advanced AI applications. A reliable uptrend Booz Allen Hamilton boasts a legacy spanning over a century — they consider it 110 years young — but it wasn’t until 2010 that it opened its doors to public investors, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BAH. And if we take a gander at the company’s story as told by its yearly chart, from a humble low of $11.85 in 2012, Booz Allen has steadily climbed the ladder of success, closing today — or yesterday — at $156.83. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Historical yearly performance of Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) stock) here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. That’s a 1,224% ascent, with only a single slightly red year in between, marring the record in 2021. That’s quite the tale of endurance and growth, wouldn’t you say? Aren’t we late to the party, though? Well, Booz Allen Hamilton’s current market capitalization stands at a tidy $20 billion. It’s nothing to scoff at, mind you, but to put things in perspective, this ranks Booz Allen as the 955th most valuable company. There’s still plenty of rungs left to climb on the ladder and ample room for growth down the road. A significant catalyst I’m sharing a monthly chart. Generally speaking, BAH was meandering sideways for nearly three years. That is, until a year ago, on May 26, 2023, to be precise. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Monthly performance of Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) stock. The price level illustrates a resistance/support level between August 2020 and May 2023.) here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. Following that earnings report, the stock kicked up her heels and went on a 38% run over the next two months. Also, aside from better-than-expected earnings, Booz Allen Hamilton was awarded a $919 million Engineering, Development, Integration, and Technology-based Solutions (EDITS) contract. The contract supports the “Soldier as a System” concept, enhancing warfighter capabilities across multiple Department of Defense (DoD) agencies. The EDITS program promotes collaboration across service boundaries and aims to modernize and equip military tactical units, improving lethality, survivability, and situational awareness. Look at the competition Hold your horses. It’s not just one contract or one project propelling Booz Allen Hamilton skyward. The tide of AI is lifting all boats, so it’s not just one company sailing full steam ahead. Granted, Booz Allen offers a smorgasbord of services, thus facing several competitors in various fields. However, if we narrow our focus to the AI sector, some of the most direct competitors are: Leidos Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: LDOS) Leidos provides AI and machine learning solutions to various U.S. government agencies, including the Department of Defense (DoD). Their AI capabilities are integrated into solutions for cybersecurity, data analysis, and operational efficiency in defense and intelligence operations. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Daily performance of Leidos Holdings (LDOS) stock.

It showcases a bullish catalyst after the most recent earnings.) here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. As you can see, when earnings roll around, these companies tend to pop and set off on a run northward, much like a hound hot on the trail. Each earnings report can become a potential catalyst, sparking a surge in investor enthusiasm and sending stock prices climbing. That’s what I’m playing. What I played. ----- Other high-profile projects Booz Allen Hamilton is involved in several high-profile projects that leverage AI. Some notable projects include: Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) Booz Allen supports the U.S. Department of Defense’s CJADC2 initiative alongside L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: LHX), which aims to integrate sensors, data, and weapon systems across all military domains — land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace — using AI and machine learning to enhance situational awareness and decision-making capabilities. Project Maven Booz Allen has been a key contractor in Project Maven, an AI program initiated by the Department of Defense, which among other things, aims to analyze video footage from drones using machine learning algorithms to identify objects and patterns, significantly improving intelligence and surveillance operations. Project Linchpin It is the U.S. Army’s first program of record providing an artificial intelligence operations pipeline. It is currently just a $2 million contract to support research and development, but it is anticipated to be followed by subsequent juicier contracts. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. Satellites Booz Allen also made a strategic investment in Albedo, the first company to operate satellites in very low Earth orbit (VLEO), which enables them to offer ultra-high resolution commercial imagery from space. Let’s take a moment to chill because it’s not all black ops and military projects. U.S. Department of Energy On March 12, 2024, Booz Allen Hamilton announced it was awarded a ten-year $550 million contract from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) to support the advancement of high-potential, high-impact, early-stage technologies that generate, store, and use energy in entirely new ways to reduce U.S. emissions, improve energy efficiency, and increase the resiliency and reliability of the U.S. power grid. To give you an idea, ARPA-E is tasked with identifying, shepherding, and accelerating “…the stuff that sounds crazy until it changes the world.” U.S. Environmental Protection Agency On May 8, 2024, the company announced it was awarded a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) to support the agency’s modernization efforts and its mission to protect human health and the environment. Booz Allen won one of four positions on the seven-year Scientific Modeling, Application, Visualization, Computational Science, Software, and Statistical Support (SMAVCS4) BPA, which has a ceiling of $431 million. And many more Booz Allen has nearly 200 active AI projects across defense, national security, and civil missions — including three of the largest AI contracts within the Department of Defense. Understandably, many of them are top secret. 🤐 Late last year, an analyst noted that 2,200 BAH employees are considered ‘AI staff,’ with a staggering 80% holding government security clearances. The company’s AI capabilities are not just extensive but also deeply integrated into sensitive areas of national security. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here.

If your stars align, you might even consider applying for a job since they’re growing and looking to fill a multitude of positions. What analysts are saying In a February research report, William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma mentioned that the outbreak of multiple wars and the artificial intelligence boom “have led to an inflection in government tech hiring and bookings that we feel has some serious legs.” And also, that Booz Allen “remains the government’s go-to source to modernize the military and prepare for conflicts.” In fact, the company “has more backlog than it can handle as government spending has surged on Pacific tensions and AI prototyping.” Finally, this week (May 21, 2024), Stifel raised its price target for BAH to $170 from $155 (from the chart above that you can't see, BAH was $156.83), keeping a buy rating since “AI, cyber and IT modernization remain in focus for the government.” Besides, there have been recently approved federal budget and supplemental spending packages. According to data from William Blair, the analyst sentiment towards Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) is overwhelmingly positive. Not a single soul is suggesting to sell, which paints a promising picture for our tale. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image with the current rating distribution.

Their aiSSEMBLE solution Just recently — on April 30, 2024 — Booz Allen Hamilton announced the launch of aiSSEMBLE Baseline, a first-of-its-kind, open-source solution built to simplify the engineering and deployment of AI systems. Booz Allen Hamilton boasts that aiSSEMBLE is the core tool cementing its status as the leading AI provider to the U.S. federal government. If that’s the case, it suggests that this new foundational code, complete with open-source documentation and free for use by government, academic, nonprofit, and commercial entities, could further extend Booz Allen’s lead.

Each earnings report can become a potential catalyst, sparking a surge in investor enthusiasm and sending stock prices climbing. That’s what I’m playing. What I played. ----- Other high-profile projects Booz Allen Hamilton is involved in several high-profile projects that leverage AI. Some notable projects include: Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) Booz Allen supports the U.S. Department of Defense’s CJADC2 initiative alongside L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: LHX), which aims to integrate sensors, data, and weapon systems across all military domains — land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace — using AI and machine learning to enhance situational awareness and decision-making capabilities. Project Maven Booz Allen has been a key contractor in Project Maven, an AI program initiated by the Department of Defense, which among other things, aims to analyze video footage from drones using machine learning algorithms to identify objects and patterns, significantly improving intelligence and surveillance operations. Project Linchpin It is the U.S. Army’s first program of record providing an artificial intelligence operations pipeline. It is currently just a $2 million contract to support research and development, but it is anticipated to be followed by subsequent juicier contracts. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. Satellites Booz Allen also made a strategic investment in Albedo, the first company to operate satellites in very low Earth orbit (VLEO), which enables them to offer ultra-high resolution commercial imagery from space. Let’s take a moment to chill because it’s not all black ops and military projects. U.S. Department of Energy On March 12, 2024, Booz Allen Hamilton announced it was awarded a ten-year $550 million contract from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) to support the advancement of high-potential, high-impact, early-stage technologies that generate, store, and use energy in entirely new ways to reduce U.S. emissions, improve energy efficiency, and increase the resiliency and reliability of the U.S. power grid. To give you an idea, ARPA-E is tasked with identifying, shepherding, and accelerating “…the stuff that sounds crazy until it changes the world.” U.S. Environmental Protection Agency On May 8, 2024, the company announced it was awarded a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) to support the agency’s modernization efforts and its mission to protect human health and the environment. Booz Allen won one of four positions on the seven-year Scientific Modeling, Application, Visualization, Computational Science, Software, and Statistical Support (SMAVCS4) BPA, which has a ceiling of $431 million. And many more Booz Allen has nearly 200 active AI projects across defense, national security, and civil missions — including three of the largest AI contracts within the Department of Defense. Understandably, many of them are top secret. 🤐 Late last year, an analyst noted that 2,200 BAH employees are considered ‘AI staff,’ with a staggering 80% holding government security clearances. The company’s AI capabilities are not just extensive but also deeply integrated into sensitive areas of national security. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. For those curious souls wanting to delve deeper, check out Booz Allen Hamilton’s Leading AI for the Federal Government portal. If your stars align, you might even consider applying for a job since they’re growing and looking to fill a multitude of positions. What analysts are saying In a February research report, William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma mentioned that the outbreak of multiple wars and the artificial intelligence boom “have led to an inflection in government tech hiring and bookings that we feel has some serious legs.” And also, that Booz Allen “remains the government’s go-to source to modernize the military and prepare for conflicts.” In fact, the company “has more backlog than it can handle as government spending has surged on Pacific tensions and AI prototyping.” Finally, this week (May 21, 2024), Stifel raised its price target for BAH to $170 from $155 (from the chart above that you can't see, BAH was $156.83), keeping a buy rating since “AI, cyber and IT modernization remain in focus for the government.” Besides, there have been recently approved federal budget and supplemental spending packages. According to data from William Blair, the analyst sentiment towards Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) is overwhelmingly positive. Not a single soul is suggesting to sell, which paints a promising picture for our tale. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image with the current rating distribution. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. This table could be important to see. Their aiSSEMBLE solution Just recently — on April 30, 2024 — Booz Allen Hamilton announced the launch of aiSSEMBLE Baseline, a first-of-its-kind, open-source solution built to simplify the engineering and deployment of AI systems. Booz Allen Hamilton boasts that aiSSEMBLE is the core tool cementing its status as the leading AI provider to the U.S. federal government. If that’s the case, it suggests that this new foundational code, complete with open-source documentation and free for use by government, academic, nonprofit, and commercial entities, could further extend Booz Allen’s lead. It can also help them with talent acquisition. By opening the doors to aiSSEMBLE, Booz Allen is inviting a wave of innovation from all corners — government agencies, universities, nonprofits, and private firms — because some bright sparks out there will undoubtedly create remarkable innovations using aiSSEMBLE, catching Booz Allen’s eye in the process. There’s one kink, though… Booz Allen Hamilton’s own top brass sold shares on May 21, 2024. Those actions were filed with the SEC a day before BHA was scheduled to report earnings. There are eight Form-4s. For those not in the know, a Form-4 is a statement of changes in beneficial ownership of securities by company insiders. But wait a second. Let’s dig deeper. All the Form-4s state they first acquired shares through the vesting of performance-based restricted stock units (RSUs). These RSUs are a form of compensation granted to employees, becoming vested and thereby exercisable or transferable based on achieving specific performance criteria over a set period. In other words, they hit a target — they accomplish a goal — and they’re rewarded with stock. The shares they sold are just a part of the shares acquired. For instance, the CEO — Horacio Rozanski — received 71,575 shares, and he decided to sell 34,571. The EVP & Chief Operating Officer Kristine Anderson acquired 7,544 shares and sold 3,644. Not a single one of them decided to sell the farm and run away. Therefore, they might have sold a portion to cover taxes or diversify their portfolios. This is a common practice and doesn’t necessarily reflect a lack of confidence in the company’s future. Besides, the number of shares sold is minimal compared to the total number they still hold. I told you the CEO sold 34,571 shares, but he is still holding 579,025 more. Kristine sold 3,644, but she still has 72,761. In the end, it is not a red flag. But it was a kink I didn’t appreciate, considering they still decided to sell before earnings. Then again, it’s quite plausible that Booz Allen Hamilton’s top brass might be governed by internal clauses dictating when they can sell their vested shares. After all, many companies have strict trading windows and blackout periods to prevent any appearance of insider trading or conflict of interest. Nonetheless, this was one of the two reasons why I only bought a trunk instead of backing up a Freightliner to load up with shares. How my gambit played out Honestly, there's no point in narrating the play on Reddit since I can't add the entry, premarket charts, profit, or any attachments. So... if you care about how I played this, the link is here. One more insight I learned Booz Allen Hamilton and its helmsman, Horacio Rozanski, aren’t clamoring atop the AI hype train, hollering for investors to crown them the new AI darling everyone should own. Make no mistake, they’re an AI powerhouse. It’s just that they’re not focused on selling the sizzle. In the current world, where companies blare out press releases at the faintest whiff of anything AI-related to entice investors, Booz Allen Hamilton — armed with bona fide credentials — opts to toil diligently away from the limelight. Perhaps it’s by design, though. Considering this is a company that lists its fiscal 2024 revenue with most projects cloaked in secrecy. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here with all their classified contracts. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. So what happens now? I’ve already tipped my hand and no longer hold any BAH shares. My play has come and gone. Considering today's pullback, I bought a small number of September and December calls. Now, after reading this essay, could someone consider investing in Booz Allen Hamilton? Maybe. AI is set to grow, the U.S. government is bound to expand its AI use, and this company is already well-positioned to secure more projects. So, why am I not invested in BAH? Because I’m neither an investor nor a position trader. I’m a short-term swing trader. I played this earnings catalyst, made some profit, and then walked away. Granted, after this deep dive, I’ll keep an eye on BAH and might tag along if she sets up for a northward run. But I know my timeframe. I know my trading style and my limitations. Likewise, it’s up to you to know your trading style and decide what to do with this information. Keep in mind, BAH experienced some volatility selling, and the implied volatility dipped post-earnings and guidance. Probably because some who positioned ahead of earnings were expecting a bigger leap. It’s logical to assume some will take their profits (as we saw today), so don't jump blindly. On the flip side, these earnings mostly flew under the radar. Booz Allen Hamilton remains an AI colossus that most retail traders haven’t even heard of. Besides, do you know how many will actually read this and understand the information? At any rate, now you know what I know. Have a great day.",Good stuff Alfresco.,2,0.527,0.999,POSITIVE
,"My deep dive on Booz Allen Hamilton’s AI dominance and what it means for traders I'm sharing my research so YOU can make a better decision. I know many members prefer to be told what to buy, but this is an essay, not a BanBet. My current BanBet record is 31-20, which is so-so. But honestly, you should still learn how to trade, not how to shadow. So why should you read this? That's something you have to decide. Read the title. Only you can decide whether it makes sense to find out more about this company, or not. This is the only image I can post here. 🙁 ❗️ TL;DR: Look here, this essay’s got more words than a politician’s promise, and it doesn't even spoon-feeds you a play. Preposterous! If you’re itching to block me, here’s your guide. Now, if the sheer volume of words is giving you the vapors, I don’t blame you. Just look at this behemoth of text. By golly! Let’s face it: you don’t really want to be here, and you’re likely not my audience (folks who actually enjoy reading and/or appreciate knowledge). So, I’d just as soon see you off. Sure, you could go outside and indulge in memes, but I wager you’ve got a primal need to scroll down and leave a gripe about how absurd it is to expect anyone to wade through this verbosity. Well, go ahead. Vent away. Hello. Welcome. You should already know that in today's financial markets, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as the golden prodigy, with investors flocking like bees to honey, eagerly snapping up stocks from those trailblazing companies leading the AI revolution. Amidst this fervor, one company stands as the top purveyor of AI services to the U.S. government. Yet, it remains unknown to the general populace. This essay delves into why Booz Allen Hamilton has earned this position, the significant impact of its AI initiatives, and what this means for traders keen to ride the AI boom. Interested? Keep reading, then. ⚠️ WARNING: I originally wrote this research before Booz Allen Hamilton’s fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 results. Fiscal year, not a calendar year. And I did share my findings with other traders on time. If you are reading this now, that event is already in the past. However, the research is still valid, so I’m posting it here. ⚠️ DISCLAIMER: In their diaphanous wisdom, Reddit/Mods have decreed that posts be limited to a single attachment, which I’ve already used. This essay is adorned with several images to enhance its appeal and, more crucially, includes numerous charts, which I am regrettably unable to include here. If you wish to peruse the full essay with all its illustrative charts, here’s the link. You can continue reading it here on WSB, but be forewarned—you’ll miss out on the visual aids that bring the data to life. The choice, dear reader, is yours. Well now, picture this: The clock has just struck midnight, and today — Friday, May 24, 2024 — has only begun to stretch its legs. I literally just mentioned that I originally wrote this research before Booz Allen Hamilton’s fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 results. Just a few hours ago, I went and bought myself a trunk full of Booz Allen Hamilton shares. And wouldn’t you know it, in just a handful of hours, that very company is set to unveil their earnings report, promising a significant move in the stock, one way or another. Again, I wrote this last week before the earnings. I leaped into this play guided by my trader’s intuition. Now, as I burn the midnight oil, I’m digging into the logic and facts behind that decision. I figured, heck, why not pen an essay about the things I uncover along the way? the number one provider of artificial intelligence (AI) services to the U.S. government. A bit of history Booz Allen Hamilton is no hip upstart. Nope. This institution was founded way back in 1914 by one Edwin G. Booz in the bustling city of Chicago, offering management consulting services before it was even fashionable. During the 1940s, it played a pivotal role in World War II, aiding the U.S. military in improving efficiency and logistics. A decade later, the firm found a niche working with U.S. defense contracts, cementing its reputation as a trusted advisor to Uncle Sam. So why focus on a company named like a law firm? Well, according to GovWin from Deltek — a leading market intelligence organization — Booz Allen is the number one provider of artificial intelligence (AI) services to the U.S. government. And unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’d know that the market currently embraces anything related to artificial intelligence with open arms and a hearty cheer. AI is the belle of the ball. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. For perspective, exactly one year ago (May 24, 2023), NVIDIA had a market capitalization of $760.2 billion. Today, she’s valued at $2.55 trillion. Why? It’s largely due to the insatiably high demand for its AI chips, which are essential for powering advanced AI applications. A reliable uptrend Booz Allen Hamilton boasts a legacy spanning over a century — they consider it 110 years young — but it wasn’t until 2010 that it opened its doors to public investors, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BAH. And if we take a gander at the company’s story as told by its yearly chart, from a humble low of $11.85 in 2012, Booz Allen has steadily climbed the ladder of success, closing today — or yesterday — at $156.83. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Historical yearly performance of Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) stock) here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. That’s a 1,224% ascent, with only a single slightly red year in between, marring the record in 2021. That’s quite the tale of endurance and growth, wouldn’t you say? Aren’t we late to the party, though? Well, Booz Allen Hamilton’s current market capitalization stands at a tidy $20 billion. It’s nothing to scoff at, mind you, but to put things in perspective, this ranks Booz Allen as the 955th most valuable company. There’s still plenty of rungs left to climb on the ladder and ample room for growth down the road. A significant catalyst I’m sharing a monthly chart. Generally speaking, BAH was meandering sideways for nearly three years.

Following that earnings report, the stock kicked up her heels and went on a 38% run over the next two months. Also, aside from better-than-expected earnings, Booz Allen Hamilton was awarded a $919 million Engineering, Development, Integration, and Technology-based Solutions (EDITS) contract. The contract supports the “Soldier as a System” concept, enhancing warfighter capabilities across multiple Department of Defense (DoD) agencies. The EDITS program promotes collaboration across service boundaries and aims to modernize and equip military tactical units, improving lethality, survivability, and situational awareness. Look at the competition Hold your horses. It’s not just one contract or one project propelling Booz Allen Hamilton skyward. The tide of AI is lifting all boats, so it’s not just one company sailing full steam ahead. Granted, Booz Allen offers a smorgasbord of services, thus facing several competitors in various fields. However, if we narrow our focus to the AI sector, some of the most direct competitors are: Leidos Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: LDOS) Leidos provides AI and machine learning solutions to various U.S. government agencies, including the Department of Defense (DoD).

During the 1940s, it played a pivotal role in World War II, aiding the U.S. military in improving efficiency and logistics. A decade later, the firm found a niche working with U.S. defense contracts, cementing its reputation as a trusted advisor to Uncle Sam. So why focus on a company named like a law firm? Well, according to GovWin from Deltek — a leading market intelligence organization — Booz Allen is the number one provider of artificial intelligence (AI) services to the U.S. government. And unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’d know that the market currently embraces anything related to artificial intelligence with open arms and a hearty cheer. AI is the belle of the ball. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. For perspective, exactly one year ago (May 24, 2023), NVIDIA had a market capitalization of $760.2 billion. Today, she’s valued at $2.55 trillion. Why? It’s largely due to the insatiably high demand for its AI chips, which are essential for powering advanced AI applications. A reliable uptrend Booz Allen Hamilton boasts a legacy spanning over a century — they consider it 110 years young — but it wasn’t until 2010 that it opened its doors to public investors, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BAH. And if we take a gander at the company’s story as told by its yearly chart, from a humble low of $11.85 in 2012, Booz Allen has steadily climbed the ladder of success, closing today — or yesterday — at $156.83. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Historical yearly performance of Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) stock) here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. That’s a 1,224% ascent, with only a single slightly red year in between, marring the record in 2021. That’s quite the tale of endurance and growth, wouldn’t you say? Aren’t we late to the party, though? Well, Booz Allen Hamilton’s current market capitalization stands at a tidy $20 billion. It’s nothing to scoff at, mind you, but to put things in perspective, this ranks Booz Allen as the 955th most valuable company. There’s still plenty of rungs left to climb on the ladder and ample room for growth down the road. A significant catalyst I’m sharing a monthly chart. Generally speaking, BAH was meandering sideways for nearly three years. That is, until a year ago, on May 26, 2023, to be precise. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Monthly performance of Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) stock.

Following that earnings report, the stock kicked up her heels and went on a 38% run over the next two months. Also, aside from better-than-expected earnings, Booz Allen Hamilton was awarded a $919 million Engineering, Development, Integration, and Technology-based Solutions (EDITS) contract. The contract supports the “Soldier as a System” concept, enhancing warfighter capabilities across multiple Department of Defense (DoD) agencies. The EDITS program promotes collaboration across service boundaries and aims to modernize and equip military tactical units, improving lethality, survivability, and situational awareness. Look at the competition Hold your horses. It’s not just one contract or one project propelling Booz Allen Hamilton skyward. The tide of AI is lifting all boats, so it’s not just one company sailing full steam ahead. Granted, Booz Allen offers a smorgasbord of services, thus facing several competitors in various fields. However, if we narrow our focus to the AI sector, some of the most direct competitors are: Leidos Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: LDOS) Leidos provides AI and machine learning solutions to various U.S. government agencies, including the Department of Defense (DoD). Their AI capabilities are integrated into solutions for cybersecurity, data analysis, and operational efficiency in defense and intelligence operations. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Daily performance of Leidos Holdings (LDOS) stock.

As you can see, when earnings roll around, these companies tend to pop and set off on a run northward, much like a hound hot on the trail. Each earnings report can become a potential catalyst, sparking a surge in investor enthusiasm and sending stock prices climbing. That’s what I’m playing. What I played. ----- Other high-profile projects Booz Allen Hamilton is involved in several high-profile projects that leverage AI. Some notable projects include: Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) Booz Allen supports the U.S. Department of Defense’s CJADC2 initiative alongside L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: LHX), which aims to integrate sensors, data, and weapon systems across all military domains — land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace — using AI and machine learning to enhance situational awareness and decision-making capabilities. Project Maven Booz Allen has been a key contractor in Project Maven, an AI program initiated by the Department of Defense, which among other things, aims to analyze video footage from drones using machine learning algorithms to identify objects and patterns, significantly improving intelligence and surveillance operations. Project Linchpin It is the U.S. Army’s first program of record providing an artificial intelligence operations pipeline. It is currently just a $2 million contract to support research and development, but it is anticipated to be followed by subsequent juicier contracts. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. Satellites Booz Allen also made a strategic investment in Albedo, the first company to operate satellites in very low Earth orbit (VLEO), which enables them to offer ultra-high resolution commercial imagery from space. Let’s take a moment to chill because it’s not all black ops and military projects. U.S. Department of Energy On March 12, 2024, Booz Allen Hamilton announced it was awarded a ten-year $550 million contract from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) to support the advancement of high-potential, high-impact, early-stage technologies that generate, store, and use energy in entirely new ways to reduce U.S. emissions, improve energy efficiency, and increase the resiliency and reliability of the U.S. power grid. To give you an idea, ARPA-E is tasked with identifying, shepherding, and accelerating “…the stuff that sounds crazy until it changes the world.” U.S. Environmental Protection Agency On May 8, 2024, the company announced it was awarded a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) to support the agency’s modernization efforts and its mission to protect human health and the environment. Booz Allen won one of four positions on the seven-year Scientific Modeling, Application, Visualization, Computational Science, Software, and Statistical Support (SMAVCS4) BPA, which has a ceiling of $431 million. And many more Booz Allen has nearly 200 active AI projects across defense, national security, and civil missions — including three of the largest AI contracts within the Department of Defense. Understandably, many of them are top secret. 🤐 Late last year, an analyst noted that 2,200 BAH employees are considered ‘AI staff,’ with a staggering 80% holding government security clearances. The company’s AI capabilities are not just extensive but also deeply integrated into sensitive areas of national security. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. For those curious souls wanting to delve deeper, check out Booz Allen Hamilton’s Leading AI for the Federal Government portal. If your stars align, you might even consider applying for a job since they’re growing and looking to fill a multitude of positions. What analysts are saying In a February research report, William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma mentioned that the outbreak of multiple wars and the artificial intelligence boom “have led to an inflection in government tech hiring and bookings that we feel has some serious legs.” And also, that Booz Allen “remains the government’s go-to source to modernize the military and prepare for conflicts.” In fact, the company “has more backlog than it can handle as government spending has surged on Pacific tensions and AI prototyping.” Finally, this week (May 21, 2024), Stifel raised its price target for BAH to $170 from $155 (from the chart above that you can't see, BAH was $156.83), keeping a buy rating since “AI, cyber and IT modernization remain in focus for the government.” Besides, there have been recently approved federal budget and supplemental spending packages. According to data from William Blair, the analyst sentiment towards Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) is overwhelmingly positive. Not a single soul is suggesting to sell, which paints a promising picture for our tale. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image with the current rating distribution. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. This table could be important to see. Their aiSSEMBLE solution Just recently — on April 30, 2024 — Booz Allen Hamilton announced the launch of aiSSEMBLE Baseline, a first-of-its-kind, open-source solution built to simplify the engineering and deployment of AI systems. Booz Allen Hamilton boasts that aiSSEMBLE is the core tool cementing its status as the leading AI provider to the U.S. federal government. If that’s the case, it suggests that this new foundational code, complete with open-source documentation and free for use by government, academic, nonprofit, and commercial entities, could further extend Booz Allen’s lead. It can also help them with talent acquisition. By opening the doors to aiSSEMBLE, Booz Allen is inviting a wave of innovation from all corners — government agencies, universities, nonprofits, and private firms — because some bright sparks out there will undoubtedly create remarkable innovations using aiSSEMBLE, catching Booz Allen’s eye in the process. There’s one kink, though… Booz Allen Hamilton’s own top brass sold shares on May 21, 2024. Those actions were filed with the SEC a day before BHA was scheduled to report earnings. There are eight Form-4s. For those not in the know, a Form-4 is a statement of changes in beneficial ownership of securities by company insiders. But wait a second. Let’s dig deeper. All the Form-4s state they first acquired shares through the vesting of performance-based restricted stock units (RSUs). These RSUs are a form of compensation granted to employees, becoming vested and thereby exercisable or transferable based on achieving specific performance criteria over a set period. In other words, they hit a target — they accomplish a goal — and they’re rewarded with stock. The shares they sold are just a part of the shares acquired. For instance, the CEO — Horacio Rozanski — received 71,575 shares, and he decided to sell 34,571. The EVP & Chief Operating Officer Kristine Anderson acquired 7,544 shares and sold 3,644. Not a single one of them decided to sell the farm and run away. Therefore, they might have sold a portion to cover taxes or diversify their portfolios. This is a common practice and doesn’t necessarily reflect a lack of confidence in the company’s future. Besides, the number of shares sold is minimal compared to the total number they still hold. I told you the CEO sold 34,571 shares, but he is still holding 579,025 more. Kristine sold 3,644, but she still has 72,761. In the end, it is not a red flag. But it was a kink I didn’t appreciate, considering they still decided to sell before earnings. Then again, it’s quite plausible that Booz Allen Hamilton’s top brass might be governed by internal clauses dictating when they can sell their vested shares. After all, many companies have strict trading windows and blackout periods to prevent any appearance of insider trading or conflict of interest. Nonetheless, this was one of the two reasons why I only bought a trunk instead of backing up a Freightliner to load up with shares. How my gambit played out Honestly, there's no point in narrating the play on Reddit since I can't add the entry, premarket charts, profit, or any attachments. So... if you care about how I played this, the link is here. One more insight I learned Booz Allen Hamilton and its helmsman, Horacio Rozanski, aren’t clamoring atop the AI hype train, hollering for investors to crown them the new AI darling everyone should own. Make no mistake, they’re an AI powerhouse. It’s just that they’re not focused on selling the sizzle. In the current world, where companies blare out press releases at the faintest whiff of anything AI-related to entice investors, Booz Allen Hamilton — armed with bona fide credentials — opts to toil diligently away from the limelight. Perhaps it’s by design, though. Considering this is a company that lists its fiscal 2024 revenue with most projects cloaked in secrecy. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here with all their classified contracts. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. So what happens now? I’ve already tipped my hand and no longer hold any BAH shares. My play has come and gone. Considering today's pullback, I bought a small number of September and December calls. Now, after reading this essay, could someone consider investing in Booz Allen Hamilton? Maybe. AI is set to grow, the U.S. government is bound to expand its AI use, and this company is already well-positioned to secure more projects. So, why am I not invested in BAH? Because I’m neither an investor nor a position trader. I’m a short-term swing trader. I played this earnings catalyst, made some profit, and then walked away. Granted, after this deep dive, I’ll keep an eye on BAH and might tag along if she sets up for a northward run. But I know my timeframe. I know my trading style and my limitations. Likewise, it’s up to you to know your trading style and decide what to do with this information. Keep in mind, BAH experienced some volatility selling, and the implied volatility dipped post-earnings and guidance. Probably because some who positioned ahead of earnings were expecting a bigger leap. It’s logical to assume some will take their profits (as we saw today), so don't jump blindly. On the flip side, these earnings mostly flew under the radar. Booz Allen Hamilton remains an AI colossus that most retail traders haven’t even heard of. Besides, do you know how many will actually read this and understand the information? At any rate, now you know what I know. Have a great day.",You mean aiSSEMBLE Baseline?,1,0.502,0.997,NEGATIVE
,"My deep dive on Booz Allen Hamilton’s AI dominance and what it means for traders I'm sharing my research so YOU can make a better decision. I know many members prefer to be told what to buy, but this is an essay, not a BanBet. My current BanBet record is 31-20, which is so-so. But honestly, you should still learn how to trade, not how to shadow. So why should you read this? That's something you have to decide. Read the title. Only you can decide whether it makes sense to find out more about this company, or not. This is the only image I can post here. 🙁 ❗️ TL;DR: Look here, this essay’s got more words than a politician’s promise, and it doesn't even spoon-feeds you a play. Preposterous! If you’re itching to block me, here’s your guide. Now, if the sheer volume of words is giving you the vapors, I don’t blame you. Just look at this behemoth of text. By golly! Let’s face it: you don’t really want to be here, and you’re likely not my audience (folks who actually enjoy reading and/or appreciate knowledge). So, I’d just as soon see you off. Sure, you could go outside and indulge in memes, but I wager you’ve got a primal need to scroll down and leave a gripe about how absurd it is to expect anyone to wade through this verbosity. Well, go ahead. Vent away. Hello. Welcome. You should already know that in today's financial markets, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as the golden prodigy, with investors flocking like bees to honey, eagerly snapping up stocks from those trailblazing companies leading the AI revolution. Amidst this fervor, one company stands as the top purveyor of AI services to the U.S. government. Yet, it remains unknown to the general populace. This essay delves into why Booz Allen Hamilton has earned this position, the significant impact of its AI initiatives, and what this means for traders keen to ride the AI boom. Interested? Keep reading, then. ⚠️ WARNING: I originally wrote this research before Booz Allen Hamilton’s fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 results. Fiscal year, not a calendar year. And I did share my findings with other traders on time. If you are reading this now, that event is already in the past. However, the research is still valid, so I’m posting it here. ⚠️ DISCLAIMER: In their diaphanous wisdom, Reddit/Mods have decreed that posts be limited to a single attachment, which I’ve already used. This essay is adorned with several images to enhance its appeal and, more crucially, includes numerous charts, which I am regrettably unable to include here.

I literally just mentioned that I originally wrote this research before Booz Allen Hamilton’s fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 results. Just a few hours ago, I went and bought myself a trunk full of Booz Allen Hamilton shares. And wouldn’t you know it, in just a handful of hours, that very company is set to unveil their earnings report, promising a significant move in the stock, one way or another. Again, I wrote this last week before the earnings. I leaped into this play guided by my trader’s intuition. Now, as I burn the midnight oil, I’m digging into the logic and facts behind that decision. I figured, heck, why not pen an essay about the things I uncover along the way? the number one provider of artificial intelligence (AI) services to the U.S. government.

Granted, after this deep dive, I’ll keep an eye on BAH and might tag along if she sets up for a northward run. But I know my timeframe. I know my trading style and my limitations. Likewise, it’s up to you to know your trading style and decide what to do with this information. Keep in mind, BAH experienced some volatility selling, and the implied volatility dipped post-earnings and guidance. Probably because some who positioned ahead of earnings were expecting a bigger leap. It’s logical to assume some will take their profits (as we saw today), so don't jump blindly. On the flip side, these earnings mostly flew under the radar. Booz Allen Hamilton remains an AI colossus that most retail traders haven’t even heard of. Besides, do you know how many will actually read this and understand the information? At any rate, now you know what I know. Have a great day.",man you missed out lol,1,0.502,0.989,POSITIVE
,"My deep dive on Booz Allen Hamilton’s AI dominance and what it means for traders I'm sharing my research so YOU can make a better decision. I know many members prefer to be told what to buy, but this is an essay, not a BanBet. My current BanBet record is 31-20, which is so-so. But honestly, you should still learn how to trade, not how to shadow. So why should you read this? That's something you have to decide. Read the title. Only you can decide whether it makes sense to find out more about this company, or not. This is the only image I can post here. 🙁 ❗️ TL;DR: Look here, this essay’s got more words than a politician’s promise, and it doesn't even spoon-feeds you a play. Preposterous! If you’re itching to block me, here’s your guide. Now, if the sheer volume of words is giving you the vapors, I don’t blame you. Just look at this behemoth of text. By golly! Let’s face it: you don’t really want to be here, and you’re likely not my audience (folks who actually enjoy reading and/or appreciate knowledge). So, I’d just as soon see you off. Sure, you could go outside and indulge in memes, but I wager you’ve got a primal need to scroll down and leave a gripe about how absurd it is to expect anyone to wade through this verbosity. Well, go ahead. Vent away. Hello. Welcome. You should already know that in today's financial markets, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as the golden prodigy, with investors flocking like bees to honey, eagerly snapping up stocks from those trailblazing companies leading the AI revolution. Amidst this fervor, one company stands as the top purveyor of AI services to the U.S. government. Yet, it remains unknown to the general populace. This essay delves into why Booz Allen Hamilton has earned this position, the significant impact of its AI initiatives, and what this means for traders keen to ride the AI boom. Interested? Keep reading, then. ⚠️ WARNING: I originally wrote this research before Booz Allen Hamilton’s fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 results. Fiscal year, not a calendar year. And I did share my findings with other traders on time. If you are reading this now, that event is already in the past. However, the research is still valid, so I’m posting it here. ⚠️ DISCLAIMER: In their diaphanous wisdom, Reddit/Mods have decreed that posts be limited to a single attachment, which I’ve already used. This essay is adorned with several images to enhance its appeal and, more crucially, includes numerous charts, which I am regrettably unable to include here.

You can continue reading it here on WSB, but be forewarned—you’ll miss out on the visual aids that bring the data to life. The choice, dear reader, is yours. Well now, picture this: The clock has just struck midnight, and today — Friday, May 24, 2024 — has only begun to stretch its legs. I literally just mentioned that I originally wrote this research before Booz Allen Hamilton’s fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 results. Just a few hours ago, I went and bought myself a trunk full of Booz Allen Hamilton shares. And wouldn’t you know it, in just a handful of hours, that very company is set to unveil their earnings report, promising a significant move in the stock, one way or another. Again, I wrote this last week before the earnings. I leaped into this play guided by my trader’s intuition. Now, as I burn the midnight oil, I’m digging into the logic and facts behind that decision. I figured, heck, why not pen an essay about the things I uncover along the way? the number one provider of artificial intelligence (AI) services to the U.S. government. A bit of history Booz Allen Hamilton is no hip upstart. Nope. This institution was founded way back in 1914 by one Edwin G. Booz in the bustling city of Chicago, offering management consulting services before it was even fashionable. During the 1940s, it played a pivotal role in World War II, aiding the U.S. military in improving efficiency and logistics. A decade later, the firm found a niche working with U.S. defense contracts, cementing its reputation as a trusted advisor to Uncle Sam. So why focus on a company named like a law firm? Well, according to GovWin from Deltek — a leading market intelligence organization — Booz Allen is the number one provider of artificial intelligence (AI) services to the U.S. government. And unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’d know that the market currently embraces anything related to artificial intelligence with open arms and a hearty cheer. AI is the belle of the ball. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. For perspective, exactly one year ago (May 24, 2023), NVIDIA had a market capitalization of $760.2 billion. Today, she’s valued at $2.55 trillion. Why? It’s largely due to the insatiably high demand for its AI chips, which are essential for powering advanced AI applications. A reliable uptrend Booz Allen Hamilton boasts a legacy spanning over a century — they consider it 110 years young — but it wasn’t until 2010 that it opened its doors to public investors, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BAH. And if we take a gander at the company’s story as told by its yearly chart, from a humble low of $11.85 in 2012, Booz Allen has steadily climbed the ladder of success, closing today — or yesterday — at $156.83. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Historical yearly performance of Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) stock) here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. That’s a 1,224% ascent, with only a single slightly red year in between, marring the record in 2021. That’s quite the tale of endurance and growth, wouldn’t you say? Aren’t we late to the party, though? Well, Booz Allen Hamilton’s current market capitalization stands at a tidy $20 billion. It’s nothing to scoff at, mind you, but to put things in perspective, this ranks Booz Allen as the 955th most valuable company. There’s still plenty of rungs left to climb on the ladder and ample room for growth down the road. A significant catalyst I’m sharing a monthly chart. Generally speaking, BAH was meandering sideways for nearly three years. That is, until a year ago, on May 26, 2023, to be precise. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Monthly performance of Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) stock. The price level illustrates a resistance/support level between August 2020 and May 2023.) here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. Following that earnings report, the stock kicked up her heels and went on a 38% run over the next two months. Also, aside from better-than-expected earnings, Booz Allen Hamilton was awarded a $919 million Engineering, Development, Integration, and Technology-based Solutions (EDITS) contract. The contract supports the “Soldier as a System” concept, enhancing warfighter capabilities across multiple Department of Defense (DoD) agencies. The EDITS program promotes collaboration across service boundaries and aims to modernize and equip military tactical units, improving lethality, survivability, and situational awareness. Look at the competition Hold your horses. It’s not just one contract or one project propelling Booz Allen Hamilton skyward. The tide of AI is lifting all boats, so it’s not just one company sailing full steam ahead. Granted, Booz Allen offers a smorgasbord of services, thus facing several competitors in various fields. However, if we narrow our focus to the AI sector, some of the most direct competitors are: Leidos Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: LDOS) Leidos provides AI and machine learning solutions to various U.S. government agencies, including the Department of Defense (DoD). Their AI capabilities are integrated into solutions for cybersecurity, data analysis, and operational efficiency in defense and intelligence operations. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Daily performance of Leidos Holdings (LDOS) stock.

As you can see, when earnings roll around, these companies tend to pop and set off on a run northward, much like a hound hot on the trail. Each earnings report can become a potential catalyst, sparking a surge in investor enthusiasm and sending stock prices climbing. That’s what I’m playing. What I played. ----- Other high-profile projects Booz Allen Hamilton is involved in several high-profile projects that leverage AI. Some notable projects include: Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) Booz Allen supports the U.S. Department of Defense’s CJADC2 initiative alongside L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: LHX), which aims to integrate sensors, data, and weapon systems across all military domains — land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace — using AI and machine learning to enhance situational awareness and decision-making capabilities. Project Maven Booz Allen has been a key contractor in Project Maven, an AI program initiated by the Department of Defense, which among other things, aims to analyze video footage from drones using machine learning algorithms to identify objects and patterns, significantly improving intelligence and surveillance operations. Project Linchpin It is the U.S. Army’s first program of record providing an artificial intelligence operations pipeline. It is currently just a $2 million contract to support research and development, but it is anticipated to be followed by subsequent juicier contracts. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. Satellites Booz Allen also made a strategic investment in Albedo, the first company to operate satellites in very low Earth orbit (VLEO), which enables them to offer ultra-high resolution commercial imagery from space. Let’s take a moment to chill because it’s not all black ops and military projects. U.S. Department of Energy On March 12, 2024, Booz Allen Hamilton announced it was awarded a ten-year $550 million contract from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) to support the advancement of high-potential, high-impact, early-stage technologies that generate, store, and use energy in entirely new ways to reduce U.S. emissions, improve energy efficiency, and increase the resiliency and reliability of the U.S. power grid. To give you an idea, ARPA-E is tasked with identifying, shepherding, and accelerating “…the stuff that sounds crazy until it changes the world.” U.S. Environmental Protection Agency On May 8, 2024, the company announced it was awarded a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) to support the agency’s modernization efforts and its mission to protect human health and the environment. Booz Allen won one of four positions on the seven-year Scientific Modeling, Application, Visualization, Computational Science, Software, and Statistical Support (SMAVCS4) BPA, which has a ceiling of $431 million. And many more Booz Allen has nearly 200 active AI projects across defense, national security, and civil missions — including three of the largest AI contracts within the Department of Defense. Understandably, many of them are top secret. 🤐 Late last year, an analyst noted that 2,200 BAH employees are considered ‘AI staff,’ with a staggering 80% holding government security clearances. The company’s AI capabilities are not just extensive but also deeply integrated into sensitive areas of national security. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. For those curious souls wanting to delve deeper, check out Booz Allen Hamilton’s Leading AI for the Federal Government portal. If your stars align, you might even consider applying for a job since they’re growing and looking to fill a multitude of positions. What analysts are saying In a February research report, William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma mentioned that the outbreak of multiple wars and the artificial intelligence boom “have led to an inflection in government tech hiring and bookings that we feel has some serious legs.” And also, that Booz Allen “remains the government’s go-to source to modernize the military and prepare for conflicts.” In fact, the company “has more backlog than it can handle as government spending has surged on Pacific tensions and AI prototyping.” Finally, this week (May 21, 2024), Stifel raised its price target for BAH to $170 from $155 (from the chart above that you can't see, BAH was $156.83), keeping a buy rating since “AI, cyber and IT modernization remain in focus for the government.” Besides, there have been recently approved federal budget and supplemental spending packages. According to data from William Blair, the analyst sentiment towards Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) is overwhelmingly positive. Not a single soul is suggesting to sell, which paints a promising picture for our tale. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image with the current rating distribution. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. This table could be important to see. Their aiSSEMBLE solution Just recently — on April 30, 2024 — Booz Allen Hamilton announced the launch of aiSSEMBLE Baseline, a first-of-its-kind, open-source solution built to simplify the engineering and deployment of AI systems. Booz Allen Hamilton boasts that aiSSEMBLE is the core tool cementing its status as the leading AI provider to the U.S. federal government. If that’s the case, it suggests that this new foundational code, complete with open-source documentation and free for use by government, academic, nonprofit, and commercial entities, could further extend Booz Allen’s lead. It can also help them with talent acquisition. By opening the doors to aiSSEMBLE, Booz Allen is inviting a wave of innovation from all corners — government agencies, universities, nonprofits, and private firms — because some bright sparks out there will undoubtedly create remarkable innovations using aiSSEMBLE, catching Booz Allen’s eye in the process. There’s one kink, though… Booz Allen Hamilton’s own top brass sold shares on May 21, 2024. Those actions were filed with the SEC a day before BHA was scheduled to report earnings. There are eight Form-4s. For those not in the know, a Form-4 is a statement of changes in beneficial ownership of securities by company insiders. But wait a second. Let’s dig deeper. All the Form-4s state they first acquired shares through the vesting of performance-based restricted stock units (RSUs). These RSUs are a form of compensation granted to employees, becoming vested and thereby exercisable or transferable based on achieving specific performance criteria over a set period. In other words, they hit a target — they accomplish a goal — and they’re rewarded with stock. The shares they sold are just a part of the shares acquired. For instance, the CEO — Horacio Rozanski — received 71,575 shares, and he decided to sell 34,571. The EVP & Chief Operating Officer Kristine Anderson acquired 7,544 shares and sold 3,644. Not a single one of them decided to sell the farm and run away. Therefore, they might have sold a portion to cover taxes or diversify their portfolios. This is a common practice and doesn’t necessarily reflect a lack of confidence in the company’s future. Besides, the number of shares sold is minimal compared to the total number they still hold. I told you the CEO sold 34,571 shares, but he is still holding 579,025 more. Kristine sold 3,644, but she still has 72,761. In the end, it is not a red flag. But it was a kink I didn’t appreciate, considering they still decided to sell before earnings. Then again, it’s quite plausible that Booz Allen Hamilton’s top brass might be governed by internal clauses dictating when they can sell their vested shares. After all, many companies have strict trading windows and blackout periods to prevent any appearance of insider trading or conflict of interest. Nonetheless, this was one of the two reasons why I only bought a trunk instead of backing up a Freightliner to load up with shares. How my gambit played out Honestly, there's no point in narrating the play on Reddit since I can't add the entry, premarket charts, profit, or any attachments. So... if you care about how I played this, the link is here. One more insight I learned Booz Allen Hamilton and its helmsman, Horacio Rozanski, aren’t clamoring atop the AI hype train, hollering for investors to crown them the new AI darling everyone should own. Make no mistake, they’re an AI powerhouse. It’s just that they’re not focused on selling the sizzle. In the current world, where companies blare out press releases at the faintest whiff of anything AI-related to entice investors, Booz Allen Hamilton — armed with bona fide credentials — opts to toil diligently away from the limelight. Perhaps it’s by design, though. Considering this is a company that lists its fiscal 2024 revenue with most projects cloaked in secrecy. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here with all their classified contracts. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. So what happens now? I’ve already tipped my hand and no longer hold any BAH shares. My play has come and gone. Considering today's pullback, I bought a small number of September and December calls. Now, after reading this essay, could someone consider investing in Booz Allen Hamilton? Maybe. AI is set to grow, the U.S. government is bound to expand its AI use, and this company is already well-positioned to secure more projects. So, why am I not invested in BAH? Because I’m neither an investor nor a position trader. I’m a short-term swing trader. I played this earnings catalyst, made some profit, and then walked away. Granted, after this deep dive, I’ll keep an eye on BAH and might tag along if she sets up for a northward run. But I know my timeframe. I know my trading style and my limitations.

What analysts are saying In a February research report, William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma mentioned that the outbreak of multiple wars and the artificial intelligence boom “have led to an inflection in government tech hiring and bookings that we feel has some serious legs.” And also, that Booz Allen “remains the government’s go-to source to modernize the military and prepare for conflicts.” In fact, the company “has more backlog than it can handle as government spending has surged on Pacific tensions and AI prototyping.” Finally, this week (May 21, 2024), Stifel raised its price target for BAH to $170 from $155 (from the chart above that you can't see, BAH was $156.83), keeping a buy rating since “AI, cyber and IT modernization remain in focus for the government.” Besides, there have been recently approved federal budget and supplemental spending packages. According to data from William Blair, the analyst sentiment towards Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) is overwhelmingly positive. Not a single soul is suggesting to sell, which paints a promising picture for our tale. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image with the current rating distribution. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. This table could be important to see. Their aiSSEMBLE solution Just recently — on April 30, 2024 — Booz Allen Hamilton announced the launch of aiSSEMBLE Baseline, a first-of-its-kind, open-source solution built to simplify the engineering and deployment of AI systems. Booz Allen Hamilton boasts that aiSSEMBLE is the core tool cementing its status as the leading AI provider to the U.S. federal government. If that’s the case, it suggests that this new foundational code, complete with open-source documentation and free for use by government, academic, nonprofit, and commercial entities, could further extend Booz Allen’s lead. It can also help them with talent acquisition. By opening the doors to aiSSEMBLE, Booz Allen is inviting a wave of innovation from all corners — government agencies, universities, nonprofits, and private firms — because some bright sparks out there will undoubtedly create remarkable innovations using aiSSEMBLE, catching Booz Allen’s eye in the process. There’s one kink, though… Booz Allen Hamilton’s own top brass sold shares on May 21, 2024. Those actions were filed with the SEC a day before BHA was scheduled to report earnings. There are eight Form-4s. For those not in the know, a Form-4 is a statement of changes in beneficial ownership of securities by company insiders. But wait a second. Let’s dig deeper. All the Form-4s state they first acquired shares through the vesting of performance-based restricted stock units (RSUs). These RSUs are a form of compensation granted to employees, becoming vested and thereby exercisable or transferable based on achieving specific performance criteria over a set period. In other words, they hit a target — they accomplish a goal — and they’re rewarded with stock. The shares they sold are just a part of the shares acquired. For instance, the CEO — Horacio Rozanski — received 71,575 shares, and he decided to sell 34,571. The EVP & Chief Operating Officer Kristine Anderson acquired 7,544 shares and sold 3,644. Not a single one of them decided to sell the farm and run away. Therefore, they might have sold a portion to cover taxes or diversify their portfolios. This is a common practice and doesn’t necessarily reflect a lack of confidence in the company’s future. Besides, the number of shares sold is minimal compared to the total number they still hold. I told you the CEO sold 34,571 shares, but he is still holding 579,025 more. Kristine sold 3,644, but she still has 72,761. In the end, it is not a red flag. But it was a kink I didn’t appreciate, considering they still decided to sell before earnings. Then again, it’s quite plausible that Booz Allen Hamilton’s top brass might be governed by internal clauses dictating when they can sell their vested shares. After all, many companies have strict trading windows and blackout periods to prevent any appearance of insider trading or conflict of interest. Nonetheless, this was one of the two reasons why I only bought a trunk instead of backing up a Freightliner to load up with shares. How my gambit played out Honestly, there's no point in narrating the play on Reddit since I can't add the entry, premarket charts, profit, or any attachments. So... if you care about how I played this, the link is here. One more insight I learned Booz Allen Hamilton and its helmsman, Horacio Rozanski, aren’t clamoring atop the AI hype train, hollering for investors to crown them the new AI darling everyone should own. Make no mistake, they’re an AI powerhouse. It’s just that they’re not focused on selling the sizzle. In the current world, where companies blare out press releases at the faintest whiff of anything AI-related to entice investors, Booz Allen Hamilton — armed with bona fide credentials — opts to toil diligently away from the limelight. Perhaps it’s by design, though. Considering this is a company that lists its fiscal 2024 revenue with most projects cloaked in secrecy. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here with all their classified contracts. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. So what happens now? I’ve already tipped my hand and no longer hold any BAH shares. My play has come and gone. Considering today's pullback, I bought a small number of September and December calls. Now, after reading this essay, could someone consider investing in Booz Allen Hamilton? Maybe. AI is set to grow, the U.S. government is bound to expand its AI use, and this company is already well-positioned to secure more projects. So, why am I not invested in BAH? Because I’m neither an investor nor a position trader. I’m a short-term swing trader. I played this earnings catalyst, made some profit, and then walked away. Granted, after this deep dive, I’ll keep an eye on BAH and might tag along if she sets up for a northward run. But I know my timeframe. I know my trading style and my limitations. Likewise, it’s up to you to know your trading style and decide what to do with this information. Keep in mind, BAH experienced some volatility selling, and the implied volatility dipped post-earnings and guidance. Probably because some who positioned ahead of earnings were expecting a bigger leap. It’s logical to assume some will take their profits (as we saw today), so don't jump blindly. On the flip side, these earnings mostly flew under the radar. Booz Allen Hamilton remains an AI colossus that most retail traders haven’t even heard of. Besides, do you know how many will actually read this and understand the information? At any rate, now you know what I know.

,"My deep dive on Booz Allen Hamilton’s AI dominance and what it means for traders I'm sharing my research so YOU can make a better decision. I know many members prefer to be told what to buy, but this is an essay, not a BanBet. My current BanBet record is 31-20, which is so-so. But honestly, you should still learn how to trade, not how to shadow. So why should you read this? That's something you have to decide. Read the title. Only you can decide whether it makes sense to find out more about this company, or not. This is the only image I can post here. 🙁 ❗️ TL;DR: Look here, this essay’s got more words than a politician’s promise, and it doesn't even spoon-feeds you a play. Preposterous! If you’re itching to block me, here’s your guide. Now, if the sheer volume of words is giving you the vapors, I don’t blame you. Just look at this behemoth of text. By golly! Let’s face it: you don’t really want to be here, and you’re likely not my audience (folks who actually enjoy reading and/or appreciate knowledge). So, I’d just as soon see you off. Sure, you could go outside and indulge in memes, but I wager you’ve got a primal need to scroll down and leave a gripe about how absurd it is to expect anyone to wade through this verbosity. Well, go ahead. Vent away. Hello. Welcome. You should already know that in today's financial markets, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as the golden prodigy, with investors flocking like bees to honey, eagerly snapping up stocks from those trailblazing companies leading the AI revolution. Amidst this fervor, one company stands as the top purveyor of AI services to the U.S. government. Yet, it remains unknown to the general populace. This essay delves into why Booz Allen Hamilton has earned this position, the significant impact of its AI initiatives, and what this means for traders keen to ride the AI boom. Interested? Keep reading, then. ⚠️ WARNING: I originally wrote this research before Booz Allen Hamilton’s fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 results. Fiscal year, not a calendar year. And I did share my findings with other traders on time. If you are reading this now, that event is already in the past. However, the research is still valid, so I’m posting it here. ⚠️ DISCLAIMER: In their diaphanous wisdom, Reddit/Mods have decreed that posts be limited to a single attachment, which I’ve already used. This essay is adorned with several images to enhance its appeal and, more crucially, includes numerous charts, which I am regrettably unable to include here.

You can continue reading it here on WSB, but be forewarned—you’ll miss out on the visual aids that bring the data to life. The choice, dear reader, is yours. Well now, picture this: The clock has just struck midnight, and today — Friday, May 24, 2024 — has only begun to stretch its legs. I literally just mentioned that I originally wrote this research before Booz Allen Hamilton’s fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 results. Just a few hours ago, I went and bought myself a trunk full of Booz Allen Hamilton shares. And wouldn’t you know it, in just a handful of hours, that very company is set to unveil their earnings report, promising a significant move in the stock, one way or another. Again, I wrote this last week before the earnings. I leaped into this play guided by my trader’s intuition. Now, as I burn the midnight oil, I’m digging into the logic and facts behind that decision. I figured, heck, why not pen an essay about the things I uncover along the way? the number one provider of artificial intelligence (AI) services to the U.S. government. A bit of history Booz Allen Hamilton is no hip upstart. Nope. This institution was founded way back in 1914 by one Edwin G. Booz in the bustling city of Chicago, offering management consulting services before it was even fashionable. During the 1940s, it played a pivotal role in World War II, aiding the U.S. military in improving efficiency and logistics. A decade later, the firm found a niche working with U.S. defense contracts, cementing its reputation as a trusted advisor to Uncle Sam. So why focus on a company named like a law firm? Well, according to GovWin from Deltek — a leading market intelligence organization — Booz Allen is the number one provider of artificial intelligence (AI) services to the U.S. government. And unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’d know that the market currently embraces anything related to artificial intelligence with open arms and a hearty cheer. AI is the belle of the ball. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. For perspective, exactly one year ago (May 24, 2023), NVIDIA had a market capitalization of $760.2 billion. Today, she’s valued at $2.55 trillion. Why? It’s largely due to the insatiably high demand for its AI chips, which are essential for powering advanced AI applications. A reliable uptrend Booz Allen Hamilton boasts a legacy spanning over a century — they consider it 110 years young — but it wasn’t until 2010 that it opened its doors to public investors, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BAH. And if we take a gander at the company’s story as told by its yearly chart, from a humble low of $11.85 in 2012, Booz Allen has steadily climbed the ladder of success, closing today — or yesterday — at $156.83. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Historical yearly performance of Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) stock) here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. That’s a 1,224% ascent, with only a single slightly red year in between, marring the record in 2021. That’s quite the tale of endurance and growth, wouldn’t you say? Aren’t we late to the party, though? Well, Booz Allen Hamilton’s current market capitalization stands at a tidy $20 billion. It’s nothing to scoff at, mind you, but to put things in perspective, this ranks Booz Allen as the 955th most valuable company. There’s still plenty of rungs left to climb on the ladder and ample room for growth down the road. A significant catalyst I’m sharing a monthly chart. Generally speaking, BAH was meandering sideways for nearly three years. That is, until a year ago, on May 26, 2023, to be precise. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Monthly performance of Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) stock. The price level illustrates a resistance/support level between August 2020 and May 2023.) here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. Following that earnings report, the stock kicked up her heels and went on a 38% run over the next two months. Also, aside from better-than-expected earnings, Booz Allen Hamilton was awarded a $919 million Engineering, Development, Integration, and Technology-based Solutions (EDITS) contract. The contract supports the “Soldier as a System” concept, enhancing warfighter capabilities across multiple Department of Defense (DoD) agencies. The EDITS program promotes collaboration across service boundaries and aims to modernize and equip military tactical units, improving lethality, survivability, and situational awareness. Look at the competition Hold your horses. It’s not just one contract or one project propelling Booz Allen Hamilton skyward. The tide of AI is lifting all boats, so it’s not just one company sailing full steam ahead. Granted, Booz Allen offers a smorgasbord of services, thus facing several competitors in various fields. However, if we narrow our focus to the AI sector, some of the most direct competitors are: Leidos Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: LDOS) Leidos provides AI and machine learning solutions to various U.S. government agencies, including the Department of Defense (DoD). Their AI capabilities are integrated into solutions for cybersecurity, data analysis, and operational efficiency in defense and intelligence operations. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Daily performance of Leidos Holdings (LDOS) stock.

As you can see, when earnings roll around, these companies tend to pop and set off on a run northward, much like a hound hot on the trail. Each earnings report can become a potential catalyst, sparking a surge in investor enthusiasm and sending stock prices climbing. That’s what I’m playing. What I played. ----- Other high-profile projects Booz Allen Hamilton is involved in several high-profile projects that leverage AI. Some notable projects include: Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) Booz Allen supports the U.S. Department of Defense’s CJADC2 initiative alongside L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: LHX), which aims to integrate sensors, data, and weapon systems across all military domains — land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace — using AI and machine learning to enhance situational awareness and decision-making capabilities. Project Maven Booz Allen has been a key contractor in Project Maven, an AI program initiated by the Department of Defense, which among other things, aims to analyze video footage from drones using machine learning algorithms to identify objects and patterns, significantly improving intelligence and surveillance operations. Project Linchpin It is the U.S. Army’s first program of record providing an artificial intelligence operations pipeline. It is currently just a $2 million contract to support research and development, but it is anticipated to be followed by subsequent juicier contracts. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. Satellites Booz Allen also made a strategic investment in Albedo, the first company to operate satellites in very low Earth orbit (VLEO), which enables them to offer ultra-high resolution commercial imagery from space. Let’s take a moment to chill because it’s not all black ops and military projects. U.S. Department of Energy On March 12, 2024, Booz Allen Hamilton announced it was awarded a ten-year $550 million contract from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) to support the advancement of high-potential, high-impact, early-stage technologies that generate, store, and use energy in entirely new ways to reduce U.S. emissions, improve energy efficiency, and increase the resiliency and reliability of the U.S. power grid. To give you an idea, ARPA-E is tasked with identifying, shepherding, and accelerating “…the stuff that sounds crazy until it changes the world.” U.S. Environmental Protection Agency On May 8, 2024, the company announced it was awarded a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) to support the agency’s modernization efforts and its mission to protect human health and the environment. Booz Allen won one of four positions on the seven-year Scientific Modeling, Application, Visualization, Computational Science, Software, and Statistical Support (SMAVCS4) BPA, which has a ceiling of $431 million. And many more Booz Allen has nearly 200 active AI projects across defense, national security, and civil missions — including three of the largest AI contracts within the Department of Defense. Understandably, many of them are top secret. 🤐 Late last year, an analyst noted that 2,200 BAH employees are considered ‘AI staff,’ with a staggering 80% holding government security clearances. The company’s AI capabilities are not just extensive but also deeply integrated into sensitive areas of national security. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here.

The EDITS program promotes collaboration across service boundaries and aims to modernize and equip military tactical units, improving lethality, survivability, and situational awareness. Look at the competition Hold your horses. It’s not just one contract or one project propelling Booz Allen Hamilton skyward. The tide of AI is lifting all boats, so it’s not just one company sailing full steam ahead. Granted, Booz Allen offers a smorgasbord of services, thus facing several competitors in various fields. However, if we narrow our focus to the AI sector, some of the most direct competitors are: Leidos Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: LDOS) Leidos provides AI and machine learning solutions to various U.S. government agencies, including the Department of Defense (DoD). Their AI capabilities are integrated into solutions for cybersecurity, data analysis, and operational efficiency in defense and intelligence operations. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Daily performance of Leidos Holdings (LDOS) stock.

CACI International Inc (NYSE: CACI) CACI offers AI-driven solutions to enhance national security, defense, and intelligence operations. Their AI products include advanced analytics, machine learning models, and AI applications that support mission-critical tasks for the U.S. government. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Daily performance of CACI International (CACI) stock.

As you can see, when earnings roll around, these companies tend to pop and set off on a run northward, much like a hound hot on the trail. Each earnings report can become a potential catalyst, sparking a surge in investor enthusiasm and sending stock prices climbing. That’s what I’m playing. What I played. ----- Other high-profile projects Booz Allen Hamilton is involved in several high-profile projects that leverage AI. Some notable projects include: Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) Booz Allen supports the U.S. Department of Defense’s CJADC2 initiative alongside L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: LHX), which aims to integrate sensors, data, and weapon systems across all military domains — land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace — using AI and machine learning to enhance situational awareness and decision-making capabilities. Project Maven Booz Allen has been a key contractor in Project Maven, an AI program initiated by the Department of Defense, which among other things, aims to analyze video footage from drones using machine learning algorithms to identify objects and patterns, significantly improving intelligence and surveillance operations. Project Linchpin It is the U.S. Army’s first program of record providing an artificial intelligence operations pipeline. It is currently just a $2 million contract to support research and development, but it is anticipated to be followed by subsequent juicier contracts. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. Satellites Booz Allen also made a strategic investment in Albedo, the first company to operate satellites in very low Earth orbit (VLEO), which enables them to offer ultra-high resolution commercial imagery from space. Let’s take a moment to chill because it’s not all black ops and military projects. U.S. Department of Energy On March 12, 2024, Booz Allen Hamilton announced it was awarded a ten-year $550 million contract from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) to support the advancement of high-potential, high-impact, early-stage technologies that generate, store, and use energy in entirely new ways to reduce U.S. emissions, improve energy efficiency, and increase the resiliency and reliability of the U.S. power grid. To give you an idea, ARPA-E is tasked with identifying, shepherding, and accelerating “…the stuff that sounds crazy until it changes the world.” U.S. Environmental Protection Agency On May 8, 2024, the company announced it was awarded a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) to support the agency’s modernization efforts and its mission to protect human health and the environment. Booz Allen won one of four positions on the seven-year Scientific Modeling, Application, Visualization, Computational Science, Software, and Statistical Support (SMAVCS4) BPA, which has a ceiling of $431 million. And many more Booz Allen has nearly 200 active AI projects across defense, national security, and civil missions — including three of the largest AI contracts within the Department of Defense. Understandably, many of them are top secret. 🤐 Late last year, an analyst noted that 2,200 BAH employees are considered ‘AI staff,’ with a staggering 80% holding government security clearances. The company’s AI capabilities are not just extensive but also deeply integrated into sensitive areas of national security. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. For those curious souls wanting to delve deeper, check out Booz Allen Hamilton’s Leading AI for the Federal Government portal. If your stars align, you might even consider applying for a job since they’re growing and looking to fill a multitude of positions. What analysts are saying In a February research report, William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma mentioned that the outbreak of multiple wars and the artificial intelligence boom “have led to an inflection in government tech hiring and bookings that we feel has some serious legs.” And also, that Booz Allen “remains the government’s go-to source to modernize the military and prepare for conflicts.” In fact, the company “has more backlog than it can handle as government spending has surged on Pacific tensions and AI prototyping.” Finally, this week (May 21, 2024), Stifel raised its price target for BAH to $170 from $155 (from the chart above that you can't see, BAH was $156.83), keeping a buy rating since “AI, cyber and IT modernization remain in focus for the government.” Besides, there have been recently approved federal budget and supplemental spending packages. According to data from William Blair, the analyst sentiment towards Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) is overwhelmingly positive. Not a single soul is suggesting to sell, which paints a promising picture for our tale. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image with the current rating distribution. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. This table could be important to see. Their aiSSEMBLE solution Just recently — on April 30, 2024 — Booz Allen Hamilton announced the launch of aiSSEMBLE Baseline, a first-of-its-kind, open-source solution built to simplify the engineering and deployment of AI systems. Booz Allen Hamilton boasts that aiSSEMBLE is the core tool cementing its status as the leading AI provider to the U.S. federal government. If that’s the case, it suggests that this new foundational code, complete with open-source documentation and free for use by government, academic, nonprofit, and commercial entities, could further extend Booz Allen’s lead. It can also help them with talent acquisition. By opening the doors to aiSSEMBLE, Booz Allen is inviting a wave of innovation from all corners — government agencies, universities, nonprofits, and private firms — because some bright sparks out there will undoubtedly create remarkable innovations using aiSSEMBLE, catching Booz Allen’s eye in the process. There’s one kink, though… Booz Allen Hamilton’s own top brass sold shares on May 21, 2024. Those actions were filed with the SEC a day before BHA was scheduled to report earnings. There are eight Form-4s. For those not in the know, a Form-4 is a statement of changes in beneficial ownership of securities by company insiders. But wait a second. Let’s dig deeper. All the Form-4s state they first acquired shares through the vesting of performance-based restricted stock units (RSUs). These RSUs are a form of compensation granted to employees, becoming vested and thereby exercisable or transferable based on achieving specific performance criteria over a set period. In other words, they hit a target — they accomplish a goal — and they’re rewarded with stock. The shares they sold are just a part of the shares acquired. For instance, the CEO — Horacio Rozanski — received 71,575 shares, and he decided to sell 34,571. The EVP & Chief Operating Officer Kristine Anderson acquired 7,544 shares and sold 3,644. Not a single one of them decided to sell the farm and run away. Therefore, they might have sold a portion to cover taxes or diversify their portfolios. This is a common practice and doesn’t necessarily reflect a lack of confidence in the company’s future. Besides, the number of shares sold is minimal compared to the total number they still hold. I told you the CEO sold 34,571 shares, but he is still holding 579,025 more. Kristine sold 3,644, but she still has 72,761. In the end, it is not a red flag. But it was a kink I didn’t appreciate, considering they still decided to sell before earnings. Then again, it’s quite plausible that Booz Allen Hamilton’s top brass might be governed by internal clauses dictating when they can sell their vested shares. After all, many companies have strict trading windows and blackout periods to prevent any appearance of insider trading or conflict of interest. Nonetheless, this was one of the two reasons why I only bought a trunk instead of backing up a Freightliner to load up with shares. How my gambit played out Honestly, there's no point in narrating the play on Reddit since I can't add the entry, premarket charts, profit, or any attachments. So... if you care about how I played this, the link is here. One more insight I learned Booz Allen Hamilton and its helmsman, Horacio Rozanski, aren’t clamoring atop the AI hype train, hollering for investors to crown them the new AI darling everyone should own. Make no mistake, they’re an AI powerhouse. It’s just that they’re not focused on selling the sizzle. In the current world, where companies blare out press releases at the faintest whiff of anything AI-related to entice investors, Booz Allen Hamilton — armed with bona fide credentials — opts to toil diligently away from the limelight. Perhaps it’s by design, though. Considering this is a company that lists its fiscal 2024 revenue with most projects cloaked in secrecy. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here with all their classified contracts. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. So what happens now? I’ve already tipped my hand and no longer hold any BAH shares. My play has come and gone. Considering today's pullback, I bought a small number of September and December calls. Now, after reading this essay, could someone consider investing in Booz Allen Hamilton? Maybe. AI is set to grow, the U.S. government is bound to expand its AI use, and this company is already well-positioned to secure more projects. So, why am I not invested in BAH? Because I’m neither an investor nor a position trader. I’m a short-term swing trader. I played this earnings catalyst, made some profit, and then walked away. Granted, after this deep dive, I’ll keep an eye on BAH and might tag along if she sets up for a northward run. But I know my timeframe. I know my trading style and my limitations. Likewise, it’s up to you to know your trading style and decide what to do with this information. Keep in mind, BAH experienced some volatility selling, and the implied volatility dipped post-earnings and guidance. Probably because some who positioned ahead of earnings were expecting a bigger leap. It’s logical to assume some will take their profits (as we saw today), so don't jump blindly. On the flip side, these earnings mostly flew under the radar. Booz Allen Hamilton remains an AI colossus that most retail traders haven’t even heard of. Besides, do you know how many will actually read this and understand the information? At any rate, now you know what I know. Have a great day.",I love these dd’s without positions. 🤦‍♂️ ,0,0.502,0.956,POSITIVE
,"My deep dive on Booz Allen Hamilton’s AI dominance and what it means for traders I'm sharing my research so YOU can make a better decision. I know many members prefer to be told what to buy, but this is an essay, not a BanBet. My current BanBet record is 31-20, which is so-so. But honestly, you should still learn how to trade, not how to shadow. So why should you read this? That's something you have to decide. Read the title. Only you can decide whether it makes sense to find out more about this company, or not. This is the only image I can post here. 🙁 ❗️ TL;DR: Look here, this essay’s got more words than a politician’s promise, and it doesn't even spoon-feeds you a play. Preposterous! If you’re itching to block me, here’s your guide. Now, if the sheer volume of words is giving you the vapors, I don’t blame you. Just look at this behemoth of text. By golly! Let’s face it: you don’t really want to be here, and you’re likely not my audience (folks who actually enjoy reading and/or appreciate knowledge). So, I’d just as soon see you off. Sure, you could go outside and indulge in memes, but I wager you’ve got a primal need to scroll down and leave a gripe about how absurd it is to expect anyone to wade through this verbosity. Well, go ahead. Vent away. Hello. Welcome. You should already know that in today's financial markets, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as the golden prodigy, with investors flocking like bees to honey, eagerly snapping up stocks from those trailblazing companies leading the AI revolution. Amidst this fervor, one company stands as the top purveyor of AI services to the U.S. government. Yet, it remains unknown to the general populace. This essay delves into why Booz Allen Hamilton has earned this position, the significant impact of its AI initiatives, and what this means for traders keen to ride the AI boom. Interested? Keep reading, then. ⚠️ WARNING: I originally wrote this research before Booz Allen Hamilton’s fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 results. Fiscal year, not a calendar year. And I did share my findings with other traders on time. If you are reading this now, that event is already in the past. However, the research is still valid, so I’m posting it here. ⚠️ DISCLAIMER: In their diaphanous wisdom, Reddit/Mods have decreed that posts be limited to a single attachment, which I’ve already used. This essay is adorned with several images to enhance its appeal and, more crucially, includes numerous charts, which I am regrettably unable to include here. If you wish to peruse the full essay with all its illustrative charts, here’s the link. You can continue reading it here on WSB, but be forewarned—you’ll miss out on the visual aids that bring the data to life. The choice, dear reader, is yours. Well now, picture this: The clock has just struck midnight, and today — Friday, May 24, 2024 — has only begun to stretch its legs. I literally just mentioned that I originally wrote this research before Booz Allen Hamilton’s fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 results. Just a few hours ago, I went and bought myself a trunk full of Booz Allen Hamilton shares. And wouldn’t you know it, in just a handful of hours, that very company is set to unveil their earnings report, promising a significant move in the stock, one way or another. Again, I wrote this last week before the earnings. I leaped into this play guided by my trader’s intuition. Now, as I burn the midnight oil, I’m digging into the logic and facts behind that decision. I figured, heck, why not pen an essay about the things I uncover along the way? the number one provider of artificial intelligence (AI) services to the U.S. government. A bit of history Booz Allen Hamilton is no hip upstart. Nope. This institution was founded way back in 1914 by one Edwin G. Booz in the bustling city of Chicago, offering management consulting services before it was even fashionable. During the 1940s, it played a pivotal role in World War II, aiding the U.S. military in improving efficiency and logistics. A decade later, the firm found a niche working with U.S. defense contracts, cementing its reputation as a trusted advisor to Uncle Sam. So why focus on a company named like a law firm? Well, according to GovWin from Deltek — a leading market intelligence organization — Booz Allen is the number one provider of artificial intelligence (AI) services to the U.S. government. And unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’d know that the market currently embraces anything related to artificial intelligence with open arms and a hearty cheer. AI is the belle of the ball. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. For perspective, exactly one year ago (May 24, 2023), NVIDIA had a market capitalization of $760.2 billion. Today, she’s valued at $2.55 trillion. Why? It’s largely due to the insatiably high demand for its AI chips, which are essential for powering advanced AI applications. A reliable uptrend Booz Allen Hamilton boasts a legacy spanning over a century — they consider it 110 years young — but it wasn’t until 2010 that it opened its doors to public investors, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BAH. And if we take a gander at the company’s story as told by its yearly chart, from a humble low of $11.85 in 2012, Booz Allen has steadily climbed the ladder of success, closing today — or yesterday — at $156.83. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Historical yearly performance of Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) stock) here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. That’s a 1,224% ascent, with only a single slightly red year in between, marring the record in 2021. That’s quite the tale of endurance and growth, wouldn’t you say? Aren’t we late to the party, though? Well, Booz Allen Hamilton’s current market capitalization stands at a tidy $20 billion. It’s nothing to scoff at, mind you, but to put things in perspective, this ranks Booz Allen as the 955th most valuable company. There’s still plenty of rungs left to climb on the ladder and ample room for growth down the road. A significant catalyst I’m sharing a monthly chart. Generally speaking, BAH was meandering sideways for nearly three years.

However, the research is still valid, so I’m posting it here. ⚠️ DISCLAIMER: In their diaphanous wisdom, Reddit/Mods have decreed that posts be limited to a single attachment, which I’ve already used. This essay is adorned with several images to enhance its appeal and, more crucially, includes numerous charts, which I am regrettably unable to include here. If you wish to peruse the full essay with all its illustrative charts, here’s the link. You can continue reading it here on WSB, but be forewarned—you’ll miss out on the visual aids that bring the data to life. The choice, dear reader, is yours. Well now, picture this: The clock has just struck midnight, and today — Friday, May 24, 2024 — has only begun to stretch its legs. I literally just mentioned that I originally wrote this research before Booz Allen Hamilton’s fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 results. Just a few hours ago, I went and bought myself a trunk full of Booz Allen Hamilton shares. And wouldn’t you know it, in just a handful of hours, that very company is set to unveil their earnings report, promising a significant move in the stock, one way or another. Again, I wrote this last week before the earnings. I leaped into this play guided by my trader’s intuition. Now, as I burn the midnight oil, I’m digging into the logic and facts behind that decision. I figured, heck, why not pen an essay about the things I uncover along the way? the number one provider of artificial intelligence (AI) services to the U.S. government. A bit of history Booz Allen Hamilton is no hip upstart. Nope. This institution was founded way back in 1914 by one Edwin G. Booz in the bustling city of Chicago, offering management consulting services before it was even fashionable. During the 1940s, it played a pivotal role in World War II, aiding the U.S. military in improving efficiency and logistics. A decade later, the firm found a niche working with U.S. defense contracts, cementing its reputation as a trusted advisor to Uncle Sam. So why focus on a company named like a law firm? Well, according to GovWin from Deltek — a leading market intelligence organization — Booz Allen is the number one provider of artificial intelligence (AI) services to the U.S. government. And unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’d know that the market currently embraces anything related to artificial intelligence with open arms and a hearty cheer. AI is the belle of the ball. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. For perspective, exactly one year ago (May 24, 2023), NVIDIA had a market capitalization of $760.2 billion. Today, she’s valued at $2.55 trillion. Why? It’s largely due to the insatiably high demand for its AI chips, which are essential for powering advanced AI applications. A reliable uptrend Booz Allen Hamilton boasts a legacy spanning over a century — they consider it 110 years young — but it wasn’t until 2010 that it opened its doors to public investors, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BAH. And if we take a gander at the company’s story as told by its yearly chart, from a humble low of $11.85 in 2012, Booz Allen has steadily climbed the ladder of success, closing today — or yesterday — at $156.83. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Historical yearly performance of Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) stock) here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. That’s a 1,224% ascent, with only a single slightly red year in between, marring the record in 2021. That’s quite the tale of endurance and growth, wouldn’t you say? Aren’t we late to the party, though? Well, Booz Allen Hamilton’s current market capitalization stands at a tidy $20 billion. It’s nothing to scoff at, mind you, but to put things in perspective, this ranks Booz Allen as the 955th most valuable company. There’s still plenty of rungs left to climb on the ladder and ample room for growth down the road. A significant catalyst I’m sharing a monthly chart. Generally speaking, BAH was meandering sideways for nearly three years. That is, until a year ago, on May 26, 2023, to be precise. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Monthly performance of Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) stock. The price level illustrates a resistance/support level between August 2020 and May 2023.) here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. Following that earnings report, the stock kicked up her heels and went on a 38% run over the next two months. Also, aside from better-than-expected earnings, Booz Allen Hamilton was awarded a $919 million Engineering, Development, Integration, and Technology-based Solutions (EDITS) contract. The contract supports the “Soldier as a System” concept, enhancing warfighter capabilities across multiple Department of Defense (DoD) agencies. The EDITS program promotes collaboration across service boundaries and aims to modernize and equip military tactical units, improving lethality, survivability, and situational awareness. Look at the competition Hold your horses. It’s not just one contract or one project propelling Booz Allen Hamilton skyward. The tide of AI is lifting all boats, so it’s not just one company sailing full steam ahead. Granted, Booz Allen offers a smorgasbord of services, thus facing several competitors in various fields. However, if we narrow our focus to the AI sector, some of the most direct competitors are: Leidos Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: LDOS) Leidos provides AI and machine learning solutions to various U.S. government agencies, including the Department of Defense (DoD). Their AI capabilities are integrated into solutions for cybersecurity, data analysis, and operational efficiency in defense and intelligence operations. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Daily performance of Leidos Holdings (LDOS) stock.

As you can see, when earnings roll around, these companies tend to pop and set off on a run northward, much like a hound hot on the trail. Each earnings report can become a potential catalyst, sparking a surge in investor enthusiasm and sending stock prices climbing. That’s what I’m playing. What I played. ----- Other high-profile projects Booz Allen Hamilton is involved in several high-profile projects that leverage AI. Some notable projects include: Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) Booz Allen supports the U.S. Department of Defense’s CJADC2 initiative alongside L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: LHX), which aims to integrate sensors, data, and weapon systems across all military domains — land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace — using AI and machine learning to enhance situational awareness and decision-making capabilities. Project Maven Booz Allen has been a key contractor in Project Maven, an AI program initiated by the Department of Defense, which among other things, aims to analyze video footage from drones using machine learning algorithms to identify objects and patterns, significantly improving intelligence and surveillance operations. Project Linchpin It is the U.S. Army’s first program of record providing an artificial intelligence operations pipeline. It is currently just a $2 million contract to support research and development, but it is anticipated to be followed by subsequent juicier contracts. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. Satellites Booz Allen also made a strategic investment in Albedo, the first company to operate satellites in very low Earth orbit (VLEO), which enables them to offer ultra-high resolution commercial imagery from space. Let’s take a moment to chill because it’s not all black ops and military projects. U.S. Department of Energy On March 12, 2024, Booz Allen Hamilton announced it was awarded a ten-year $550 million contract from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) to support the advancement of high-potential, high-impact, early-stage technologies that generate, store, and use energy in entirely new ways to reduce U.S. emissions, improve energy efficiency, and increase the resiliency and reliability of the U.S. power grid. To give you an idea, ARPA-E is tasked with identifying, shepherding, and accelerating “…the stuff that sounds crazy until it changes the world.” U.S. Environmental Protection Agency On May 8, 2024, the company announced it was awarded a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) to support the agency’s modernization efforts and its mission to protect human health and the environment. Booz Allen won one of four positions on the seven-year Scientific Modeling, Application, Visualization, Computational Science, Software, and Statistical Support (SMAVCS4) BPA, which has a ceiling of $431 million. And many more Booz Allen has nearly 200 active AI projects across defense, national security, and civil missions — including three of the largest AI contracts within the Department of Defense. Understandably, many of them are top secret. 🤐 Late last year, an analyst noted that 2,200 BAH employees are considered ‘AI staff,’ with a staggering 80% holding government security clearances. The company’s AI capabilities are not just extensive but also deeply integrated into sensitive areas of national security. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. For those curious souls wanting to delve deeper, check out Booz Allen Hamilton’s Leading AI for the Federal Government portal. If your stars align, you might even consider applying for a job since they’re growing and looking to fill a multitude of positions. What analysts are saying In a February research report, William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma mentioned that the outbreak of multiple wars and the artificial intelligence boom “have led to an inflection in government tech hiring and bookings that we feel has some serious legs.” And also, that Booz Allen “remains the government’s go-to source to modernize the military and prepare for conflicts.” In fact, the company “has more backlog than it can handle as government spending has surged on Pacific tensions and AI prototyping.” Finally, this week (May 21, 2024), Stifel raised its price target for BAH to $170 from $155 (from the chart above that you can't see, BAH was $156.83), keeping a buy rating since “AI, cyber and IT modernization remain in focus for the government.” Besides, there have been recently approved federal budget and supplemental spending packages. According to data from William Blair, the analyst sentiment towards Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) is overwhelmingly positive. Not a single soul is suggesting to sell, which paints a promising picture for our tale. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image with the current rating distribution. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. This table could be important to see. Their aiSSEMBLE solution Just recently — on April 30, 2024 — Booz Allen Hamilton announced the launch of aiSSEMBLE Baseline, a first-of-its-kind, open-source solution built to simplify the engineering and deployment of AI systems. Booz Allen Hamilton boasts that aiSSEMBLE is the core tool cementing its status as the leading AI provider to the U.S. federal government. If that’s the case, it suggests that this new foundational code, complete with open-source documentation and free for use by government, academic, nonprofit, and commercial entities, could further extend Booz Allen’s lead. It can also help them with talent acquisition. By opening the doors to aiSSEMBLE, Booz Allen is inviting a wave of innovation from all corners — government agencies, universities, nonprofits, and private firms — because some bright sparks out there will undoubtedly create remarkable innovations using aiSSEMBLE, catching Booz Allen’s eye in the process. There’s one kink, though… Booz Allen Hamilton’s own top brass sold shares on May 21, 2024. Those actions were filed with the SEC a day before BHA was scheduled to report earnings. There are eight Form-4s. For those not in the know, a Form-4 is a statement of changes in beneficial ownership of securities by company insiders. But wait a second. Let’s dig deeper. All the Form-4s state they first acquired shares through the vesting of performance-based restricted stock units (RSUs). These RSUs are a form of compensation granted to employees, becoming vested and thereby exercisable or transferable based on achieving specific performance criteria over a set period. In other words, they hit a target — they accomplish a goal — and they’re rewarded with stock. The shares they sold are just a part of the shares acquired. For instance, the CEO — Horacio Rozanski — received 71,575 shares, and he decided to sell 34,571. The EVP & Chief Operating Officer Kristine Anderson acquired 7,544 shares and sold 3,644. Not a single one of them decided to sell the farm and run away. Therefore, they might have sold a portion to cover taxes or diversify their portfolios. This is a common practice and doesn’t necessarily reflect a lack of confidence in the company’s future. Besides, the number of shares sold is minimal compared to the total number they still hold. I told you the CEO sold 34,571 shares, but he is still holding 579,025 more. Kristine sold 3,644, but she still has 72,761. In the end, it is not a red flag. But it was a kink I didn’t appreciate, considering they still decided to sell before earnings. Then again, it’s quite plausible that Booz Allen Hamilton’s top brass might be governed by internal clauses dictating when they can sell their vested shares. After all, many companies have strict trading windows and blackout periods to prevent any appearance of insider trading or conflict of interest. Nonetheless, this was one of the two reasons why I only bought a trunk instead of backing up a Freightliner to load up with shares. How my gambit played out Honestly, there's no point in narrating the play on Reddit since I can't add the entry, premarket charts, profit, or any attachments. So... if you care about how I played this, the link is here. One more insight I learned Booz Allen Hamilton and its helmsman, Horacio Rozanski, aren’t clamoring atop the AI hype train, hollering for investors to crown them the new AI darling everyone should own. Make no mistake, they’re an AI powerhouse. It’s just that they’re not focused on selling the sizzle. In the current world, where companies blare out press releases at the faintest whiff of anything AI-related to entice investors, Booz Allen Hamilton — armed with bona fide credentials — opts to toil diligently away from the limelight. Perhaps it’s by design, though. Considering this is a company that lists its fiscal 2024 revenue with most projects cloaked in secrecy. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here with all their classified contracts. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. So what happens now? I’ve already tipped my hand and no longer hold any BAH shares. My play has come and gone. Considering today's pullback, I bought a small number of September and December calls. Now, after reading this essay, could someone consider investing in Booz Allen Hamilton? Maybe. AI is set to grow, the U.S. government is bound to expand its AI use, and this company is already well-positioned to secure more projects. So, why am I not invested in BAH? Because I’m neither an investor nor a position trader. I’m a short-term swing trader. I played this earnings catalyst, made some profit, and then walked away. Granted, after this deep dive, I’ll keep an eye on BAH and might tag along if she sets up for a northward run. But I know my timeframe. I know my trading style and my limitations. Likewise, it’s up to you to know your trading style and decide what to do with this information. Keep in mind, BAH experienced some volatility selling, and the implied volatility dipped post-earnings and guidance. Probably because some who positioned ahead of earnings were expecting a bigger leap. It’s logical to assume some will take their profits (as we saw today), so don't jump blindly. On the flip side, these earnings mostly flew under the radar. Booz Allen Hamilton remains an AI colossus that most retail traders haven’t even heard of. Besides, do you know how many will actually read this and understand the information? At any rate, now you know what I know. Have a great day.",Oh its at the top. Dont put it at the top.

,"My deep dive on Booz Allen Hamilton’s AI dominance and what it means for traders I'm sharing my research so YOU can make a better decision. I know many members prefer to be told what to buy, but this is an essay, not a BanBet. My current BanBet record is 31-20, which is so-so. But honestly, you should still learn how to trade, not how to shadow. So why should you read this? That's something you have to decide. Read the title. Only you can decide whether it makes sense to find out more about this company, or not. This is the only image I can post here. 🙁 ❗️ TL;DR: Look here, this essay’s got more words than a politician’s promise, and it doesn't even spoon-feeds you a play. Preposterous! If you’re itching to block me, here’s your guide. Now, if the sheer volume of words is giving you the vapors, I don’t blame you. Just look at this behemoth of text. By golly! Let’s face it: you don’t really want to be here, and you’re likely not my audience (folks who actually enjoy reading and/or appreciate knowledge). So, I’d just as soon see you off. Sure, you could go outside and indulge in memes, but I wager you’ve got a primal need to scroll down and leave a gripe about how absurd it is to expect anyone to wade through this verbosity. Well, go ahead. Vent away. Hello. Welcome. You should already know that in today's financial markets, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as the golden prodigy, with investors flocking like bees to honey, eagerly snapping up stocks from those trailblazing companies leading the AI revolution. Amidst this fervor, one company stands as the top purveyor of AI services to the U.S. government. Yet, it remains unknown to the general populace. This essay delves into why Booz Allen Hamilton has earned this position, the significant impact of its AI initiatives, and what this means for traders keen to ride the AI boom. Interested?

After all, many companies have strict trading windows and blackout periods to prevent any appearance of insider trading or conflict of interest. Nonetheless, this was one of the two reasons why I only bought a trunk instead of backing up a Freightliner to load up with shares. How my gambit played out Honestly, there's no point in narrating the play on Reddit since I can't add the entry, premarket charts, profit, or any attachments. So... if you care about how I played this, the link is here. One more insight I learned Booz Allen Hamilton and its helmsman, Horacio Rozanski, aren’t clamoring atop the AI hype train, hollering for investors to crown them the new AI darling everyone should own. Make no mistake, they’re an AI powerhouse. It’s just that they’re not focused on selling the sizzle. In the current world, where companies blare out press releases at the faintest whiff of anything AI-related to entice investors, Booz Allen Hamilton — armed with bona fide credentials — opts to toil diligently away from the limelight. Perhaps it’s by design, though. Considering this is a company that lists its fiscal 2024 revenue with most projects cloaked in secrecy. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here with all their classified contracts. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. So what happens now? I’ve already tipped my hand and no longer hold any BAH shares. My play has come and gone. Considering today's pullback, I bought a small number of September and December calls. Now, after reading this essay, could someone consider investing in Booz Allen Hamilton? Maybe. AI is set to grow, the U.S. government is bound to expand its AI use, and this company is already well-positioned to secure more projects. So, why am I not invested in BAH? Because I’m neither an investor nor a position trader. I’m a short-term swing trader. I played this earnings catalyst, made some profit, and then walked away. Granted, after this deep dive, I’ll keep an eye on BAH and might tag along if she sets up for a northward run. But I know my timeframe. I know my trading style and my limitations. Likewise, it’s up to you to know your trading style and decide what to do with this information. Keep in mind, BAH experienced some volatility selling, and the implied volatility dipped post-earnings and guidance. Probably because some who positioned ahead of earnings were expecting a bigger leap. It’s logical to assume some will take their profits (as we saw today), so don't jump blindly. On the flip side, these earnings mostly flew under the radar. Booz Allen Hamilton remains an AI colossus that most retail traders haven’t even heard of. Besides, do you know how many will actually read this and understand the information? At any rate, now you know what I know. Have a great day.",so nvda calls it is,0,0.512,0.896,NEGATIVE
,"My deep dive on Booz Allen Hamilton’s AI dominance and what it means for traders I'm sharing my research so YOU can make a better decision. I know many members prefer to be told what to buy, but this is an essay, not a BanBet. My current BanBet record is 31-20, which is so-so. But honestly, you should still learn how to trade, not how to shadow. So why should you read this? That's something you have to decide. Read the title. Only you can decide whether it makes sense to find out more about this company, or not. This is the only image I can post here. 🙁 ❗️ TL;DR: Look here, this essay’s got more words than a politician’s promise, and it doesn't even spoon-feeds you a play. Preposterous! If you’re itching to block me, here’s your guide. Now, if the sheer volume of words is giving you the vapors, I don’t blame you. Just look at this behemoth of text. By golly! Let’s face it: you don’t really want to be here, and you’re likely not my audience (folks who actually enjoy reading and/or appreciate knowledge). So, I’d just as soon see you off. Sure, you could go outside and indulge in memes, but I wager you’ve got a primal need to scroll down and leave a gripe about how absurd it is to expect anyone to wade through this verbosity. Well, go ahead. Vent away. Hello. Welcome. You should already know that in today's financial markets, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as the golden prodigy, with investors flocking like bees to honey, eagerly snapping up stocks from those trailblazing companies leading the AI revolution. Amidst this fervor, one company stands as the top purveyor of AI services to the U.S. government. Yet, it remains unknown to the general populace. This essay delves into why Booz Allen Hamilton has earned this position, the significant impact of its AI initiatives, and what this means for traders keen to ride the AI boom. Interested? Keep reading, then. ⚠️ WARNING: I originally wrote this research before Booz Allen Hamilton’s fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 results. Fiscal year, not a calendar year. And I did share my findings with other traders on time. If you are reading this now, that event is already in the past. However, the research is still valid, so I’m posting it here. ⚠️ DISCLAIMER: In their diaphanous wisdom, Reddit/Mods have decreed that posts be limited to a single attachment, which I’ve already used. This essay is adorned with several images to enhance its appeal and, more crucially, includes numerous charts, which I am regrettably unable to include here. If you wish to peruse the full essay with all its illustrative charts, here’s the link. You can continue reading it here on WSB, but be forewarned—you’ll miss out on the visual aids that bring the data to life. The choice, dear reader, is yours. Well now, picture this: The clock has just struck midnight, and today — Friday, May 24, 2024 — has only begun to stretch its legs. I literally just mentioned that I originally wrote this research before Booz Allen Hamilton’s fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 results. Just a few hours ago, I went and bought myself a trunk full of Booz Allen Hamilton shares. And wouldn’t you know it, in just a handful of hours, that very company is set to unveil their earnings report, promising a significant move in the stock, one way or another. Again, I wrote this last week before the earnings. I leaped into this play guided by my trader’s intuition. Now, as I burn the midnight oil, I’m digging into the logic and facts behind that decision. I figured, heck, why not pen an essay about the things I uncover along the way? the number one provider of artificial intelligence (AI) services to the U.S. government. A bit of history Booz Allen Hamilton is no hip upstart. Nope. This institution was founded way back in 1914 by one Edwin G. Booz in the bustling city of Chicago, offering management consulting services before it was even fashionable. During the 1940s, it played a pivotal role in World War II, aiding the U.S. military in improving efficiency and logistics. A decade later, the firm found a niche working with U.S. defense contracts, cementing its reputation as a trusted advisor to Uncle Sam. So why focus on a company named like a law firm? Well, according to GovWin from Deltek — a leading market intelligence organization — Booz Allen is the number one provider of artificial intelligence (AI) services to the U.S. government. And unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’d know that the market currently embraces anything related to artificial intelligence with open arms and a hearty cheer. AI is the belle of the ball. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. For perspective, exactly one year ago (May 24, 2023), NVIDIA had a market capitalization of $760.2 billion. Today, she’s valued at $2.55 trillion. Why? It’s largely due to the insatiably high demand for its AI chips, which are essential for powering advanced AI applications. A reliable uptrend Booz Allen Hamilton boasts a legacy spanning over a century — they consider it 110 years young — but it wasn’t until 2010 that it opened its doors to public investors, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BAH. And if we take a gander at the company’s story as told by its yearly chart, from a humble low of $11.85 in 2012, Booz Allen has steadily climbed the ladder of success, closing today — or yesterday — at $156.83. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Historical yearly performance of Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) stock) here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. That’s a 1,224% ascent, with only a single slightly red year in between, marring the record in 2021. That’s quite the tale of endurance and growth, wouldn’t you say? Aren’t we late to the party, though? Well, Booz Allen Hamilton’s current market capitalization stands at a tidy $20 billion. It’s nothing to scoff at, mind you, but to put things in perspective, this ranks Booz Allen as the 955th most valuable company. There’s still plenty of rungs left to climb on the ladder and ample room for growth down the road. A significant catalyst I’m sharing a monthly chart. Generally speaking, BAH was meandering sideways for nearly three years. That is, until a year ago, on May 26, 2023, to be precise. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Monthly performance of Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) stock. The price level illustrates a resistance/support level between August 2020 and May 2023.) here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. Following that earnings report, the stock kicked up her heels and went on a 38% run over the next two months. Also, aside from better-than-expected earnings, Booz Allen Hamilton was awarded a $919 million Engineering, Development, Integration, and Technology-based Solutions (EDITS) contract. The contract supports the “Soldier as a System” concept, enhancing warfighter capabilities across multiple Department of Defense (DoD) agencies. The EDITS program promotes collaboration across service boundaries and aims to modernize and equip military tactical units, improving lethality, survivability, and situational awareness. Look at the competition Hold your horses. It’s not just one contract or one project propelling Booz Allen Hamilton skyward. The tide of AI is lifting all boats, so it’s not just one company sailing full steam ahead. Granted, Booz Allen offers a smorgasbord of services, thus facing several competitors in various fields. However, if we narrow our focus to the AI sector, some of the most direct competitors are: Leidos Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: LDOS) Leidos provides AI and machine learning solutions to various U.S. government agencies, including the Department of Defense (DoD). Their AI capabilities are integrated into solutions for cybersecurity, data analysis, and operational efficiency in defense and intelligence operations. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Daily performance of Leidos Holdings (LDOS) stock.

As you can see, when earnings roll around, these companies tend to pop and set off on a run northward, much like a hound hot on the trail. Each earnings report can become a potential catalyst, sparking a surge in investor enthusiasm and sending stock prices climbing. That’s what I’m playing. What I played. ----- Other high-profile projects Booz Allen Hamilton is involved in several high-profile projects that leverage AI. Some notable projects include: Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) Booz Allen supports the U.S. Department of Defense’s CJADC2 initiative alongside L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: LHX), which aims to integrate sensors, data, and weapon systems across all military domains — land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace — using AI and machine learning to enhance situational awareness and decision-making capabilities. Project Maven Booz Allen has been a key contractor in Project Maven, an AI program initiated by the Department of Defense, which among other things, aims to analyze video footage from drones using machine learning algorithms to identify objects and patterns, significantly improving intelligence and surveillance operations. Project Linchpin It is the U.S. Army’s first program of record providing an artificial intelligence operations pipeline. It is currently just a $2 million contract to support research and development, but it is anticipated to be followed by subsequent juicier contracts. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. Satellites Booz Allen also made a strategic investment in Albedo, the first company to operate satellites in very low Earth orbit (VLEO), which enables them to offer ultra-high resolution commercial imagery from space. Let’s take a moment to chill because it’s not all black ops and military projects. U.S. Department of Energy On March 12, 2024, Booz Allen Hamilton announced it was awarded a ten-year $550 million contract from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) to support the advancement of high-potential, high-impact, early-stage technologies that generate, store, and use energy in entirely new ways to reduce U.S. emissions, improve energy efficiency, and increase the resiliency and reliability of the U.S. power grid. To give you an idea, ARPA-E is tasked with identifying, shepherding, and accelerating “…the stuff that sounds crazy until it changes the world.” U.S. Environmental Protection Agency On May 8, 2024, the company announced it was awarded a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) to support the agency’s modernization efforts and its mission to protect human health and the environment. Booz Allen won one of four positions on the seven-year Scientific Modeling, Application, Visualization, Computational Science, Software, and Statistical Support (SMAVCS4) BPA, which has a ceiling of $431 million. And many more Booz Allen has nearly 200 active AI projects across defense, national security, and civil missions — including three of the largest AI contracts within the Department of Defense. Understandably, many of them are top secret. 🤐 Late last year, an analyst noted that 2,200 BAH employees are considered ‘AI staff,’ with a staggering 80% holding government security clearances. The company’s AI capabilities are not just extensive but also deeply integrated into sensitive areas of national security. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here.

If your stars align, you might even consider applying for a job since they’re growing and looking to fill a multitude of positions. What analysts are saying In a February research report, William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma mentioned that the outbreak of multiple wars and the artificial intelligence boom “have led to an inflection in government tech hiring and bookings that we feel has some serious legs.” And also, that Booz Allen “remains the government’s go-to source to modernize the military and prepare for conflicts.” In fact, the company “has more backlog than it can handle as government spending has surged on Pacific tensions and AI prototyping.” Finally, this week (May 21, 2024), Stifel raised its price target for BAH to $170 from $155 (from the chart above that you can't see, BAH was $156.83), keeping a buy rating since “AI, cyber and IT modernization remain in focus for the government.” Besides, there have been recently approved federal budget and supplemental spending packages. According to data from William Blair, the analyst sentiment towards Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) is overwhelmingly positive. Not a single soul is suggesting to sell, which paints a promising picture for our tale. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image with the current rating distribution. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. This table could be important to see. Their aiSSEMBLE solution Just recently — on April 30, 2024 — Booz Allen Hamilton announced the launch of aiSSEMBLE Baseline, a first-of-its-kind, open-source solution built to simplify the engineering and deployment of AI systems. Booz Allen Hamilton boasts that aiSSEMBLE is the core tool cementing its status as the leading AI provider to the U.S. federal government. If that’s the case, it suggests that this new foundational code, complete with open-source documentation and free for use by government, academic, nonprofit, and commercial entities, could further extend Booz Allen’s lead. It can also help them with talent acquisition. By opening the doors to aiSSEMBLE, Booz Allen is inviting a wave of innovation from all corners — government agencies, universities, nonprofits, and private firms — because some bright sparks out there will undoubtedly create remarkable innovations using aiSSEMBLE, catching Booz Allen’s eye in the process. There’s one kink, though… Booz Allen Hamilton’s own top brass sold shares on May 21, 2024. Those actions were filed with the SEC a day before BHA was scheduled to report earnings. There are eight Form-4s. For those not in the know, a Form-4 is a statement of changes in beneficial ownership of securities by company insiders. But wait a second. Let’s dig deeper. All the Form-4s state they first acquired shares through the vesting of performance-based restricted stock units (RSUs). These RSUs are a form of compensation granted to employees, becoming vested and thereby exercisable or transferable based on achieving specific performance criteria over a set period. In other words, they hit a target — they accomplish a goal — and they’re rewarded with stock. The shares they sold are just a part of the shares acquired. For instance, the CEO — Horacio Rozanski — received 71,575 shares, and he decided to sell 34,571. The EVP & Chief Operating Officer Kristine Anderson acquired 7,544 shares and sold 3,644. Not a single one of them decided to sell the farm and run away. Therefore, they might have sold a portion to cover taxes or diversify their portfolios. This is a common practice and doesn’t necessarily reflect a lack of confidence in the company’s future. Besides, the number of shares sold is minimal compared to the total number they still hold. I told you the CEO sold 34,571 shares, but he is still holding 579,025 more. Kristine sold 3,644, but she still has 72,761. In the end, it is not a red flag. But it was a kink I didn’t appreciate, considering they still decided to sell before earnings. Then again, it’s quite plausible that Booz Allen Hamilton’s top brass might be governed by internal clauses dictating when they can sell their vested shares. After all, many companies have strict trading windows and blackout periods to prevent any appearance of insider trading or conflict of interest. Nonetheless, this was one of the two reasons why I only bought a trunk instead of backing up a Freightliner to load up with shares.

Booz Allen won one of four positions on the seven-year Scientific Modeling, Application, Visualization, Computational Science, Software, and Statistical Support (SMAVCS4) BPA, which has a ceiling of $431 million. And many more Booz Allen has nearly 200 active AI projects across defense, national security, and civil missions — including three of the largest AI contracts within the Department of Defense. Understandably, many of them are top secret. 🤐 Late last year, an analyst noted that 2,200 BAH employees are considered ‘AI staff,’ with a staggering 80% holding government security clearances. The company’s AI capabilities are not just extensive but also deeply integrated into sensitive areas of national security. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here.

If your stars align, you might even consider applying for a job since they’re growing and looking to fill a multitude of positions. What analysts are saying In a February research report, William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma mentioned that the outbreak of multiple wars and the artificial intelligence boom “have led to an inflection in government tech hiring and bookings that we feel has some serious legs.” And also, that Booz Allen “remains the government’s go-to source to modernize the military and prepare for conflicts.” In fact, the company “has more backlog than it can handle as government spending has surged on Pacific tensions and AI prototyping.” Finally, this week (May 21, 2024), Stifel raised its price target for BAH to $170 from $155 (from the chart above that you can't see, BAH was $156.83), keeping a buy rating since “AI, cyber and IT modernization remain in focus for the government.” Besides, there have been recently approved federal budget and supplemental spending packages. According to data from William Blair, the analyst sentiment towards Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) is overwhelmingly positive. Not a single soul is suggesting to sell, which paints a promising picture for our tale. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image with the current rating distribution. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. This table could be important to see. Their aiSSEMBLE solution Just recently — on April 30, 2024 — Booz Allen Hamilton announced the launch of aiSSEMBLE Baseline, a first-of-its-kind, open-source solution built to simplify the engineering and deployment of AI systems. Booz Allen Hamilton boasts that aiSSEMBLE is the core tool cementing its status as the leading AI provider to the U.S. federal government. If that’s the case, it suggests that this new foundational code, complete with open-source documentation and free for use by government, academic, nonprofit, and commercial entities, could further extend Booz Allen’s lead. It can also help them with talent acquisition. By opening the doors to aiSSEMBLE, Booz Allen is inviting a wave of innovation from all corners — government agencies, universities, nonprofits, and private firms — because some bright sparks out there will undoubtedly create remarkable innovations using aiSSEMBLE, catching Booz Allen’s eye in the process. There’s one kink, though… Booz Allen Hamilton’s own top brass sold shares on May 21, 2024. Those actions were filed with the SEC a day before BHA was scheduled to report earnings. There are eight Form-4s. For those not in the know, a Form-4 is a statement of changes in beneficial ownership of securities by company insiders. But wait a second. Let’s dig deeper. All the Form-4s state they first acquired shares through the vesting of performance-based restricted stock units (RSUs). These RSUs are a form of compensation granted to employees, becoming vested and thereby exercisable or transferable based on achieving specific performance criteria over a set period. In other words, they hit a target — they accomplish a goal — and they’re rewarded with stock. The shares they sold are just a part of the shares acquired. For instance, the CEO — Horacio Rozanski — received 71,575 shares, and he decided to sell 34,571. The EVP & Chief Operating Officer Kristine Anderson acquired 7,544 shares and sold 3,644. Not a single one of them decided to sell the farm and run away. Therefore, they might have sold a portion to cover taxes or diversify their portfolios. This is a common practice and doesn’t necessarily reflect a lack of confidence in the company’s future. Besides, the number of shares sold is minimal compared to the total number they still hold. I told you the CEO sold 34,571 shares, but he is still holding 579,025 more. Kristine sold 3,644, but she still has 72,761. In the end, it is not a red flag. But it was a kink I didn’t appreciate, considering they still decided to sell before earnings. Then again, it’s quite plausible that Booz Allen Hamilton’s top brass might be governed by internal clauses dictating when they can sell their vested shares. After all, many companies have strict trading windows and blackout periods to prevent any appearance of insider trading or conflict of interest. Nonetheless, this was one of the two reasons why I only bought a trunk instead of backing up a Freightliner to load up with shares. How my gambit played out Honestly, there's no point in narrating the play on Reddit since I can't add the entry, premarket charts, profit, or any attachments. So... if you care about how I played this, the link is here. One more insight I learned Booz Allen Hamilton and its helmsman, Horacio Rozanski, aren’t clamoring atop the AI hype train, hollering for investors to crown them the new AI darling everyone should own. Make no mistake, they’re an AI powerhouse. It’s just that they’re not focused on selling the sizzle. In the current world, where companies blare out press releases at the faintest whiff of anything AI-related to entice investors, Booz Allen Hamilton — armed with bona fide credentials — opts to toil diligently away from the limelight. Perhaps it’s by design, though. Considering this is a company that lists its fiscal 2024 revenue with most projects cloaked in secrecy. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here with all their classified contracts. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. So what happens now? I’ve already tipped my hand and no longer hold any BAH shares. My play has come and gone. Considering today's pullback, I bought a small number of September and December calls. Now, after reading this essay, could someone consider investing in Booz Allen Hamilton? Maybe. AI is set to grow, the U.S. government is bound to expand its AI use, and this company is already well-positioned to secure more projects. So, why am I not invested in BAH? Because I’m neither an investor nor a position trader. I’m a short-term swing trader. I played this earnings catalyst, made some profit, and then walked away. Granted, after this deep dive, I’ll keep an eye on BAH and might tag along if she sets up for a northward run. But I know my timeframe. I know my trading style and my limitations. Likewise, it’s up to you to know your trading style and decide what to do with this information. Keep in mind, BAH experienced some volatility selling, and the implied volatility dipped post-earnings and guidance. Probably because some who positioned ahead of earnings were expecting a bigger leap. It’s logical to assume some will take their profits (as we saw today), so don't jump blindly. On the flip side, these earnings mostly flew under the radar. Booz Allen Hamilton remains an AI colossus that most retail traders haven’t even heard of. Besides, do you know how many will actually read this and understand the information? At any rate, now you know what I know. Have a great day.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,0.999,NEGATIVE
,"My deep dive on Booz Allen Hamilton’s AI dominance and what it means for traders I'm sharing my research so YOU can make a better decision. I know many members prefer to be told what to buy, but this is an essay, not a BanBet. My current BanBet record is 31-20, which is so-so. But honestly, you should still learn how to trade, not how to shadow. So why should you read this? That's something you have to decide. Read the title. Only you can decide whether it makes sense to find out more about this company, or not. This is the only image I can post here. 🙁 ❗️ TL;DR: Look here, this essay’s got more words than a politician’s promise, and it doesn't even spoon-feeds you a play. Preposterous! If you’re itching to block me, here’s your guide. Now, if the sheer volume of words is giving you the vapors, I don’t blame you. Just look at this behemoth of text. By golly! Let’s face it: you don’t really want to be here, and you’re likely not my audience (folks who actually enjoy reading and/or appreciate knowledge). So, I’d just as soon see you off.

Well, go ahead. Vent away. Hello. Welcome. You should already know that in today's financial markets, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as the golden prodigy, with investors flocking like bees to honey, eagerly snapping up stocks from those trailblazing companies leading the AI revolution. Amidst this fervor, one company stands as the top purveyor of AI services to the U.S. government. Yet, it remains unknown to the general populace. This essay delves into why Booz Allen Hamilton has earned this position, the significant impact of its AI initiatives, and what this means for traders keen to ride the AI boom. Interested? Keep reading, then. ⚠️ WARNING: I originally wrote this research before Booz Allen Hamilton’s fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 results. Fiscal year, not a calendar year.

However, the research is still valid, so I’m posting it here. ⚠️ DISCLAIMER: In their diaphanous wisdom, Reddit/Mods have decreed that posts be limited to a single attachment, which I’ve already used. This essay is adorned with several images to enhance its appeal and, more crucially, includes numerous charts, which I am regrettably unable to include here.

You can continue reading it here on WSB, but be forewarned—you’ll miss out on the visual aids that bring the data to life. The choice, dear reader, is yours. Well now, picture this: The clock has just struck midnight, and today — Friday, May 24, 2024 — has only begun to stretch its legs. I literally just mentioned that I originally wrote this research before Booz Allen Hamilton’s fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 results. Just a few hours ago, I went and bought myself a trunk full of Booz Allen Hamilton shares. And wouldn’t you know it, in just a handful of hours, that very company is set to unveil their earnings report, promising a significant move in the stock, one way or another. Again, I wrote this last week before the earnings. I leaped into this play guided by my trader’s intuition. Now, as I burn the midnight oil, I’m digging into the logic and facts behind that decision. I figured, heck, why not pen an essay about the things I uncover along the way? the number one provider of artificial intelligence (AI) services to the U.S. government. A bit of history Booz Allen Hamilton is no hip upstart. Nope. This institution was founded way back in 1914 by one Edwin G. Booz in the bustling city of Chicago, offering management consulting services before it was even fashionable. During the 1940s, it played a pivotal role in World War II, aiding the U.S. military in improving efficiency and logistics. A decade later, the firm found a niche working with U.S. defense contracts, cementing its reputation as a trusted advisor to Uncle Sam. So why focus on a company named like a law firm? Well, according to GovWin from Deltek — a leading market intelligence organization — Booz Allen is the number one provider of artificial intelligence (AI) services to the U.S. government. And unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’d know that the market currently embraces anything related to artificial intelligence with open arms and a hearty cheer. AI is the belle of the ball. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. For perspective, exactly one year ago (May 24, 2023), NVIDIA had a market capitalization of $760.2 billion. Today, she’s valued at $2.55 trillion. Why? It’s largely due to the insatiably high demand for its AI chips, which are essential for powering advanced AI applications. A reliable uptrend Booz Allen Hamilton boasts a legacy spanning over a century — they consider it 110 years young — but it wasn’t until 2010 that it opened its doors to public investors, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BAH. And if we take a gander at the company’s story as told by its yearly chart, from a humble low of $11.85 in 2012, Booz Allen has steadily climbed the ladder of success, closing today — or yesterday — at $156.83. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Historical yearly performance of Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) stock) here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. That’s a 1,224% ascent, with only a single slightly red year in between, marring the record in 2021. That’s quite the tale of endurance and growth, wouldn’t you say? Aren’t we late to the party, though? Well, Booz Allen Hamilton’s current market capitalization stands at a tidy $20 billion. It’s nothing to scoff at, mind you, but to put things in perspective, this ranks Booz Allen as the 955th most valuable company. There’s still plenty of rungs left to climb on the ladder and ample room for growth down the road. A significant catalyst I’m sharing a monthly chart. Generally speaking, BAH was meandering sideways for nearly three years. That is, until a year ago, on May 26, 2023, to be precise. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Monthly performance of Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) stock. The price level illustrates a resistance/support level between August 2020 and May 2023.) here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. Following that earnings report, the stock kicked up her heels and went on a 38% run over the next two months. Also, aside from better-than-expected earnings, Booz Allen Hamilton was awarded a $919 million Engineering, Development, Integration, and Technology-based Solutions (EDITS) contract. The contract supports the “Soldier as a System” concept, enhancing warfighter capabilities across multiple Department of Defense (DoD) agencies. The EDITS program promotes collaboration across service boundaries and aims to modernize and equip military tactical units, improving lethality, survivability, and situational awareness. Look at the competition Hold your horses. It’s not just one contract or one project propelling Booz Allen Hamilton skyward. The tide of AI is lifting all boats, so it’s not just one company sailing full steam ahead. Granted, Booz Allen offers a smorgasbord of services, thus facing several competitors in various fields. However, if we narrow our focus to the AI sector, some of the most direct competitors are: Leidos Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: LDOS) Leidos provides AI and machine learning solutions to various U.S. government agencies, including the Department of Defense (DoD). Their AI capabilities are integrated into solutions for cybersecurity, data analysis, and operational efficiency in defense and intelligence operations. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Daily performance of Leidos Holdings (LDOS) stock.

As you can see, when earnings roll around, these companies tend to pop and set off on a run northward, much like a hound hot on the trail. Each earnings report can become a potential catalyst, sparking a surge in investor enthusiasm and sending stock prices climbing. That’s what I’m playing. What I played. ----- Other high-profile projects Booz Allen Hamilton is involved in several high-profile projects that leverage AI. Some notable projects include: Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) Booz Allen supports the U.S. Department of Defense’s CJADC2 initiative alongside L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: LHX), which aims to integrate sensors, data, and weapon systems across all military domains — land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace — using AI and machine learning to enhance situational awareness and decision-making capabilities. Project Maven Booz Allen has been a key contractor in Project Maven, an AI program initiated by the Department of Defense, which among other things, aims to analyze video footage from drones using machine learning algorithms to identify objects and patterns, significantly improving intelligence and surveillance operations. Project Linchpin It is the U.S. Army’s first program of record providing an artificial intelligence operations pipeline. It is currently just a $2 million contract to support research and development, but it is anticipated to be followed by subsequent juicier contracts. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here.

Satellites Booz Allen also made a strategic investment in Albedo, the first company to operate satellites in very low Earth orbit (VLEO), which enables them to offer ultra-high resolution commercial imagery from space.

And if we take a gander at the company’s story as told by its yearly chart, from a humble low of $11.85 in 2012, Booz Allen has steadily climbed the ladder of success, closing today — or yesterday — at $156.83. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Historical yearly performance of Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) stock) here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. That’s a 1,224% ascent, with only a single slightly red year in between, marring the record in 2021. That’s quite the tale of endurance and growth, wouldn’t you say? Aren’t we late to the party, though? Well, Booz Allen Hamilton’s current market capitalization stands at a tidy $20 billion. It’s nothing to scoff at, mind you, but to put things in perspective, this ranks Booz Allen as the 955th most valuable company. There’s still plenty of rungs left to climb on the ladder and ample room for growth down the road. A significant catalyst I’m sharing a monthly chart. Generally speaking, BAH was meandering sideways for nearly three years. That is, until a year ago, on May 26, 2023, to be precise. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Monthly performance of Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) stock. The price level illustrates a resistance/support level between August 2020 and May 2023.) here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. Following that earnings report, the stock kicked up her heels and went on a 38% run over the next two months. Also, aside from better-than-expected earnings, Booz Allen Hamilton was awarded a $919 million Engineering, Development, Integration, and Technology-based Solutions (EDITS) contract. The contract supports the “Soldier as a System” concept, enhancing warfighter capabilities across multiple Department of Defense (DoD) agencies. The EDITS program promotes collaboration across service boundaries and aims to modernize and equip military tactical units, improving lethality, survivability, and situational awareness. Look at the competition Hold your horses. It’s not just one contract or one project propelling Booz Allen Hamilton skyward. The tide of AI is lifting all boats, so it’s not just one company sailing full steam ahead. Granted, Booz Allen offers a smorgasbord of services, thus facing several competitors in various fields. However, if we narrow our focus to the AI sector, some of the most direct competitors are: Leidos Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: LDOS) Leidos provides AI and machine learning solutions to various U.S. government agencies, including the Department of Defense (DoD). Their AI capabilities are integrated into solutions for cybersecurity, data analysis, and operational efficiency in defense and intelligence operations. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Daily performance of Leidos Holdings (LDOS) stock.

As you can see, when earnings roll around, these companies tend to pop and set off on a run northward, much like a hound hot on the trail. Each earnings report can become a potential catalyst, sparking a surge in investor enthusiasm and sending stock prices climbing. That’s what I’m playing. What I played. ----- Other high-profile projects Booz Allen Hamilton is involved in several high-profile projects that leverage AI. Some notable projects include: Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) Booz Allen supports the U.S. Department of Defense’s CJADC2 initiative alongside L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: LHX), which aims to integrate sensors, data, and weapon systems across all military domains — land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace — using AI and machine learning to enhance situational awareness and decision-making capabilities. Project Maven Booz Allen has been a key contractor in Project Maven, an AI program initiated by the Department of Defense, which among other things, aims to analyze video footage from drones using machine learning algorithms to identify objects and patterns, significantly improving intelligence and surveillance operations. Project Linchpin It is the U.S. Army’s first program of record providing an artificial intelligence operations pipeline. It is currently just a $2 million contract to support research and development, but it is anticipated to be followed by subsequent juicier contracts. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. Satellites Booz Allen also made a strategic investment in Albedo, the first company to operate satellites in very low Earth orbit (VLEO), which enables them to offer ultra-high resolution commercial imagery from space. Let’s take a moment to chill because it’s not all black ops and military projects. U.S. Department of Energy On March 12, 2024, Booz Allen Hamilton announced it was awarded a ten-year $550 million contract from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) to support the advancement of high-potential, high-impact, early-stage technologies that generate, store, and use energy in entirely new ways to reduce U.S. emissions, improve energy efficiency, and increase the resiliency and reliability of the U.S. power grid. To give you an idea, ARPA-E is tasked with identifying, shepherding, and accelerating “…the stuff that sounds crazy until it changes the world.” U.S. Environmental Protection Agency On May 8, 2024, the company announced it was awarded a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) to support the agency’s modernization efforts and its mission to protect human health and the environment. Booz Allen won one of four positions on the seven-year Scientific Modeling, Application, Visualization, Computational Science, Software, and Statistical Support (SMAVCS4) BPA, which has a ceiling of $431 million. And many more Booz Allen has nearly 200 active AI projects across defense, national security, and civil missions — including three of the largest AI contracts within the Department of Defense. Understandably, many of them are top secret. 🤐 Late last year, an analyst noted that 2,200 BAH employees are considered ‘AI staff,’ with a staggering 80% holding government security clearances. The company’s AI capabilities are not just extensive but also deeply integrated into sensitive areas of national security. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. For those curious souls wanting to delve deeper, check out Booz Allen Hamilton’s Leading AI for the Federal Government portal. If your stars align, you might even consider applying for a job since they’re growing and looking to fill a multitude of positions. What analysts are saying In a February research report, William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma mentioned that the outbreak of multiple wars and the artificial intelligence boom “have led to an inflection in government tech hiring and bookings that we feel has some serious legs.” And also, that Booz Allen “remains the government’s go-to source to modernize the military and prepare for conflicts.” In fact, the company “has more backlog than it can handle as government spending has surged on Pacific tensions and AI prototyping.” Finally, this week (May 21, 2024), Stifel raised its price target for BAH to $170 from $155 (from the chart above that you can't see, BAH was $156.83), keeping a buy rating since “AI, cyber and IT modernization remain in focus for the government.” Besides, there have been recently approved federal budget and supplemental spending packages. According to data from William Blair, the analyst sentiment towards Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) is overwhelmingly positive. Not a single soul is suggesting to sell, which paints a promising picture for our tale. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image with the current rating distribution. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. This table could be important to see. Their aiSSEMBLE solution Just recently — on April 30, 2024 — Booz Allen Hamilton announced the launch of aiSSEMBLE Baseline, a first-of-its-kind, open-source solution built to simplify the engineering and deployment of AI systems. Booz Allen Hamilton boasts that aiSSEMBLE is the core tool cementing its status as the leading AI provider to the U.S. federal government. If that’s the case, it suggests that this new foundational code, complete with open-source documentation and free for use by government, academic, nonprofit, and commercial entities, could further extend Booz Allen’s lead. It can also help them with talent acquisition. By opening the doors to aiSSEMBLE, Booz Allen is inviting a wave of innovation from all corners — government agencies, universities, nonprofits, and private firms — because some bright sparks out there will undoubtedly create remarkable innovations using aiSSEMBLE, catching Booz Allen’s eye in the process. There’s one kink, though… Booz Allen Hamilton’s own top brass sold shares on May 21, 2024. Those actions were filed with the SEC a day before BHA was scheduled to report earnings. There are eight Form-4s. For those not in the know, a Form-4 is a statement of changes in beneficial ownership of securities by company insiders. But wait a second. Let’s dig deeper. All the Form-4s state they first acquired shares through the vesting of performance-based restricted stock units (RSUs). These RSUs are a form of compensation granted to employees, becoming vested and thereby exercisable or transferable based on achieving specific performance criteria over a set period. In other words, they hit a target — they accomplish a goal — and they’re rewarded with stock. The shares they sold are just a part of the shares acquired. For instance, the CEO — Horacio Rozanski — received 71,575 shares, and he decided to sell 34,571. The EVP & Chief Operating Officer Kristine Anderson acquired 7,544 shares and sold 3,644. Not a single one of them decided to sell the farm and run away. Therefore, they might have sold a portion to cover taxes or diversify their portfolios. This is a common practice and doesn’t necessarily reflect a lack of confidence in the company’s future. Besides, the number of shares sold is minimal compared to the total number they still hold. I told you the CEO sold 34,571 shares, but he is still holding 579,025 more. Kristine sold 3,644, but she still has 72,761. In the end, it is not a red flag. But it was a kink I didn’t appreciate, considering they still decided to sell before earnings. Then again, it’s quite plausible that Booz Allen Hamilton’s top brass might be governed by internal clauses dictating when they can sell their vested shares. After all, many companies have strict trading windows and blackout periods to prevent any appearance of insider trading or conflict of interest. Nonetheless, this was one of the two reasons why I only bought a trunk instead of backing up a Freightliner to load up with shares. How my gambit played out Honestly, there's no point in narrating the play on Reddit since I can't add the entry, premarket charts, profit, or any attachments. So... if you care about how I played this, the link is here. One more insight I learned Booz Allen Hamilton and its helmsman, Horacio Rozanski, aren’t clamoring atop the AI hype train, hollering for investors to crown them the new AI darling everyone should own. Make no mistake, they’re an AI powerhouse. It’s just that they’re not focused on selling the sizzle. In the current world, where companies blare out press releases at the faintest whiff of anything AI-related to entice investors, Booz Allen Hamilton — armed with bona fide credentials — opts to toil diligently away from the limelight. Perhaps it’s by design, though. Considering this is a company that lists its fiscal 2024 revenue with most projects cloaked in secrecy. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here with all their classified contracts. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. So what happens now? I’ve already tipped my hand and no longer hold any BAH shares. My play has come and gone. Considering today's pullback, I bought a small number of September and December calls. Now, after reading this essay, could someone consider investing in Booz Allen Hamilton? Maybe. AI is set to grow, the U.S. government is bound to expand its AI use, and this company is already well-positioned to secure more projects. So, why am I not invested in BAH? Because I’m neither an investor nor a position trader. I’m a short-term swing trader. I played this earnings catalyst, made some profit, and then walked away. Granted, after this deep dive, I’ll keep an eye on BAH and might tag along if she sets up for a northward run. But I know my timeframe. I know my trading style and my limitations. Likewise, it’s up to you to know your trading style and decide what to do with this information. Keep in mind, BAH experienced some volatility selling, and the implied volatility dipped post-earnings and guidance. Probably because some who positioned ahead of earnings were expecting a bigger leap. It’s logical to assume some will take their profits (as we saw today), so don't jump blindly. On the flip side, these earnings mostly flew under the radar. Booz Allen Hamilton remains an AI colossus that most retail traders haven’t even heard of. Besides, do you know how many will actually read this and understand the information? At any rate, now you know what I know. Have a great day.",sir...this is a Wendy's,0,0.502,0.967,POSITIVE
,"My deep dive on Booz Allen Hamilton’s AI dominance and what it means for traders I'm sharing my research so YOU can make a better decision. I know many members prefer to be told what to buy, but this is an essay, not a BanBet. My current BanBet record is 31-20, which is so-so. But honestly, you should still learn how to trade, not how to shadow. So why should you read this? That's something you have to decide. Read the title. Only you can decide whether it makes sense to find out more about this company, or not. This is the only image I can post here. 🙁 ❗️ TL;DR: Look here, this essay’s got more words than a politician’s promise, and it doesn't even spoon-feeds you a play. Preposterous! If you’re itching to block me, here’s your guide. Now, if the sheer volume of words is giving you the vapors, I don’t blame you. Just look at this behemoth of text. By golly! Let’s face it: you don’t really want to be here, and you’re likely not my audience (folks who actually enjoy reading and/or appreciate knowledge). So, I’d just as soon see you off. Sure, you could go outside and indulge in memes, but I wager you’ve got a primal need to scroll down and leave a gripe about how absurd it is to expect anyone to wade through this verbosity. Well, go ahead. Vent away. Hello. Welcome. You should already know that in today's financial markets, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as the golden prodigy, with investors flocking like bees to honey, eagerly snapping up stocks from those trailblazing companies leading the AI revolution. Amidst this fervor, one company stands as the top purveyor of AI services to the U.S. government. Yet, it remains unknown to the general populace. This essay delves into why Booz Allen Hamilton has earned this position, the significant impact of its AI initiatives, and what this means for traders keen to ride the AI boom. Interested? Keep reading, then. ⚠️ WARNING: I originally wrote this research before Booz Allen Hamilton’s fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 results. Fiscal year, not a calendar year. And I did share my findings with other traders on time. If you are reading this now, that event is already in the past. However, the research is still valid, so I’m posting it here. ⚠️ DISCLAIMER: In their diaphanous wisdom, Reddit/Mods have decreed that posts be limited to a single attachment, which I’ve already used. This essay is adorned with several images to enhance its appeal and, more crucially, includes numerous charts, which I am regrettably unable to include here. If you wish to peruse the full essay with all its illustrative charts, here’s the link. You can continue reading it here on WSB, but be forewarned—you’ll miss out on the visual aids that bring the data to life. The choice, dear reader, is yours. Well now, picture this: The clock has just struck midnight, and today — Friday, May 24, 2024 — has only begun to stretch its legs. I literally just mentioned that I originally wrote this research before Booz Allen Hamilton’s fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 results. Just a few hours ago, I went and bought myself a trunk full of Booz Allen Hamilton shares. And wouldn’t you know it, in just a handful of hours, that very company is set to unveil their earnings report, promising a significant move in the stock, one way or another. Again, I wrote this last week before the earnings. I leaped into this play guided by my trader’s intuition. Now, as I burn the midnight oil, I’m digging into the logic and facts behind that decision. I figured, heck, why not pen an essay about the things I uncover along the way? the number one provider of artificial intelligence (AI) services to the U.S. government. A bit of history Booz Allen Hamilton is no hip upstart. Nope. This institution was founded way back in 1914 by one Edwin G. Booz in the bustling city of Chicago, offering management consulting services before it was even fashionable. During the 1940s, it played a pivotal role in World War II, aiding the U.S. military in improving efficiency and logistics. A decade later, the firm found a niche working with U.S. defense contracts, cementing its reputation as a trusted advisor to Uncle Sam. So why focus on a company named like a law firm? Well, according to GovWin from Deltek — a leading market intelligence organization — Booz Allen is the number one provider of artificial intelligence (AI) services to the U.S. government. And unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’d know that the market currently embraces anything related to artificial intelligence with open arms and a hearty cheer. AI is the belle of the ball. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link.

I know many members prefer to be told what to buy, but this is an essay, not a BanBet. My current BanBet record is 31-20, which is so-so. But honestly, you should still learn how to trade, not how to shadow. So why should you read this? That's something you have to decide. Read the title. Only you can decide whether it makes sense to find out more about this company, or not. This is the only image I can post here. 🙁 ❗️ TL;DR: Look here, this essay’s got more words than a politician’s promise, and it doesn't even spoon-feeds you a play. Preposterous! If you’re itching to block me, here’s your guide. Now, if the sheer volume of words is giving you the vapors, I don’t blame you. Just look at this behemoth of text. By golly! Let’s face it: you don’t really want to be here, and you’re likely not my audience (folks who actually enjoy reading and/or appreciate knowledge). So, I’d just as soon see you off. Sure, you could go outside and indulge in memes, but I wager you’ve got a primal need to scroll down and leave a gripe about how absurd it is to expect anyone to wade through this verbosity. Well, go ahead. Vent away. Hello. Welcome. You should already know that in today's financial markets, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as the golden prodigy, with investors flocking like bees to honey, eagerly snapping up stocks from those trailblazing companies leading the AI revolution. Amidst this fervor, one company stands as the top purveyor of AI services to the U.S. government. Yet, it remains unknown to the general populace. This essay delves into why Booz Allen Hamilton has earned this position, the significant impact of its AI initiatives, and what this means for traders keen to ride the AI boom. Interested? Keep reading, then. ⚠️ WARNING: I originally wrote this research before Booz Allen Hamilton’s fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 results. Fiscal year, not a calendar year. And I did share my findings with other traders on time. If you are reading this now, that event is already in the past. However, the research is still valid, so I’m posting it here. ⚠️ DISCLAIMER: In their diaphanous wisdom, Reddit/Mods have decreed that posts be limited to a single attachment, which I’ve already used. This essay is adorned with several images to enhance its appeal and, more crucially, includes numerous charts, which I am regrettably unable to include here.

You can continue reading it here on WSB, but be forewarned—you’ll miss out on the visual aids that bring the data to life. The choice, dear reader, is yours. Well now, picture this: The clock has just struck midnight, and today — Friday, May 24, 2024 — has only begun to stretch its legs. I literally just mentioned that I originally wrote this research before Booz Allen Hamilton’s fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 results. Just a few hours ago, I went and bought myself a trunk full of Booz Allen Hamilton shares. And wouldn’t you know it, in just a handful of hours, that very company is set to unveil their earnings report, promising a significant move in the stock, one way or another. Again, I wrote this last week before the earnings. I leaped into this play guided by my trader’s intuition. Now, as I burn the midnight oil, I’m digging into the logic and facts behind that decision. I figured, heck, why not pen an essay about the things I uncover along the way? the number one provider of artificial intelligence (AI) services to the U.S. government. A bit of history Booz Allen Hamilton is no hip upstart. Nope. This institution was founded way back in 1914 by one Edwin G. Booz in the bustling city of Chicago, offering management consulting services before it was even fashionable. During the 1940s, it played a pivotal role in World War II, aiding the U.S. military in improving efficiency and logistics. A decade later, the firm found a niche working with U.S. defense contracts, cementing its reputation as a trusted advisor to Uncle Sam. So why focus on a company named like a law firm? Well, according to GovWin from Deltek — a leading market intelligence organization — Booz Allen is the number one provider of artificial intelligence (AI) services to the U.S. government. And unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’d know that the market currently embraces anything related to artificial intelligence with open arms and a hearty cheer. AI is the belle of the ball. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. For perspective, exactly one year ago (May 24, 2023), NVIDIA had a market capitalization of $760.2 billion. Today, she’s valued at $2.55 trillion. Why? It’s largely due to the insatiably high demand for its AI chips, which are essential for powering advanced AI applications. A reliable uptrend Booz Allen Hamilton boasts a legacy spanning over a century — they consider it 110 years young — but it wasn’t until 2010 that it opened its doors to public investors, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BAH. And if we take a gander at the company’s story as told by its yearly chart, from a humble low of $11.85 in 2012, Booz Allen has steadily climbed the ladder of success, closing today — or yesterday — at $156.83. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Historical yearly performance of Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) stock) here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. That’s a 1,224% ascent, with only a single slightly red year in between, marring the record in 2021. That’s quite the tale of endurance and growth, wouldn’t you say? Aren’t we late to the party, though? Well, Booz Allen Hamilton’s current market capitalization stands at a tidy $20 billion. It’s nothing to scoff at, mind you, but to put things in perspective, this ranks Booz Allen as the 955th most valuable company. There’s still plenty of rungs left to climb on the ladder and ample room for growth down the road. A significant catalyst I’m sharing a monthly chart. Generally speaking, BAH was meandering sideways for nearly three years. That is, until a year ago, on May 26, 2023, to be precise. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Monthly performance of Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) stock.

Following that earnings report, the stock kicked up her heels and went on a 38% run over the next two months. Also, aside from better-than-expected earnings, Booz Allen Hamilton was awarded a $919 million Engineering, Development, Integration, and Technology-based Solutions (EDITS) contract. The contract supports the “Soldier as a System” concept, enhancing warfighter capabilities across multiple Department of Defense (DoD) agencies. The EDITS program promotes collaboration across service boundaries and aims to modernize and equip military tactical units, improving lethality, survivability, and situational awareness. Look at the competition Hold your horses. It’s not just one contract or one project propelling Booz Allen Hamilton skyward. The tide of AI is lifting all boats, so it’s not just one company sailing full steam ahead. Granted, Booz Allen offers a smorgasbord of services, thus facing several competitors in various fields. However, if we narrow our focus to the AI sector, some of the most direct competitors are: Leidos Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: LDOS) Leidos provides AI and machine learning solutions to various U.S. government agencies, including the Department of Defense (DoD). Their AI capabilities are integrated into solutions for cybersecurity, data analysis, and operational efficiency in defense and intelligence operations. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Daily performance of Leidos Holdings (LDOS) stock.

As you can see, when earnings roll around, these companies tend to pop and set off on a run northward, much like a hound hot on the trail. Each earnings report can become a potential catalyst, sparking a surge in investor enthusiasm and sending stock prices climbing. That’s what I’m playing. What I played. ----- Other high-profile projects Booz Allen Hamilton is involved in several high-profile projects that leverage AI. Some notable projects include: Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) Booz Allen supports the U.S. Department of Defense’s CJADC2 initiative alongside L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: LHX), which aims to integrate sensors, data, and weapon systems across all military domains — land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace — using AI and machine learning to enhance situational awareness and decision-making capabilities. Project Maven Booz Allen has been a key contractor in Project Maven, an AI program initiated by the Department of Defense, which among other things, aims to analyze video footage from drones using machine learning algorithms to identify objects and patterns, significantly improving intelligence and surveillance operations. Project Linchpin It is the U.S. Army’s first program of record providing an artificial intelligence operations pipeline. It is currently just a $2 million contract to support research and development, but it is anticipated to be followed by subsequent juicier contracts. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. Satellites Booz Allen also made a strategic investment in Albedo, the first company to operate satellites in very low Earth orbit (VLEO), which enables them to offer ultra-high resolution commercial imagery from space. Let’s take a moment to chill because it’s not all black ops and military projects. U.S. Department of Energy On March 12, 2024, Booz Allen Hamilton announced it was awarded a ten-year $550 million contract from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) to support the advancement of high-potential, high-impact, early-stage technologies that generate, store, and use energy in entirely new ways to reduce U.S. emissions, improve energy efficiency, and increase the resiliency and reliability of the U.S. power grid. To give you an idea, ARPA-E is tasked with identifying, shepherding, and accelerating “…the stuff that sounds crazy until it changes the world.” U.S. Environmental Protection Agency On May 8, 2024, the company announced it was awarded a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) to support the agency’s modernization efforts and its mission to protect human health and the environment. Booz Allen won one of four positions on the seven-year Scientific Modeling, Application, Visualization, Computational Science, Software, and Statistical Support (SMAVCS4) BPA, which has a ceiling of $431 million. And many more Booz Allen has nearly 200 active AI projects across defense, national security, and civil missions — including three of the largest AI contracts within the Department of Defense. Understandably, many of them are top secret. 🤐 Late last year, an analyst noted that 2,200 BAH employees are considered ‘AI staff,’ with a staggering 80% holding government security clearances. The company’s AI capabilities are not just extensive but also deeply integrated into sensitive areas of national security. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. For those curious souls wanting to delve deeper, check out Booz Allen Hamilton’s Leading AI for the Federal Government portal. If your stars align, you might even consider applying for a job since they’re growing and looking to fill a multitude of positions. What analysts are saying In a February research report, William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma mentioned that the outbreak of multiple wars and the artificial intelligence boom “have led to an inflection in government tech hiring and bookings that we feel has some serious legs.” And also, that Booz Allen “remains the government’s go-to source to modernize the military and prepare for conflicts.” In fact, the company “has more backlog than it can handle as government spending has surged on Pacific tensions and AI prototyping.” Finally, this week (May 21, 2024), Stifel raised its price target for BAH to $170 from $155 (from the chart above that you can't see, BAH was $156.83), keeping a buy rating since “AI, cyber and IT modernization remain in focus for the government.” Besides, there have been recently approved federal budget and supplemental spending packages. According to data from William Blair, the analyst sentiment towards Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) is overwhelmingly positive. Not a single soul is suggesting to sell, which paints a promising picture for our tale. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image with the current rating distribution. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. This table could be important to see. Their aiSSEMBLE solution Just recently — on April 30, 2024 — Booz Allen Hamilton announced the launch of aiSSEMBLE Baseline, a first-of-its-kind, open-source solution built to simplify the engineering and deployment of AI systems. Booz Allen Hamilton boasts that aiSSEMBLE is the core tool cementing its status as the leading AI provider to the U.S. federal government. If that’s the case, it suggests that this new foundational code, complete with open-source documentation and free for use by government, academic, nonprofit, and commercial entities, could further extend Booz Allen’s lead. It can also help them with talent acquisition. By opening the doors to aiSSEMBLE, Booz Allen is inviting a wave of innovation from all corners — government agencies, universities, nonprofits, and private firms — because some bright sparks out there will undoubtedly create remarkable innovations using aiSSEMBLE, catching Booz Allen’s eye in the process. There’s one kink, though… Booz Allen Hamilton’s own top brass sold shares on May 21, 2024. Those actions were filed with the SEC a day before BHA was scheduled to report earnings. There are eight Form-4s. For those not in the know, a Form-4 is a statement of changes in beneficial ownership of securities by company insiders. But wait a second. Let’s dig deeper. All the Form-4s state they first acquired shares through the vesting of performance-based restricted stock units (RSUs). These RSUs are a form of compensation granted to employees, becoming vested and thereby exercisable or transferable based on achieving specific performance criteria over a set period. In other words, they hit a target — they accomplish a goal — and they’re rewarded with stock. The shares they sold are just a part of the shares acquired. For instance, the CEO — Horacio Rozanski — received 71,575 shares, and he decided to sell 34,571. The EVP & Chief Operating Officer Kristine Anderson acquired 7,544 shares and sold 3,644. Not a single one of them decided to sell the farm and run away. Therefore, they might have sold a portion to cover taxes or diversify their portfolios. This is a common practice and doesn’t necessarily reflect a lack of confidence in the company’s future. Besides, the number of shares sold is minimal compared to the total number they still hold. I told you the CEO sold 34,571 shares, but he is still holding 579,025 more. Kristine sold 3,644, but she still has 72,761. In the end, it is not a red flag. But it was a kink I didn’t appreciate, considering they still decided to sell before earnings. Then again, it’s quite plausible that Booz Allen Hamilton’s top brass might be governed by internal clauses dictating when they can sell their vested shares. After all, many companies have strict trading windows and blackout periods to prevent any appearance of insider trading or conflict of interest. Nonetheless, this was one of the two reasons why I only bought a trunk instead of backing up a Freightliner to load up with shares. How my gambit played out Honestly, there's no point in narrating the play on Reddit since I can't add the entry, premarket charts, profit, or any attachments. So... if you care about how I played this, the link is here. One more insight I learned Booz Allen Hamilton and its helmsman, Horacio Rozanski, aren’t clamoring atop the AI hype train, hollering for investors to crown them the new AI darling everyone should own. Make no mistake, they’re an AI powerhouse. It’s just that they’re not focused on selling the sizzle. In the current world, where companies blare out press releases at the faintest whiff of anything AI-related to entice investors, Booz Allen Hamilton — armed with bona fide credentials — opts to toil diligently away from the limelight. Perhaps it’s by design, though. Considering this is a company that lists its fiscal 2024 revenue with most projects cloaked in secrecy. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here with all their classified contracts. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. So what happens now? I’ve already tipped my hand and no longer hold any BAH shares. My play has come and gone. Considering today's pullback, I bought a small number of September and December calls. Now, after reading this essay, could someone consider investing in Booz Allen Hamilton? Maybe. AI is set to grow, the U.S. government is bound to expand its AI use, and this company is already well-positioned to secure more projects. So, why am I not invested in BAH? Because I’m neither an investor nor a position trader. I’m a short-term swing trader. I played this earnings catalyst, made some profit, and then walked away. Granted, after this deep dive, I’ll keep an eye on BAH and might tag along if she sets up for a northward run. But I know my timeframe. I know my trading style and my limitations. Likewise, it’s up to you to know your trading style and decide what to do with this information. Keep in mind, BAH experienced some volatility selling, and the implied volatility dipped post-earnings and guidance. Probably because some who positioned ahead of earnings were expecting a bigger leap. It’s logical to assume some will take their profits (as we saw today), so don't jump blindly. On the flip side, these earnings mostly flew under the radar. Booz Allen Hamilton remains an AI colossus that most retail traders haven’t even heard of. Besides, do you know how many will actually read this and understand the information? At any rate, now you know what I know. Have a great day.","I have not researched them, but her chart looks nice.I'm willing to play long-dated calls on BAH because their business is spread out across the federal government, which lessens the impact if budgets change after the election.However, the fact is I haven't researched them.",1,0.54,0.998,NEGATIVE

If that’s the case, it suggests that this new foundational code, complete with open-source documentation and free for use by government, academic, nonprofit, and commercial entities, could further extend Booz Allen’s lead. It can also help them with talent acquisition. By opening the doors to aiSSEMBLE, Booz Allen is inviting a wave of innovation from all corners — government agencies, universities, nonprofits, and private firms — because some bright sparks out there will undoubtedly create remarkable innovations using aiSSEMBLE, catching Booz Allen’s eye in the process. There’s one kink, though… Booz Allen Hamilton’s own top brass sold shares on May 21, 2024. Those actions were filed with the SEC a day before BHA was scheduled to report earnings. There are eight Form-4s. For those not in the know, a Form-4 is a statement of changes in beneficial ownership of securities by company insiders. But wait a second. Let’s dig deeper. All the Form-4s state they first acquired shares through the vesting of performance-based restricted stock units (RSUs). These RSUs are a form of compensation granted to employees, becoming vested and thereby exercisable or transferable based on achieving specific performance criteria over a set period. In other words, they hit a target — they accomplish a goal — and they’re rewarded with stock. The shares they sold are just a part of the shares acquired. For instance, the CEO — Horacio Rozanski — received 71,575 shares, and he decided to sell 34,571. The EVP & Chief Operating Officer Kristine Anderson acquired 7,544 shares and sold 3,644. Not a single one of them decided to sell the farm and run away. Therefore, they might have sold a portion to cover taxes or diversify their portfolios. This is a common practice and doesn’t necessarily reflect a lack of confidence in the company’s future. Besides, the number of shares sold is minimal compared to the total number they still hold. I told you the CEO sold 34,571 shares, but he is still holding 579,025 more. Kristine sold 3,644, but she still has 72,761. In the end, it is not a red flag. But it was a kink I didn’t appreciate, considering they still decided to sell before earnings. Then again, it’s quite plausible that Booz Allen Hamilton’s top brass might be governed by internal clauses dictating when they can sell their vested shares. After all, many companies have strict trading windows and blackout periods to prevent any appearance of insider trading or conflict of interest. Nonetheless, this was one of the two reasons why I only bought a trunk instead of backing up a Freightliner to load up with shares. How my gambit played out Honestly, there's no point in narrating the play on Reddit since I can't add the entry, premarket charts, profit, or any attachments. So... if you care about how I played this, the link is here. One more insight I learned Booz Allen Hamilton and its helmsman, Horacio Rozanski, aren’t clamoring atop the AI hype train, hollering for investors to crown them the new AI darling everyone should own. Make no mistake, they’re an AI powerhouse. It’s just that they’re not focused on selling the sizzle. In the current world, where companies blare out press releases at the faintest whiff of anything AI-related to entice investors, Booz Allen Hamilton — armed with bona fide credentials — opts to toil diligently away from the limelight. Perhaps it’s by design, though. Considering this is a company that lists its fiscal 2024 revenue with most projects cloaked in secrecy. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here with all their classified contracts. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. So what happens now? I’ve already tipped my hand and no longer hold any BAH shares. My play has come and gone. Considering today's pullback, I bought a small number of September and December calls. Now, after reading this essay, could someone consider investing in Booz Allen Hamilton? Maybe. AI is set to grow, the U.S. government is bound to expand its AI use, and this company is already well-positioned to secure more projects. So, why am I not invested in BAH? Because I’m neither an investor nor a position trader. I’m a short-term swing trader. I played this earnings catalyst, made some profit, and then walked away. Granted, after this deep dive, I’ll keep an eye on BAH and might tag along if she sets up for a northward run. But I know my timeframe. I know my trading style and my limitations. Likewise, it’s up to you to know your trading style and decide what to do with this information. Keep in mind, BAH experienced some volatility selling, and the implied volatility dipped post-earnings and guidance. Probably because some who positioned ahead of earnings were expecting a bigger leap. It’s logical to assume some will take their profits (as we saw today), so don't jump blindly. On the flip side, these earnings mostly flew under the radar. Booz Allen Hamilton remains an AI colossus that most retail traders haven’t even heard of. Besides, do you know how many will actually read this and understand the information? At any rate, now you know what I know. Have a great day.","🗂️ My previous DD:If you start hearing about 🇷🇸 Serbia in the news, here's my initial DD.20-22% VIX calls (one day)30% ENLT puts (two days)--Potential Estimated Economic Impact (Oil and VIX) of War 🇮🇷 🇮🇱5% IBIT short (one day)8% OILD (four days)--My current BanBet record: 31-20",0,0.521,0.999,NEGATIVE

I literally just mentioned that I originally wrote this research before Booz Allen Hamilton’s fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 results. Just a few hours ago, I went and bought myself a trunk full of Booz Allen Hamilton shares. And wouldn’t you know it, in just a handful of hours, that very company is set to unveil their earnings report, promising a significant move in the stock, one way or another. Again, I wrote this last week before the earnings. I leaped into this play guided by my trader’s intuition. Now, as I burn the midnight oil, I’m digging into the logic and facts behind that decision. I figured, heck, why not pen an essay about the things I uncover along the way? the number one provider of artificial intelligence (AI) services to the U.S. government. A bit of history Booz Allen Hamilton is no hip upstart. Nope. This institution was founded way back in 1914 by one Edwin G. Booz in the bustling city of Chicago, offering management consulting services before it was even fashionable. During the 1940s, it played a pivotal role in World War II, aiding the U.S. military in improving efficiency and logistics. A decade later, the firm found a niche working with U.S. defense contracts, cementing its reputation as a trusted advisor to Uncle Sam. So why focus on a company named like a law firm? Well, according to GovWin from Deltek — a leading market intelligence organization — Booz Allen is the number one provider of artificial intelligence (AI) services to the U.S. government. And unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’d know that the market currently embraces anything related to artificial intelligence with open arms and a hearty cheer. AI is the belle of the ball. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. For perspective, exactly one year ago (May 24, 2023), NVIDIA had a market capitalization of $760.2 billion. Today, she’s valued at $2.55 trillion. Why? It’s largely due to the insatiably high demand for its AI chips, which are essential for powering advanced AI applications. A reliable uptrend Booz Allen Hamilton boasts a legacy spanning over a century — they consider it 110 years young — but it wasn’t until 2010 that it opened its doors to public investors, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BAH. And if we take a gander at the company’s story as told by its yearly chart, from a humble low of $11.85 in 2012, Booz Allen has steadily climbed the ladder of success, closing today — or yesterday — at $156.83. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Historical yearly performance of Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) stock) here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. That’s a 1,224% ascent, with only a single slightly red year in between, marring the record in 2021. That’s quite the tale of endurance and growth, wouldn’t you say? Aren’t we late to the party, though? Well, Booz Allen Hamilton’s current market capitalization stands at a tidy $20 billion. It’s nothing to scoff at, mind you, but to put things in perspective, this ranks Booz Allen as the 955th most valuable company. There’s still plenty of rungs left to climb on the ladder and ample room for growth down the road. A significant catalyst I’m sharing a monthly chart. Generally speaking, BAH was meandering sideways for nearly three years. That is, until a year ago, on May 26, 2023, to be precise. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Monthly performance of Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) stock. The price level illustrates a resistance/support level between August 2020 and May 2023.) here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. Following that earnings report, the stock kicked up her heels and went on a 38% run over the next two months. Also, aside from better-than-expected earnings, Booz Allen Hamilton was awarded a $919 million Engineering, Development, Integration, and Technology-based Solutions (EDITS) contract. The contract supports the “Soldier as a System” concept, enhancing warfighter capabilities across multiple Department of Defense (DoD) agencies. The EDITS program promotes collaboration across service boundaries and aims to modernize and equip military tactical units, improving lethality, survivability, and situational awareness. Look at the competition Hold your horses. It’s not just one contract or one project propelling Booz Allen Hamilton skyward. The tide of AI is lifting all boats, so it’s not just one company sailing full steam ahead. Granted, Booz Allen offers a smorgasbord of services, thus facing several competitors in various fields. However, if we narrow our focus to the AI sector, some of the most direct competitors are: Leidos Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: LDOS) Leidos provides AI and machine learning solutions to various U.S. government agencies, including the Department of Defense (DoD). Their AI capabilities are integrated into solutions for cybersecurity, data analysis, and operational efficiency in defense and intelligence operations. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Daily performance of Leidos Holdings (LDOS) stock.

As you can see, when earnings roll around, these companies tend to pop and set off on a run northward, much like a hound hot on the trail. Each earnings report can become a potential catalyst, sparking a surge in investor enthusiasm and sending stock prices climbing. That’s what I’m playing. What I played. ----- Other high-profile projects Booz Allen Hamilton is involved in several high-profile projects that leverage AI. Some notable projects include: Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) Booz Allen supports the U.S. Department of Defense’s CJADC2 initiative alongside L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: LHX), which aims to integrate sensors, data, and weapon systems across all military domains — land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace — using AI and machine learning to enhance situational awareness and decision-making capabilities. Project Maven Booz Allen has been a key contractor in Project Maven, an AI program initiated by the Department of Defense, which among other things, aims to analyze video footage from drones using machine learning algorithms to identify objects and patterns, significantly improving intelligence and surveillance operations. Project Linchpin It is the U.S. Army’s first program of record providing an artificial intelligence operations pipeline. It is currently just a $2 million contract to support research and development, but it is anticipated to be followed by subsequent juicier contracts. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. Satellites Booz Allen also made a strategic investment in Albedo, the first company to operate satellites in very low Earth orbit (VLEO), which enables them to offer ultra-high resolution commercial imagery from space. Let’s take a moment to chill because it’s not all black ops and military projects. U.S. Department of Energy On March 12, 2024, Booz Allen Hamilton announced it was awarded a ten-year $550 million contract from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) to support the advancement of high-potential, high-impact, early-stage technologies that generate, store, and use energy in entirely new ways to reduce U.S. emissions, improve energy efficiency, and increase the resiliency and reliability of the U.S. power grid. To give you an idea, ARPA-E is tasked with identifying, shepherding, and accelerating “…the stuff that sounds crazy until it changes the world.” U.S. Environmental Protection Agency On May 8, 2024, the company announced it was awarded a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) to support the agency’s modernization efforts and its mission to protect human health and the environment. Booz Allen won one of four positions on the seven-year Scientific Modeling, Application, Visualization, Computational Science, Software, and Statistical Support (SMAVCS4) BPA, which has a ceiling of $431 million. And many more Booz Allen has nearly 200 active AI projects across defense, national security, and civil missions — including three of the largest AI contracts within the Department of Defense. Understandably, many of them are top secret. 🤐 Late last year, an analyst noted that 2,200 BAH employees are considered ‘AI staff,’ with a staggering 80% holding government security clearances. The company’s AI capabilities are not just extensive but also deeply integrated into sensitive areas of national security. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here.

If your stars align, you might even consider applying for a job since they’re growing and looking to fill a multitude of positions. What analysts are saying In a February research report, William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma mentioned that the outbreak of multiple wars and the artificial intelligence boom “have led to an inflection in government tech hiring and bookings that we feel has some serious legs.” And also, that Booz Allen “remains the government’s go-to source to modernize the military and prepare for conflicts.” In fact, the company “has more backlog than it can handle as government spending has surged on Pacific tensions and AI prototyping.” Finally, this week (May 21, 2024), Stifel raised its price target for BAH to $170 from $155 (from the chart above that you can't see, BAH was $156.83), keeping a buy rating since “AI, cyber and IT modernization remain in focus for the government.” Besides, there have been recently approved federal budget and supplemental spending packages. According to data from William Blair, the analyst sentiment towards Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) is overwhelmingly positive. Not a single soul is suggesting to sell, which paints a promising picture for our tale. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image with the current rating distribution.

As you can see, when earnings roll around, these companies tend to pop and set off on a run northward, much like a hound hot on the trail. Each earnings report can become a potential catalyst, sparking a surge in investor enthusiasm and sending stock prices climbing. That’s what I’m playing. What I played. ----- Other high-profile projects Booz Allen Hamilton is involved in several high-profile projects that leverage AI. Some notable projects include: Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) Booz Allen supports the U.S. Department of Defense’s CJADC2 initiative alongside L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: LHX), which aims to integrate sensors, data, and weapon systems across all military domains — land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace — using AI and machine learning to enhance situational awareness and decision-making capabilities. Project Maven Booz Allen has been a key contractor in Project Maven, an AI program initiated by the Department of Defense, which among other things, aims to analyze video footage from drones using machine learning algorithms to identify objects and patterns, significantly improving intelligence and surveillance operations. Project Linchpin It is the U.S. Army’s first program of record providing an artificial intelligence operations pipeline. It is currently just a $2 million contract to support research and development, but it is anticipated to be followed by subsequent juicier contracts. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. Satellites Booz Allen also made a strategic investment in Albedo, the first company to operate satellites in very low Earth orbit (VLEO), which enables them to offer ultra-high resolution commercial imagery from space. Let’s take a moment to chill because it’s not all black ops and military projects. U.S. Department of Energy On March 12, 2024, Booz Allen Hamilton announced it was awarded a ten-year $550 million contract from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) to support the advancement of high-potential, high-impact, early-stage technologies that generate, store, and use energy in entirely new ways to reduce U.S. emissions, improve energy efficiency, and increase the resiliency and reliability of the U.S. power grid. To give you an idea, ARPA-E is tasked with identifying, shepherding, and accelerating “…the stuff that sounds crazy until it changes the world.” U.S. Environmental Protection Agency On May 8, 2024, the company announced it was awarded a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) to support the agency’s modernization efforts and its mission to protect human health and the environment. Booz Allen won one of four positions on the seven-year Scientific Modeling, Application, Visualization, Computational Science, Software, and Statistical Support (SMAVCS4) BPA, which has a ceiling of $431 million. And many more Booz Allen has nearly 200 active AI projects across defense, national security, and civil missions — including three of the largest AI contracts within the Department of Defense. Understandably, many of them are top secret. 🤐 Late last year, an analyst noted that 2,200 BAH employees are considered ‘AI staff,’ with a staggering 80% holding government security clearances. The company’s AI capabilities are not just extensive but also deeply integrated into sensitive areas of national security. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. For those curious souls wanting to delve deeper, check out Booz Allen Hamilton’s Leading AI for the Federal Government portal. If your stars align, you might even consider applying for a job since they’re growing and looking to fill a multitude of positions. What analysts are saying In a February research report, William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma mentioned that the outbreak of multiple wars and the artificial intelligence boom “have led to an inflection in government tech hiring and bookings that we feel has some serious legs.” And also, that Booz Allen “remains the government’s go-to source to modernize the military and prepare for conflicts.” In fact, the company “has more backlog than it can handle as government spending has surged on Pacific tensions and AI prototyping.” Finally, this week (May 21, 2024), Stifel raised its price target for BAH to $170 from $155 (from the chart above that you can't see, BAH was $156.83), keeping a buy rating since “AI, cyber and IT modernization remain in focus for the government.” Besides, there have been recently approved federal budget and supplemental spending packages. According to data from William Blair, the analyst sentiment towards Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) is overwhelmingly positive. Not a single soul is suggesting to sell, which paints a promising picture for our tale. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image with the current rating distribution. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. This table could be important to see. Their aiSSEMBLE solution Just recently — on April 30, 2024 — Booz Allen Hamilton announced the launch of aiSSEMBLE Baseline, a first-of-its-kind, open-source solution built to simplify the engineering and deployment of AI systems. Booz Allen Hamilton boasts that aiSSEMBLE is the core tool cementing its status as the leading AI provider to the U.S. federal government. If that’s the case, it suggests that this new foundational code, complete with open-source documentation and free for use by government, academic, nonprofit, and commercial entities, could further extend Booz Allen’s lead. It can also help them with talent acquisition. By opening the doors to aiSSEMBLE, Booz Allen is inviting a wave of innovation from all corners — government agencies, universities, nonprofits, and private firms — because some bright sparks out there will undoubtedly create remarkable innovations using aiSSEMBLE, catching Booz Allen’s eye in the process. There’s one kink, though… Booz Allen Hamilton’s own top brass sold shares on May 21, 2024. Those actions were filed with the SEC a day before BHA was scheduled to report earnings. There are eight Form-4s. For those not in the know, a Form-4 is a statement of changes in beneficial ownership of securities by company insiders. But wait a second. Let’s dig deeper. All the Form-4s state they first acquired shares through the vesting of performance-based restricted stock units (RSUs). These RSUs are a form of compensation granted to employees, becoming vested and thereby exercisable or transferable based on achieving specific performance criteria over a set period. In other words, they hit a target — they accomplish a goal — and they’re rewarded with stock. The shares they sold are just a part of the shares acquired. For instance, the CEO — Horacio Rozanski — received 71,575 shares, and he decided to sell 34,571. The EVP & Chief Operating Officer Kristine Anderson acquired 7,544 shares and sold 3,644. Not a single one of them decided to sell the farm and run away. Therefore, they might have sold a portion to cover taxes or diversify their portfolios. This is a common practice and doesn’t necessarily reflect a lack of confidence in the company’s future. Besides, the number of shares sold is minimal compared to the total number they still hold. I told you the CEO sold 34,571 shares, but he is still holding 579,025 more. Kristine sold 3,644, but she still has 72,761. In the end, it is not a red flag. But it was a kink I didn’t appreciate, considering they still decided to sell before earnings. Then again, it’s quite plausible that Booz Allen Hamilton’s top brass might be governed by internal clauses dictating when they can sell their vested shares. After all, many companies have strict trading windows and blackout periods to prevent any appearance of insider trading or conflict of interest. Nonetheless, this was one of the two reasons why I only bought a trunk instead of backing up a Freightliner to load up with shares. How my gambit played out Honestly, there's no point in narrating the play on Reddit since I can't add the entry, premarket charts, profit, or any attachments. So... if you care about how I played this, the link is here. One more insight I learned Booz Allen Hamilton and its helmsman, Horacio Rozanski, aren’t clamoring atop the AI hype train, hollering for investors to crown them the new AI darling everyone should own. Make no mistake, they’re an AI powerhouse. It’s just that they’re not focused on selling the sizzle. In the current world, where companies blare out press releases at the faintest whiff of anything AI-related to entice investors, Booz Allen Hamilton — armed with bona fide credentials — opts to toil diligently away from the limelight. Perhaps it’s by design, though. Considering this is a company that lists its fiscal 2024 revenue with most projects cloaked in secrecy. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here with all their classified contracts. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. So what happens now? I’ve already tipped my hand and no longer hold any BAH shares. My play has come and gone. Considering today's pullback, I bought a small number of September and December calls. Now, after reading this essay, could someone consider investing in Booz Allen Hamilton? Maybe. AI is set to grow, the U.S. government is bound to expand its AI use, and this company is already well-positioned to secure more projects. So, why am I not invested in BAH? Because I’m neither an investor nor a position trader. I’m a short-term swing trader. I played this earnings catalyst, made some profit, and then walked away. Granted, after this deep dive, I’ll keep an eye on BAH and might tag along if she sets up for a northward run. But I know my timeframe. I know my trading style and my limitations. Likewise, it’s up to you to know your trading style and decide what to do with this information. Keep in mind, BAH experienced some volatility selling, and the implied volatility dipped post-earnings and guidance. Probably because some who positioned ahead of earnings were expecting a bigger leap. It’s logical to assume some will take their profits (as we saw today), so don't jump blindly. On the flip side, these earnings mostly flew under the radar. Booz Allen Hamilton remains an AI colossus that most retail traders haven’t even heard of. Besides, do you know how many will actually read this and understand the information? At any rate, now you know what I know. Have a great day.","Hey look, the company that made me some money with their earnings call last week. Thanks for the heads up.",0,0.622,0.993,NEGATIVE

But honestly, you should still learn how to trade, not how to shadow. So why should you read this? That's something you have to decide. Read the title. Only you can decide whether it makes sense to find out more about this company, or not. This is the only image I can post here. 🙁 ❗️ TL;DR: Look here, this essay’s got more words than a politician’s promise, and it doesn't even spoon-feeds you a play. Preposterous! If you’re itching to block me, here’s your guide. Now, if the sheer volume of words is giving you the vapors, I don’t blame you. Just look at this behemoth of text. By golly!

Well, go ahead. Vent away. Hello. Welcome. You should already know that in today's financial markets, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as the golden prodigy, with investors flocking like bees to honey, eagerly snapping up stocks from those trailblazing companies leading the AI revolution. Amidst this fervor, one company stands as the top purveyor of AI services to the U.S. government. Yet, it remains unknown to the general populace. This essay delves into why Booz Allen Hamilton has earned this position, the significant impact of its AI initiatives, and what this means for traders keen to ride the AI boom. Interested? Keep reading, then. ⚠️ WARNING: I originally wrote this research before Booz Allen Hamilton’s fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 results. Fiscal year, not a calendar year.

However, the research is still valid, so I’m posting it here. ⚠️ DISCLAIMER: In their diaphanous wisdom, Reddit/Mods have decreed that posts be limited to a single attachment, which I’ve already used. This essay is adorned with several images to enhance its appeal and, more crucially, includes numerous charts, which I am regrettably unable to include here.

You can continue reading it here on WSB, but be forewarned—you’ll miss out on the visual aids that bring the data to life. The choice, dear reader, is yours. Well now, picture this: The clock has just struck midnight, and today — Friday, May 24, 2024 — has only begun to stretch its legs. I literally just mentioned that I originally wrote this research before Booz Allen Hamilton’s fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 results. Just a few hours ago, I went and bought myself a trunk full of Booz Allen Hamilton shares. And wouldn’t you know it, in just a handful of hours, that very company is set to unveil their earnings report, promising a significant move in the stock, one way or another. Again, I wrote this last week before the earnings. I leaped into this play guided by my trader’s intuition. Now, as I burn the midnight oil, I’m digging into the logic and facts behind that decision. I figured, heck, why not pen an essay about the things I uncover along the way? the number one provider of artificial intelligence (AI) services to the U.S. government. A bit of history Booz Allen Hamilton is no hip upstart. Nope. This institution was founded way back in 1914 by one Edwin G. Booz in the bustling city of Chicago, offering management consulting services before it was even fashionable. During the 1940s, it played a pivotal role in World War II, aiding the U.S. military in improving efficiency and logistics. A decade later, the firm found a niche working with U.S. defense contracts, cementing its reputation as a trusted advisor to Uncle Sam. So why focus on a company named like a law firm? Well, according to GovWin from Deltek — a leading market intelligence organization — Booz Allen is the number one provider of artificial intelligence (AI) services to the U.S. government. And unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’d know that the market currently embraces anything related to artificial intelligence with open arms and a hearty cheer. AI is the belle of the ball. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. For perspective, exactly one year ago (May 24, 2023), NVIDIA had a market capitalization of $760.2 billion. Today, she’s valued at $2.55 trillion. Why? It’s largely due to the insatiably high demand for its AI chips, which are essential for powering advanced AI applications. A reliable uptrend Booz Allen Hamilton boasts a legacy spanning over a century — they consider it 110 years young — but it wasn’t until 2010 that it opened its doors to public investors, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BAH. And if we take a gander at the company’s story as told by its yearly chart, from a humble low of $11.85 in 2012, Booz Allen has steadily climbed the ladder of success, closing today — or yesterday — at $156.83. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Historical yearly performance of Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) stock) here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. That’s a 1,224% ascent, with only a single slightly red year in between, marring the record in 2021. That’s quite the tale of endurance and growth, wouldn’t you say? Aren’t we late to the party, though? Well, Booz Allen Hamilton’s current market capitalization stands at a tidy $20 billion. It’s nothing to scoff at, mind you, but to put things in perspective, this ranks Booz Allen as the 955th most valuable company. There’s still plenty of rungs left to climb on the ladder and ample room for growth down the road. A significant catalyst I’m sharing a monthly chart. Generally speaking, BAH was meandering sideways for nearly three years. That is, until a year ago, on May 26, 2023, to be precise. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Monthly performance of Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) stock.

Following that earnings report, the stock kicked up her heels and went on a 38% run over the next two months. Also, aside from better-than-expected earnings, Booz Allen Hamilton was awarded a $919 million Engineering, Development, Integration, and Technology-based Solutions (EDITS) contract. The contract supports the “Soldier as a System” concept, enhancing warfighter capabilities across multiple Department of Defense (DoD) agencies. The EDITS program promotes collaboration across service boundaries and aims to modernize and equip military tactical units, improving lethality, survivability, and situational awareness. Look at the competition Hold your horses. It’s not just one contract or one project propelling Booz Allen Hamilton skyward. The tide of AI is lifting all boats, so it’s not just one company sailing full steam ahead. Granted, Booz Allen offers a smorgasbord of services, thus facing several competitors in various fields. However, if we narrow our focus to the AI sector, some of the most direct competitors are: Leidos Holdings, Inc.

Again, I wrote this last week before the earnings. I leaped into this play guided by my trader’s intuition. Now, as I burn the midnight oil, I’m digging into the logic and facts behind that decision. I figured, heck, why not pen an essay about the things I uncover along the way? the number one provider of artificial intelligence (AI) services to the U.S. government. A bit of history Booz Allen Hamilton is no hip upstart. Nope. This institution was founded way back in 1914 by one Edwin G. Booz in the bustling city of Chicago, offering management consulting services before it was even fashionable. During the 1940s, it played a pivotal role in World War II, aiding the U.S. military in improving efficiency and logistics. A decade later, the firm found a niche working with U.S. defense contracts, cementing its reputation as a trusted advisor to Uncle Sam. So why focus on a company named like a law firm? Well, according to GovWin from Deltek — a leading market intelligence organization — Booz Allen is the number one provider of artificial intelligence (AI) services to the U.S. government. And unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’d know that the market currently embraces anything related to artificial intelligence with open arms and a hearty cheer. AI is the belle of the ball. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. For perspective, exactly one year ago (May 24, 2023), NVIDIA had a market capitalization of $760.2 billion. Today, she’s valued at $2.55 trillion. Why? It’s largely due to the insatiably high demand for its AI chips, which are essential for powering advanced AI applications. A reliable uptrend Booz Allen Hamilton boasts a legacy spanning over a century — they consider it 110 years young — but it wasn’t until 2010 that it opened its doors to public investors, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BAH. And if we take a gander at the company’s story as told by its yearly chart, from a humble low of $11.85 in 2012, Booz Allen has steadily climbed the ladder of success, closing today — or yesterday — at $156.83. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Historical yearly performance of Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) stock) here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. That’s a 1,224% ascent, with only a single slightly red year in between, marring the record in 2021. That’s quite the tale of endurance and growth, wouldn’t you say? Aren’t we late to the party, though? Well, Booz Allen Hamilton’s current market capitalization stands at a tidy $20 billion. It’s nothing to scoff at, mind you, but to put things in perspective, this ranks Booz Allen as the 955th most valuable company. There’s still plenty of rungs left to climb on the ladder and ample room for growth down the road. A significant catalyst I’m sharing a monthly chart. Generally speaking, BAH was meandering sideways for nearly three years. That is, until a year ago, on May 26, 2023, to be precise. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Monthly performance of Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) stock. The price level illustrates a resistance/support level between August 2020 and May 2023.) here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. Following that earnings report, the stock kicked up her heels and went on a 38% run over the next two months. Also, aside from better-than-expected earnings, Booz Allen Hamilton was awarded a $919 million Engineering, Development, Integration, and Technology-based Solutions (EDITS) contract. The contract supports the “Soldier as a System” concept, enhancing warfighter capabilities across multiple Department of Defense (DoD) agencies. The EDITS program promotes collaboration across service boundaries and aims to modernize and equip military tactical units, improving lethality, survivability, and situational awareness. Look at the competition Hold your horses. It’s not just one contract or one project propelling Booz Allen Hamilton skyward. The tide of AI is lifting all boats, so it’s not just one company sailing full steam ahead. Granted, Booz Allen offers a smorgasbord of services, thus facing several competitors in various fields. However, if we narrow our focus to the AI sector, some of the most direct competitors are: Leidos Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: LDOS) Leidos provides AI and machine learning solutions to various U.S. government agencies, including the Department of Defense (DoD). Their AI capabilities are integrated into solutions for cybersecurity, data analysis, and operational efficiency in defense and intelligence operations. 📈 I'm not allowed to add a chart (Daily performance of Leidos Holdings (LDOS) stock.

As you can see, when earnings roll around, these companies tend to pop and set off on a run northward, much like a hound hot on the trail. Each earnings report can become a potential catalyst, sparking a surge in investor enthusiasm and sending stock prices climbing. That’s what I’m playing. What I played. ----- Other high-profile projects Booz Allen Hamilton is involved in several high-profile projects that leverage AI. Some notable projects include: Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) Booz Allen supports the U.S. Department of Defense’s CJADC2 initiative alongside L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: LHX), which aims to integrate sensors, data, and weapon systems across all military domains — land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace — using AI and machine learning to enhance situational awareness and decision-making capabilities. Project Maven Booz Allen has been a key contractor in Project Maven, an AI program initiated by the Department of Defense, which among other things, aims to analyze video footage from drones using machine learning algorithms to identify objects and patterns, significantly improving intelligence and surveillance operations. Project Linchpin It is the U.S. Army’s first program of record providing an artificial intelligence operations pipeline. It is currently just a $2 million contract to support research and development, but it is anticipated to be followed by subsequent juicier contracts. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. Satellites Booz Allen also made a strategic investment in Albedo, the first company to operate satellites in very low Earth orbit (VLEO), which enables them to offer ultra-high resolution commercial imagery from space. Let’s take a moment to chill because it’s not all black ops and military projects. U.S. Department of Energy On March 12, 2024, Booz Allen Hamilton announced it was awarded a ten-year $550 million contract from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) to support the advancement of high-potential, high-impact, early-stage technologies that generate, store, and use energy in entirely new ways to reduce U.S. emissions, improve energy efficiency, and increase the resiliency and reliability of the U.S. power grid. To give you an idea, ARPA-E is tasked with identifying, shepherding, and accelerating “…the stuff that sounds crazy until it changes the world.” U.S. Environmental Protection Agency On May 8, 2024, the company announced it was awarded a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) to support the agency’s modernization efforts and its mission to protect human health and the environment. Booz Allen won one of four positions on the seven-year Scientific Modeling, Application, Visualization, Computational Science, Software, and Statistical Support (SMAVCS4) BPA, which has a ceiling of $431 million. And many more Booz Allen has nearly 200 active AI projects across defense, national security, and civil missions — including three of the largest AI contracts within the Department of Defense. Understandably, many of them are top secret. 🤐 Late last year, an analyst noted that 2,200 BAH employees are considered ‘AI staff,’ with a staggering 80% holding government security clearances. The company’s AI capabilities are not just extensive but also deeply integrated into sensitive areas of national security. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here.

If your stars align, you might even consider applying for a job since they’re growing and looking to fill a multitude of positions. What analysts are saying In a February research report, William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma mentioned that the outbreak of multiple wars and the artificial intelligence boom “have led to an inflection in government tech hiring and bookings that we feel has some serious legs.” And also, that Booz Allen “remains the government’s go-to source to modernize the military and prepare for conflicts.” In fact, the company “has more backlog than it can handle as government spending has surged on Pacific tensions and AI prototyping.” Finally, this week (May 21, 2024), Stifel raised its price target for BAH to $170 from $155 (from the chart above that you can't see, BAH was $156.83), keeping a buy rating since “AI, cyber and IT modernization remain in focus for the government.” Besides, there have been recently approved federal budget and supplemental spending packages. According to data from William Blair, the analyst sentiment towards Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) is overwhelmingly positive. Not a single soul is suggesting to sell, which paints a promising picture for our tale. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image with the current rating distribution. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. This table could be important to see. Their aiSSEMBLE solution Just recently — on April 30, 2024 — Booz Allen Hamilton announced the launch of aiSSEMBLE Baseline, a first-of-its-kind, open-source solution built to simplify the engineering and deployment of AI systems. Booz Allen Hamilton boasts that aiSSEMBLE is the core tool cementing its status as the leading AI provider to the U.S. federal government. If that’s the case, it suggests that this new foundational code, complete with open-source documentation and free for use by government, academic, nonprofit, and commercial entities, could further extend Booz Allen’s lead. It can also help them with talent acquisition. By opening the doors to aiSSEMBLE, Booz Allen is inviting a wave of innovation from all corners — government agencies, universities, nonprofits, and private firms — because some bright sparks out there will undoubtedly create remarkable innovations using aiSSEMBLE, catching Booz Allen’s eye in the process. There’s one kink, though… Booz Allen Hamilton’s own top brass sold shares on May 21, 2024. Those actions were filed with the SEC a day before BHA was scheduled to report earnings. There are eight Form-4s. For those not in the know, a Form-4 is a statement of changes in beneficial ownership of securities by company insiders. But wait a second. Let’s dig deeper. All the Form-4s state they first acquired shares through the vesting of performance-based restricted stock units (RSUs). These RSUs are a form of compensation granted to employees, becoming vested and thereby exercisable or transferable based on achieving specific performance criteria over a set period. In other words, they hit a target — they accomplish a goal — and they’re rewarded with stock. The shares they sold are just a part of the shares acquired. For instance, the CEO — Horacio Rozanski — received 71,575 shares, and he decided to sell 34,571. The EVP & Chief Operating Officer Kristine Anderson acquired 7,544 shares and sold 3,644. Not a single one of them decided to sell the farm and run away. Therefore, they might have sold a portion to cover taxes or diversify their portfolios. This is a common practice and doesn’t necessarily reflect a lack of confidence in the company’s future. Besides, the number of shares sold is minimal compared to the total number they still hold. I told you the CEO sold 34,571 shares, but he is still holding 579,025 more. Kristine sold 3,644, but she still has 72,761. In the end, it is not a red flag. But it was a kink I didn’t appreciate, considering they still decided to sell before earnings. Then again, it’s quite plausible that Booz Allen Hamilton’s top brass might be governed by internal clauses dictating when they can sell their vested shares. After all, many companies have strict trading windows and blackout periods to prevent any appearance of insider trading or conflict of interest. Nonetheless, this was one of the two reasons why I only bought a trunk instead of backing up a Freightliner to load up with shares. How my gambit played out Honestly, there's no point in narrating the play on Reddit since I can't add the entry, premarket charts, profit, or any attachments. So... if you care about how I played this, the link is here. One more insight I learned Booz Allen Hamilton and its helmsman, Horacio Rozanski, aren’t clamoring atop the AI hype train, hollering for investors to crown them the new AI darling everyone should own. Make no mistake, they’re an AI powerhouse. It’s just that they’re not focused on selling the sizzle. In the current world, where companies blare out press releases at the faintest whiff of anything AI-related to entice investors, Booz Allen Hamilton — armed with bona fide credentials — opts to toil diligently away from the limelight. Perhaps it’s by design, though. Considering this is a company that lists its fiscal 2024 revenue with most projects cloaked in secrecy. 🖼️ I'm not allowed to add an image here with all their classified contracts. If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. So what happens now? I’ve already tipped my hand and no longer hold any BAH shares. My play has come and gone. Considering today's pullback, I bought a small number of September and December calls. Now, after reading this essay, could someone consider investing in Booz Allen Hamilton? Maybe. AI is set to grow, the U.S. government is bound to expand its AI use, and this company is already well-positioned to secure more projects. So, why am I not invested in BAH? Because I’m neither an investor nor a position trader. I’m a short-term swing trader. I played this earnings catalyst, made some profit, and then walked away. Granted, after this deep dive, I’ll keep an eye on BAH and might tag along if she sets up for a northward run. But I know my timeframe. I know my trading style and my limitations. Likewise, it’s up to you to know your trading style and decide what to do with this information. Keep in mind, BAH experienced some volatility selling, and the implied volatility dipped post-earnings and guidance. Probably because some who positioned ahead of earnings were expecting a bigger leap. It’s logical to assume some will take their profits (as we saw today), so don't jump blindly. On the flip side, these earnings mostly flew under the radar. Booz Allen Hamilton remains an AI colossus that most retail traders haven’t even heard of. Besides, do you know how many will actually read this and understand the information? At any rate, now you know what I know. Have a great day.",What in the fucking world is this?

,"My deep dive on Booz Allen Hamilton’s AI dominance and what it means for traders I'm sharing my research so YOU can make a better decision. I know many members prefer to be told what to buy, but this is an essay, not a BanBet. My current BanBet record is 31-20, which is so-so. But honestly, you should still learn how to trade, not how to shadow. So why should you read this? That's something you have to decide. Read the title. Only you can decide whether it makes sense to find out more about this company, or not. This is the only image I can post here. 🙁 ❗️ TL;DR: Look here, this essay’s got more words than a politician’s promise, and it doesn't even spoon-feeds you a play. Preposterous! If you’re itching to block me, here’s your guide. Now, if the sheer volume of words is giving you the vapors, I don’t blame you. Just look at this behemoth of text. By golly! Let’s face it: you don’t really want to be here, and you’re likely not my audience (folks who actually enjoy reading and/or appreciate knowledge). So, I’d just as soon see you off. Sure, you could go outside and indulge in memes, but I wager you’ve got a primal need to scroll down and leave a gripe about how absurd it is to expect anyone to wade through this verbosity. Well, go ahead. Vent away. Hello. Welcome. You should already know that in today's financial markets, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as the golden prodigy, with investors flocking like bees to honey, eagerly snapping up stocks from those trailblazing companies leading the AI revolution. Amidst this fervor, one company stands as the top purveyor of AI services to the U.S. government. Yet, it remains unknown to the general populace. This essay delves into why Booz Allen Hamilton has earned this position, the significant impact of its AI initiatives, and what this means for traders keen to ride the AI boom. Interested? Keep reading, then. ⚠️ WARNING: I originally wrote this research before Booz Allen Hamilton’s fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 results. Fiscal year, not a calendar year. And I did share my findings with other traders on time. If you are reading this now, that event is already in the past. However, the research is still valid, so I’m posting it here. ⚠️ DISCLAIMER: In their diaphanous wisdom, Reddit/Mods have decreed that posts be limited to a single attachment, which I’ve already used.

If you want to see the essay without this limitation, here's the link. So what happens now? I’ve already tipped my hand and no longer hold any BAH shares. My play has come and gone. Considering today's pullback, I bought a small number of September and December calls. Now, after reading this essay, could someone consider investing in Booz Allen Hamilton? Maybe. AI is set to grow, the U.S. government is bound to expand its AI use, and this company is already well-positioned to secure more projects. So, why am I not invested in BAH? Because I’m neither an investor nor a position trader. I’m a short-term swing trader. I played this earnings catalyst, made some profit, and then walked away. Granted, after this deep dive, I’ll keep an eye on BAH and might tag along if she sets up for a northward run. But I know my timeframe. I know my trading style and my limitations. Likewise, it’s up to you to know your trading style and decide what to do with this information. Keep in mind, BAH experienced some volatility selling, and the implied volatility dipped post-earnings and guidance. Probably because some who positioned ahead of earnings were expecting a bigger leap. It’s logical to assume some will take their profits (as we saw today), so don't jump blindly. On the flip side, these earnings mostly flew under the radar. Booz Allen Hamilton remains an AI colossus that most retail traders haven’t even heard of. Besides, do you know how many will actually read this and understand the information? At any rate, now you know what I know. Have a great day.","No, not at all.Go outside.
