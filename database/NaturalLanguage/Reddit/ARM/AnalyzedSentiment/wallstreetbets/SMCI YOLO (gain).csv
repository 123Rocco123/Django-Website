,Is this regarded enough? Made money. But I was down 50% shortly after buying this… Never doing that again…,"I bought some calls for SMCI thinking it will go up after it dumped when trading opened. The ‘break even’ price does not mean anything on options and you can be in major profit way before you hit that number.Anyways basically I bought 300 shares on a pure interest loan at a fraction of the cost. I bought 3 contracts and each contract is 100 shares for about $9,000. If I would’ve bought the shares out right (spot trade) then it would’ve cost me about $220,000 at $735 a share. So I bought them on contract at $9,000. Now as the value of the stock goes up I basically get the same return as if I bought $220,000 worth of the stock, except I only spent $9,000. It dosent exactly work like that but you get the idea.Now if the stock was to go below like $675 then my $9,000 would be worth $0 and I loose everything. The upside is if the stock would go to say $1200 then I would’ve made $100,000Hope that helps.",1,0.548,1.0,NEGATIVE
