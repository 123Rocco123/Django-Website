Really wild day to say the least...","The reasons were:Sp500 hit 5500, the same way NVDA sold off on March 7th when it hit 5250Important smaller indexes/ETFs hit their upper bound in terms of price and RSI: -SOXX at 256 hit two trendlines, and daily RSI14 75 above which it gets only once a year or so, -PHLX SOX hit RSI 78 at which it always corrects -XLK hit major TL since X 22 and rsi of 80,5. Strangely Accenture results must have thrown it over the edge. -Nasdaq Composite: upper bound of a recent trendline (since mid May) and RSI of 80 at which it has always corrected except 2010,17,18 in the last 15 years.XLK rebalancing > selling the news (it's just 12% of average daily turnover and I see many people misunderstood how it's spread)AAII and II sentiment indicator became borderlineToo many brag posts about NVDA on WSB/IG/random news.For too many data center/semis stock the same indicators became way out of line or right on the extreme edge (MU!)6B. Also many tech stocks, esp. those more volatile and the whole Communication segment was in downward trend for a few weeks/months now7.
