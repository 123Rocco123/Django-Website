Let's hope Qualcomm moons before this bubble pops","It's priced in at this point. This chip won't move the future stock price either way.2 months ago when I wrote that comment, it may not have been. But now that the specs are posted on Qualcomm's website, and there's Tom's Hardware benchmarks... yeah. It's all public information now.",4,0.543,1.0,NEGATIVE

,"Would be lying if I said I knew what all this tech means, but there's alot of articles about this Snapdragon ARM processor. More Qualcomm Calls here I come. Let's hope Qualcomm moons before this bubble pops","Apple already uses Qualcomm modems because they can't produce better ones them self. If the chips are significantly better, who's to say they don't start using them or maybe Microsoft gets an edge by useing the chips. Having a good product can't be a bad thing even if apple would never use it",1,0.519,0.906,NEGATIVE
,"Would be lying if I said I knew what all this tech means, but there's alot of articles about this Snapdragon ARM processor. More Qualcomm Calls here I come. Let's hope Qualcomm moons before this bubble pops",I’m happy for Qualcomm and its non-Apple customers. I’m just saying the M3 or other Apple chip is going to have to suck pretty bad for Apple to use non-Apple chips,2,0.523,0.797,POSITIVE
,"Would be lying if I said I knew what all this tech means, but there's alot of articles about this Snapdragon ARM processor. More Qualcomm Calls here I come. Let's hope Qualcomm moons before this bubble pops","MacBooks became successful cause Intel sucks. They loud, hot, poor batterylife. Qualcomm could kill Intel outdated CPUs and become Apples ultrabook competitor. Apple knows they're fucked that's why they bringing games to Mac.",3,0.512,1.0,NEGATIVE

Let's hope Qualcomm moons before this bubble pops",And they just opensourced 80+ AI models. The models are curated and optimized for their chips. In order for consumers to fully benefit from AI it will be necessary to scale down models to enable running them on low cost devices. High compute / GPUs is not an approach to solve each and every problem.https://aihub.qualcomm.com/Waiting for a dip.,0,0.536,0.994,NEGATIVE
,"Would be lying if I said I knew what all this tech means, but there's alot of articles about this Snapdragon ARM processor. More Qualcomm Calls here I come. Let's hope Qualcomm moons before this bubble pops",doubt.they have tried to put ARM in laptops and no one buys them. Intel or AMD and Apple and only reason apple is in the conversation is people like buying trendy products.,0,0.548,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"Would be lying if I said I knew what all this tech means, but there's alot of articles about this Snapdragon ARM processor. More Qualcomm Calls here I come. Let's hope Qualcomm moons before this bubble pops","Apples arm chip is a better laptop cpu than x86. But PCs have the legacy software problem. So no ones going to move to a platform with no software. And no ones going to write software for a platform with no users. Apple controls their whole tech stack so they're in a unique position to be able to just dictate that the whole platform and all its software uses a new architecture now. And they wrote a pretty good emulator to run legacy x86 code. Apple have made an architecture change a few times in the past. I think it's fairly obvious that x86 will be replaced by arm or something similar on PC in the near future as well, as x86 is very old and arm is much more efficient. Efficiency always wins in the end because you can do more computing within the same thermal limit. Apples just the first to move due to their aforementioned control over their whole tech stack. I think its likely amd will be the next one building high power arm cpus and maybe nvidia. The problem with arm on pc so far is no one besides apple have built a particularly high power one. This will change, again especially if amd gets into it",1,0.536,0.91,POSITIVE
,"Would be lying if I said I knew what all this tech means, but there's alot of articles about this Snapdragon ARM processor. More Qualcomm Calls here I come. Let's hope Qualcomm moons before this bubble pops",Qualcomm is the biggest chip manufacturer for phones and yes it uses ARM Architecture like apple for its chips,0,0.515,0.998,POSITIVE
,"Would be lying if I said I knew what all this tech means, but there's alot of articles about this Snapdragon ARM processor. More Qualcomm Calls here I come. Let's hope Qualcomm moons before this bubble pops",exactly they will sell in phones but not in laptops. no one is buying a laptop that runs on android. and even if they run windows no one is buying and ARM cpu.just look at the struggle google has selling chromebooks.,1,0.515,0.998,NEGATIVE
,"Would be lying if I said I knew what all this tech means, but there's alot of articles about this Snapdragon ARM processor. More Qualcomm Calls here I come. Let's hope Qualcomm moons before this bubble pops","I made a few posts on various subs, you can easily deduct that it has similar performance as the M3 (also amd flagship laptop cpu)",0,0.558,0.778,POSITIVE
,"Would be lying if I said I knew what all this tech means, but there's alot of articles about this Snapdragon ARM processor. More Qualcomm Calls here I come. Let's hope Qualcomm moons before this bubble pops",meanwhile M4 is probably around the corner,0,0.512,0.989,NEGATIVE
