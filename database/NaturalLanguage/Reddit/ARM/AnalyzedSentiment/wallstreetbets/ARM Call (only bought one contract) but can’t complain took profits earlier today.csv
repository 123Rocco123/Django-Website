,,You do know one contract is 100 shares right?,1,0.578,0.963,NEGATIVE
,,Nope. So how much did it cost you. And how did you make a x10 ? Markets don't do x10,2,0.538,0.988,NEGATIVE
,,"Basically options are magnified exposure, instead of 100% value per share as in for example pay $50 for a stock with a price per share $50. You pay a fraction of that, say $5 which 10% is whatever profit/loss takes place is 10x higher, you pay $5 per share for a contract filled with 100 shares, that's minimum. So you end up paying $500 for that contract. The 100 shares on their own actually cost $5000 not $500.",3,0.566,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,So if the price decrease by 10% you loose all ? If i understand well,4,0.532,0.973,NEGATIVE
,,"You buy an option contract from the option chain, that option chain dictates the price for trade. First you are seeing a lot more than a 10% move on that screenshot, you are seeing huge market price move and consequently higher trade price for those option contracts. If market price goes down, the options will become cheaper, however cheaper in this case means that you can sell them for less than you bought them at. It doesn't mean that automatically you lose everything. You only lose everything if the options are not valid anymore, when they have expired and you haven't done anything with them. You can sell them or execute them, execution or exercise is something else entirely, typically none of these people here exercise options. They just sell them when the premium price for them in option chain is higher. Exercise means that you are willing to buy 100 shares at the chosen strike price if the strike price is reached, buy with new cash. That's what a call option is.",5,0.537,1.0,NEGATIVE
