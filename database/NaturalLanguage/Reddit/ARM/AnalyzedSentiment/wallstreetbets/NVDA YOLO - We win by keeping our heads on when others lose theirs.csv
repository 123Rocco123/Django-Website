At the moment we've got a handful of companies beating expectations because of AI revenue (good for Nvidia, long-term), and some beating CapEx expectations because of AI spending (good for Nvidia, short-term) The current situation Look at Nvidia P/E compared to its share price. We're halfway through the year. At the end of this fiscal year, Nvidia will be worth $180 at the midline of this trend. It is currently $113. That is a 57% return, 157% on an annualized basis. Nvidia is down 17% from its peak. Its hard to call the bottom, but yesterday we saw a major flash crash followed by a v back up. Much like the opposite of the ""blow-off"" tops that we see when the bull runs peak. Big volume selling, big volume buying. Big down, big up. I expect the fast bears used that to get out.

They say they are expecting $0.59 per share. But last quarter Nvidia made that, on the back of 26B in revenue. For this quarter, Nvidia predicted 28B revenue. If they hit that, we're looking at $0.66. But of course they're being conservative. Why wouldn't they? When your growth is 262% you have plenty of room to estimate conservatively. How conservative are they usually? Last time they predicted 24B and hit 26B. If roughly that amount extra happens again, we're looking at 30B in revenue and $0.70 in profit.

You can't have this kind of transformation without people getting overexcited for a few years. But we aren't at that stage yet. Look at how long the dotcom bubble took, and more importantly, look how the late stage was characterized - explosion of IPOs. Until we get a flood of IPOs, we aren't in the late stage. Until we see an IPO for SexRobots Inc, we aren't in the late stage. At the moment we've got a handful of companies beating expectations because of AI revenue (good for Nvidia, long-term), and some beating CapEx expectations because of AI spending (good for Nvidia, short-term) The current situation Look at Nvidia P/E compared to its share price. We're halfway through the year. At the end of this fiscal year, Nvidia will be worth $180 at the midline of this trend. It is currently $113. That is a 57% return, 157% on an annualized basis. Nvidia is down 17% from its peak. Its hard to call the bottom, but yesterday we saw a major flash crash followed by a v back up. Much like the opposite of the ""blow-off"" tops that we see when the bull runs peak. Big volume selling, big volume buying. Big down, big up. I expect the fast bears used that to get out. The slow ones will watch their profits start eroding before also bailing and taking their gains. The slower ones will hit their stop losses, and the slowest will drift back into the red. If you're a bear in the green, take the W and get out Upcoming catalysts Other company earnings next week - MSFT, META, SNAP, AMD, ARM Upcoming earnings What are the market expectations for next earnings? They say they are expecting $0.59 per share. But last quarter Nvidia made that, on the back of 26B in revenue. For this quarter, Nvidia predicted 28B revenue. If they hit that, we're looking at $0.66. But of course they're being conservative. Why wouldn't they? When your growth is 262% you have plenty of room to estimate conservatively. How conservative are they usually? Last time they predicted 24B and hit 26B. If roughly that amount extra happens again, we're looking at 30B in revenue and $0.70 in profit. My positions $100 call 8/16 expiration (bought +20 for $32,000) Don't do what I do. Buy a longer expiration.","Good post.
