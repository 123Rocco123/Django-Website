,,"Qualcomm is a legal firm with an engineering department. Pretty sure they are down to fight this one.Funny thing is what happens if ARM wins. The idea that ARM allows AAPL to use the ISA to design cores but wouldn't allow QCOM to do so would immediately open up the FRAND (Fair, Reasonable, and Non-discriminatory) question about the entire instruction set IP.This case ends with a large payment from QCOM to ARM.",0,0.514,0.993,NEGATIVE
,,This case ends with lawyers making a bunch of money and eventual settlement with no money exchanged.ARM has to make it look like they‚Äôre trying for their shareholders but they can‚Äôt fuck over their 5G biz.,1,0.509,0.941,NEGATIVE
,,Qualcomm is the end game for all patents. Dont like it? No 5G for you,0,0.503,0.514,NEGATIVE
,,Qualcomm has the patents on that too.Seriously if it‚Äôs wireless Qualcomm has the essential patent - doesn‚Äôt mater what it is.,2,0.496,0.518,POSITIVE
,,"Haha - Apple spent billions buying the Intel modem business for 5G. Even they are yet to figure out a way to be as good as the Qualcomm designs.5 years later, Apple is still using Qualcomm while still investing loads of money to try work it out.",2,0.528,0.529,NEGATIVE
,,You want to invent 6G? You definitely cannot get around some of the 4G/5G patents! Qualcomm will get you covered.,2,0.506,0.625,NEGATIVE
,,ARM said they want all Snapdragon laptops destroyed - DAMN lol,0,0.601,0.999,NEGATIVE
,,Qualcomm is a much bigger patent troll than ARM.It‚Äôs guaranteed that ARM is using Qualcomm IP.This thing is going to settle - if it doesn‚Äôt ARM is going to end up getting slapped around really hard.,0,0.511,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,ARM has the copyright on the ARM instruction set. The US has already said that instruction sets are basically un-copyrightable (Intel vs AMD) so they‚Äôre already on shaky ground.Qualcomm has essentially all the patents for mobile technologies plus plenty of others (they have 263k patents).The entire ARM 5G portfolio depends on Qualcomm patents.This thing settles or Qualcomm bends ARM over.,2,0.545,0.995,NEGATIVE
,,You definitely belong here.,4,0.5,1.0,POSITIVE
,,"No, it‚Äôs bagholder copium.The only thing that Qualcomm has licensed in the ISA. That‚Äôs the only thing Qualcomm cares about. ARM is claiming that license didn‚Äôt follow the purchase which would have to be a very specific clause in the contract that specifically made it non-transferable since transferability of contracts is assumed.On the other hand ARM hasn‚Äôt done jack shit in terms of growing their business value in the last 15 years dumping a shitload of money into IoT while being passed up by folks making their own cores in enterprise and mobile.While ARM is suing around something barely copyright able, based on what would have to be highly unusual contract terms, against a company with a patent portfolio that would cripple ARM if they were to revoke licenses.This gets settled - ARM is unhappy with people making ARM processors that aren‚Äôt based on their IP so they‚Äôre losing out on a shitload of money their stockholders are getting pissed about.It‚Äôs going to be real fun if they try suing Apple too.",6,0.531,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"Man you seem confused. ARM sells IP, Nvidia sells chips (manufactured by tsmc).",2,0.52,0.956,NEGATIVE
,,"You really don‚Äôt understand anything you‚Äôre talking about.TSMC manufactures the chips on contract with nvidia, nvidia sells them to their customers.Sure you might have a slight argument if you were to say that TSMC just turned around and started mass selling the chips themselves - but that ignores a shitload of factors and it‚Äôs not an apples to apples comparison. Qualcomm isn‚Äôt using a chip design from ARM - they‚Äôre just using the ISA.",4,0.526,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,They do not.,6,0.5,0.93,NEGATIVE
,,"Oof you're real deep in confidently incorrect here. Msi very specifically does not make the gpu chipset. Nvidia doesn't either. Nvidia designs it, tsmc makes it and board partners like msi use a design layout from Nvidia with their own msi flavor packet sprinkled on to create the finished product.",6,0.528,0.898,NEGATIVE
,,"They are not licensing gpu's lol, they buy it form Nvidia and put it. Wth op, you don't even have basic knowledge do belong even in wsb",4,0.528,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,The do pay a license and royalty. Look it up,5,0.506,0.894,POSITIVE
,,"No precisely not. If you go to Nvidia you get a rectangular pice of silicone and some instructions what to connect to each pin to, for the chip to do its magic. You don't know how they do it.If you go to ARM, they tell you exactly how to do it, and even help you customize it to your needs.",4,0.52,0.995,NEGATIVE
,,Lol you think Nvidia doesn't provide support and customization. Have you seen there presentations. I work with nvidia chips it's more than instructions it's an entire stack. Including the sdk and software.,5,0.539,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,Yea for USING it. Good luck dissecting a die with >200 Billion transistors in 3nm and reverse engineering it.The sdk and reference board designs will not help you in any way.You'd need am elctron microscope and probably more time than feasible and still you'd have the problem that nobody would manufacture that for you.,6,0.518,0.688,NEGATIVE

,,"Son, I know more than your mama knows about your tiny wee and your bad breath",5,0.507,0.91,POSITIVE
,,What you are saying is Qualcomm own the IP and ARM pretend to license out to everyone else. I don't think you understand how the industry works.,1,0.51,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,Funny enough since you couldn‚Äôt figure out what I was saying it‚Äôs pretty obvious you don‚Äôt.Qualcomm licenses an instruction set from ARM. ARM also licenses implementations to people. Qualcomm has 263k patents spanning everything in mobile. Not only does ARM have an entire 5g product line (you can‚Äôt touch 5g without licensing Qualcomm patents) but the chances that their core implementations don‚Äôt step on a Qualcomm patent is pretty small as well.,2,0.519,0.992,POSITIVE
,,Except they bought a company expecting their agreements to be transferred with it. That is the part you clearly couldn't figure out.,3,0.587,0.98,NEGATIVE
,,You need to retake contract law.,4,0.555,0.995,NEGATIVE
,,I don't need to re-take anything. That is how ARM operates.,5,0.509,0.919,NEGATIVE

,,"What, so this settles and one of them drops a little and the other fucking tanks.Nice hedge brother üòé",2,0.505,0.622,NEGATIVE
,,"If the contract doesn‚Äôt have terms saying it‚Äôs a non-transferable contract then it‚Äôs just bullshit and ARM is trying to change contract and tax law.Contracts that an entity have, by precedent, are assumed by the new owner.",0,0.552,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"If the contract doesn‚Äôt have terms saying it‚Äôs a non-transferable contract then it‚Äôs just bullshit and ARM is trying to change contract and tax law.Contracts that an entity have, by precedent, are assumed by the new owner.",1,0.552,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"Yep, this is what no one seems to understand. The fight by the lawyers will be ‚Äúwhen is it actually being considered transferred‚Äù.Buying a company with the contract doesn‚Äôt actually transfer the contract. But nuvia selling off the contract itself to another company would be trying to transfer it.Those two points I‚Äôm betting is the real argument here.",2,0.582,0.991,NEGATIVE
,,Depends on what you mean by transferred.The contract by default stays with the entity that entered into the contract so when that entity is purchased the owner now assumes the contract - so the contract would have to have terms that specifically terminated on certain conditions such as the entity ownership changing.ARM trying to argue that whatever was developed by Nuvia under the contract couldn‚Äôt be transferred with the company is really sketchy without a lot of very specific language in it.To me it looks like ARM getting butthurt about people with better processors than them. Suing those people because they have better shit is a straight up Intel type move.,3,0.54,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"So, it does not have the term ""non-transferable""?",2,0.528,0.988,NEGATIVE
,,"You have it the wrong way. QCOM acquires Nuvia, who had ALA with ARM which a much higher royalty rate because they were designing server chips and they are much smaller than a QCOM and can get slapped around by ARM.QCOM acquires them. QCOM already has a ALA with ARM for their mobile chips with a lower royalty to ARM. QCOM then asserts they will pay royalties under their existing ALA because it covers their chips and they are pivoting Nuvia tech from server to mobile.Now we are seeing the fruits of the acquisition with the imminent release of the new mobile chips. Frankly, I don‚Äôt see why QCOM should pay a higher royalty to ARM under the Nuvia agreement given these aren‚Äôt server chips, more of the same from QCOM, just expanding into what type of device they are in.",1,0.531,0.959,NEGATIVE
,,does it not depend on what chip it actually is and what the agreement with QCOM was?,2,0.575,0.997,NEGATIVE
,,"That‚Äôs the argument, innit?Qualcomm says no, it doesn‚Äôt matter because they already had an ALA that also covered server chips (remember, they briefly tried to enter the market before killing the effort) and, upon acquiring Nuvia, Nuvia essentially became Qualcomm so it‚Äôs all the same.ARM says it does matter and they can‚Äôt use the technology Nuvia developed under their ALA pre-acquisition in their Snapdragon chips.All I‚Äôll say is that Qualcomm is one of the best, if not the best, companies at navigating IP rights, licenses, etc. Heck, they beat Apple‚Ä¶",3,0.532,0.677,NEGATIVE
,,Mossimo beat Apple. lol so...,4,0.518,0.939,POSITIVE
,,I know you‚Äôre being blas√® but those two aren‚Äôt even in the same universe of litigation. Apple was essentially trying to kill Qualcomm by invalidating its most important patents.,5,0.512,0.964,NEGATIVE
,,Why does everybody dislike QCOM? Patent trolling gone wild. Interesting anyways. I hope they can just settle and resolve. Good for everyone,6,0.508,0.82,POSITIVE
,,"You have it wrong, arm extracted higher revenue if nuvia ever made it to servers. They don't like that Qualcomm is using Qualcomm license but using server cores without paying server license money",1,0.513,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,Qualcomm‚Äôs older license covers all markets as they were also going to make a foray into enterprise but opted out as it wasn‚Äôt going well.,2,0.544,0.99,NEGATIVE
,,"Yup exactly, this is just pure extortion from. ARM for speaking against Nvidia merger",3,0.525,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"No, you are not. ARM license to a specific company only. If said company is taken over the agreement can't be transferred.",1,0.787,0.997,NEGATIVE
,,My AAPL calls like this.,0,0.508,0.948,POSITIVE
,,"ARM are the ones that design the base and then license that out to everyone. NDVA, APPL, INTC, SMSN, AMD and, obviously, QCOM. All licensing ARM IPWhen they license ARM IP that agreement is between those two specific companies only. Nothing is transferable.",0,0.551,0.983,NEGATIVE
,,I agree what's your point,1,0.502,0.692,POSITIVE
,,If you agree you should know what the point is. I wasn't arguing against you. I read some of the comments and decided a lot of people on here don't understand what goes on in licensing IP,2,0.505,0.52,POSITIVE
,,Change of ownership of an entity doesn‚Äôt invalidate the contract that entity has unless there is very specific terms in the contract saying that change of ownership invalidates the contract.The later would be highly unusual - a company founded as a startup with venture capital where the entire point is to be able to exit having a clause that terminates the product line if the company has a change of ownership event would have caused their lawyer to go apeshit.,3,0.563,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"There are two options - license the ISA (a 200ish page PDF) or license a core.Apple, Qualcomm, etc license the ISA and design the cores themselves. The Supreme Court has all but invalidated copyrights on ISAs with their x86 ruling regarding Intel and AMD so if this case goes far enough you might see ARM‚Äôs ISA royalties disappear entirely.ARM doesn‚Äôt like that Apple and Qualcomm are making better cores than they are. It puts a pall over their entire business of licensing developed cores to companies.",1,0.528,0.991,NEGATIVE
,,"You appear to be mistaken. Qualcomm designs their own chips, they license the ISA from arm but do not use the off the shelf designs from arm. In fact you should read the article you linked. Arm wants Qualcomm to destroy Qualcomm designed chips. That would be a pretty ridiculous demand if Qualcomm did not have their own designs, wouldn't it?",0,0.509,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,No they don't. Or it wouldn't be ARM,1,0.515,0.919,NEGATIVE
