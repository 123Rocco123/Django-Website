,"BITX is a BTC futures 2x leveraged ETF. I had a rebalance set for Friday at 3 that I forgot to confirm. Would have made my average entry at $45.9 and would have been 700 shares.

Not impossible, but it assumes that the publisher c, immutable ledger has been adopted internationally as the new reserve commodity.Some say BTC goes to those astronomical levels or to 0. It achieves it's end goal of breaking central banks or it gets stomped out.I lean that way. I think 100 k after halving. Then, I presume some ranging action on an accent to 250k before next Summer. If we hit 100k before Summer, then we hit 200k by Christmas.I don't think a million by 2030 is unreasonable. I don't think a billion by 2038 is unreasonable if a few assumptions about GL bal instability pan out.But at that point, we have hyperinflation.",3,0.532,0.992,NEGATIVE

I dumped in on the front end and should have stayed with my daily buy strategy.I am now almost $100k in. What I didn't realize is this started paying decent dividends a few months ago. It's been at a rate of 25-30% annually adjusted as yield.Still waiting for a boom. I did allocate more over on dips across four accounts.I've got 2161 shares at a total cost of $96,180 across four accounts for a total average buy in of $44.31.Paper loss of $43,000 is no fun, but the dividends are reinvested to lower my buy in regularly.So if we crab walk without too much decay, either the dividend DCA makes up the difference but we more or less earn about 4% monthly in dividends to reinvest and grow the position or we climb faster and grow the position slower.Paper math suggests I need an 80% gain on BITX from here to break even. That implies a 40% gain on BTC.I don't think it's a straight 1:2 pattern. On spikes it's more. We hit basically 60, 50, 40, and 30 on the way down from the spikes in the spring. If BTC flies it will be wild, but I'm now less certain about price appreciation on account of the dividends but position appreciation is definitely noteworthy.As of open or market they had $1.399 billion in cash, 5566 contracts of Sept futures and 4023 contracts of October futures.
