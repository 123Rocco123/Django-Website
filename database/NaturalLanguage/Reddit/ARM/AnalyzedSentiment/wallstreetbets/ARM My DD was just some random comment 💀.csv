,"Saw a random comment saying that they noticed an unusual amount of leaps around $73, and so I said aight bet. I can't recall who it was, thank you random stranger.","In this market right now SMCI is surprising everyone including me. Broadcom is still great.For me, what attracted me to ARM was that once in a lifetime moment where a stock is at it's infancy and you(me) have the money to actual get in. Too young for Apple, Bitcoin, Microsoft, Wallmart, Tesla 10 years ago, on and on. ARM was that clarity for me.Its upside is pure. If a monopoly exists they are it. RISC-V is a thing so be good to watch out for that. But 99.99% smartphone penetration is ridiculous.Now with all of that throw AI and edge AI on there and it's just game over. This is the Nvidia moment and you are welcome to still come on board.For next stocks, To me these companies aren't out yet but if Starlink was a thing that would interesting. And if GPT somehow ever goes public I would bet my children, wife, and house on that completely. Like I would give everything I know to invest in that.The new guard is coming and it's spelled with 2 letters.AI",4,0.539,0.619,NEGATIVE
,"Saw a random comment saying that they noticed an unusual amount of leaps around $73, and so I said aight bet. I can't recall who it was, thank you random stranger.",“In it’s infancy”? The company that was created in the 80s and was public from late 90s for over 15 years?They may be pervasive now but risc-v and similar will be the end of them. They stagnated last time and will stagnate again.Remind me in 20 years and gloat about how many millions you made.. I’m just bitter about the first public outing.,5,0.544,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"Saw a random comment saying that they noticed an unusual amount of leaps around $73, and so I said aight bet. I can't recall who it was, thank you random stranger.",Lol I get you're bitter so it's ok.risc-V is not a risc with Arm having ~7000 patents.

Did you see Samsungs last Ultra phone release with embedded AI or their double/triple screen phones. There is 13 new V9 Arm chips in those phones. They doubled their royalties on that.He sandbagged and nobody listened.Back to Her.

,"Saw a random comment saying that they noticed an unusual amount of leaps around $73, and so I said aight bet. I can't recall who it was, thank you random stranger.",If you have calls that gives you the right to buy shares at the strike price. So say you have a strike of $73 for this example. If the stock goes to $100 in the after/pre market you can sell the equivalent number of shares and then you’ve synthetically closed your position.Why is that? Because you have an option that gives you a long position at $73 if you exercise and you have a short position at $100.You likely need a margin account for that though.,3,0.543,1.0,NEGATIVE
