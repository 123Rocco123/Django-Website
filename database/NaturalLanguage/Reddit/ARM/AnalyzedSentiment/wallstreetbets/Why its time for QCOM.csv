,"Fellow degenerates, Qualcomm (QCOM) already is a huge established player in the mobile chip market - it pretty much has a monopoly if you ignore Apple. Their P/E ratio is 21.40 in comparison to AMD's 88 and Nvidia's 93. It's fucking cheap. But I hear you think, who cares about these mobile phone chips with their gimmicky AI features. No one is talking about the following, and I think Qualcomm can be a gem. So besides them being already established in the phone market, nobody is talking about the following: 1. Qualcomm shaking up the CPU market Qualcomm is about to turn the Windows CPU market into its personal playground. It's going to be bringing ARM chips (yes, the technology that made Apple's M chips insanely superior over these shitty windows chips as they are so much more expensive). No one wants to walk around with these fugly thick windows laptops, Qualcomm is going to be the first one to change it and will have the first mover advantage. Even if they dont win the market, the market is growing insanely fast and is huge (the pie is big enough..). Qualcomm has good connections with TSMC (who produces their / apples chips).. It's a nobrainer. I did the math on another post, simply comparing benchmarks shows that they have a fair shot at apple's M3. Meaning - thin windows laptops with insane increases in battery life. No more jet engine sounds. 2. Inference chips (actually a contender for nvidia.. and nobody is talking about this) You have AI 100 cards, which do the actual AI heavy lifting (and not the bullshit gimmicky phone AI stuff) in AI/data centers. They are making the AI 100 Ultra. It's a serious contender for nvidia's H100 and benchmark info is available online. 3. The AI hype potential Besides all the prior I mentioned, it being underpriced, already fundamentally a good company but also going to singlehandedly turn the windows laptops (and desktop) market upside down.. in addition to competing with nvidia in the AI inference world..

Qualcomm shaking up the CPU market Qualcomm is about to turn the Windows CPU market into its personal playground. It's going to be bringing ARM chips (yes, the technology that made Apple's M chips insanely superior over these shitty windows chips as they are so much more expensive). No one wants to walk around with these fugly thick windows laptops, Qualcomm is going to be the first one to change it and will have the first mover advantage. Even if they dont win the market, the market is growing insanely fast and is huge (the pie is big enough..). Qualcomm has good connections with TSMC (who produces their / apples chips).. It's a nobrainer. I did the math on another post, simply comparing benchmarks shows that they have a fair shot at apple's M3. Meaning - thin windows laptops with insane increases in battery life. No more jet engine sounds. 2.

Been good to me.I’m an HVAC technician on construction side, Qualcomm here in my city has been blowing up. TI-ing offices into more lab spaces with hundreds of shielding rooms for working on chips. The guys that work there couldn’t tell me what the chips do, but I can tell they’re going all in on it and it got me curious so I started watching the ticker.Apple, also has done the same thing. Hundreds of thousands of square feet of warehouses with hundreds of shielding rooms inside them dedicated to chips.This is no doubt the next Industrial boom. These companies are spending SO much money on the development of this shit.Also, fuck them for moving into town because housing market skyrocketed now that there are 26 year old techie millionaires coming in from Silicon Valley. 🖕🏼 I was closer to buying a house 3 years ago when I made half as much money 😂",0,0.527,0.845,POSITIVE
