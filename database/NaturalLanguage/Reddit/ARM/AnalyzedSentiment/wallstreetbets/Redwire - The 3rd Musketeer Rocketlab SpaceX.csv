Redwire does more than provide RF and Antennas for RKLB's SDA satellites, they are also base lined into York and other providers platforms.Rocket Structures. Something that alot of people dont know is that Redwire is also helping X-bow systems with the SRM production by supplying the company with structures for their bolt family of rockets.Moon & Mars. Redwire has lunar and martian optionality, they have multiple different lunar contract like MASON with NASA/tipping point which is for building landing pads and roads using regolith & VSAT which is a partnership with the company astrobotic where Redwire is providing ROSA arrays of various sizes to provide power for the lunar surface. For Mars Redwire has been awarded a study contract for Design Reference Mission (DRM) 3 of NASA’s Mars Commercial Services program, which outlines a commercial imagery mission to support lower-cost, higher-frequency missions to the Red PlanetThere is in fact even more I could talk about too but ill cut it here, thanks for the post and the visability into a great company.",0,0.54,POSITIVE,0.983

To sit are similar valuations based upon growth and income, Redwire would not to hit approximately $42/share. At this point it would still remain once of the cheapest yet most advanced space companies out there. Why now? Stocks move in themes, every success trader from here to Timbuktu will tell you that. It’s caused by the excitement and willingness of investors to take on risk on what they believe to be innovative and early stage Giants. The recent news of SpaceX, the parabolic run in ASTS and Rocketlabs 50th successful launch, all set the stage for a new theme and fomo rally to emerge. Just like when EVs moved thanks to the hype in Tesla we saw the entire sector move. Just like when $AI started the AI run and others such as NVDA (plus plenty of others) took the button and ran for 12-18 months. I see the Space sector as an emerging theme and names such as Redwire could potentially take the baton and garner worldwide interest. For me, I see the worst case, bear case, as Redwire being a $1bn+ market cap by Christmas, which still represents a 100% move. Best case I see buyers stepping into calls of which market makers are drastically under-positioned for, creating a substantial over the top rally. Please note: I haven’t a fucking clue what I’m talking about and none of this is advice. My calls for December posted below.",Earnings was a 💩,0,0.61,NEGATIVE,0.873
