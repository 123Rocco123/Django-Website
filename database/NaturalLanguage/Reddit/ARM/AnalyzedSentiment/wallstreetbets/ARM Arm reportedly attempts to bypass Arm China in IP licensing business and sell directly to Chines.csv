I'm open to debating","It was up 4% cause of TSM reporting good earnings. To mee seems surprising as usually TSM and ASML earnings were in sync, whenever asml did bad tsm did bad and when asml did good tsm did good, but most likely the market shrugged it off since its a European company and their saying its due to loss of Chinese customers.I think lam research might be the stimulus when it also has bad earnings like last august. It did -10% when asml did poorly, so more correlated.",2,0.554,1.0,NEGATIVE

Do you think that the companies are just going against the government. You are reading wayyyy too much into this. The shit paywall acts like there something juicy with a complete drop off of any real information. It's clickbait. What it is most likely is that they want to get their payments more on time and see the government in the way of that. ARM does have leverage here. I am pretty sure China doesn't want ANOTHER chip company saying no to China,6,0.538,1.0,NEGATIVE
