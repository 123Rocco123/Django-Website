,"The movement away from NVIDIA MICROSOFT GOOGLE APPLE and other giants will flood into other stocks in the short term we will see another chip rally in stocks with a lower market cap But the likes of Bill gates and Warren Buffet will buy back into these mega tech stocks which will regain its value over the years Warren has already sold some apple, he will sell some more but has a lot of money on hand saving for a recession but he will spend a lot on the above companies. The money flows back and forth stabilising at similar levels over the long term. These companies will after losing half their value rise again at the same time as other Chip companies catch up increasing market cap. Arm MU INTC AMD TSMC IBM The increased automation using AI and Robotics in industrial processes will see increased production and need for chips in products. Exponential growth of cloud storage will also drive it in the long term, newer chips use requirinf less energy bringing down costs of cloud storage fueling growth. There will always be a thirst for advanced chips in cloud storage and super computers. But consumer tech outside of AI and robotics?? how advanced do chips have to be in consumer tech after a certain level? Advancement in modern chips will increase for a short time in consumer tech improving energy efficiency and speed so a phone battery can last 4 times longer while phone working faster for example but beyond that consumer chips won't be innovative until we have home robots. Cloud storage robotics and locally stored AI requires innovative chips but once energy efficiency has peaked so will innovation in consumer chips over the near future. Even home computing with faster Internet speeds will move to the cloud and AI computing so as entertainment advances with AI it'll never require extremely advanced chips at home. I envision AI being able to create TV shows movies computer games for the user, based on their requirements and specifications and the plot of the story they want. Within a few decades possible. This is a crucial point where companies rise or turn into potatoes collapsing in value. But potatoes still sell chips. Are there any other chip companies that are relevant? I know the big tech are starting to make their own Chips for AI. There's going to be a bottle neck in demand driving up stock prices artificially propping up the price of chips and when increased automation and robotics are used in chip manufacturing too some companies stock prices will collapse as others that went through the transformation of automation in manufacturing will flourish. Intel is a company that is low in price but heavily investing and receiving government funds to expand their production as well as innovation in their automated production processes, is it intel who say they don't need Asml lithograph machines? Their stagnant value may radically turn around. It is intel pivoting the the mass production future for consumer tech and not the high end innovation others like NVIDIA or IBM seek. All of those will see exponential growth over the next 5 or so years and then the increased mass production may see some rise and others fall. All the while this is occurring money will be sucked out of other sectors lowering stock prices, another opportunity if chosen wisely as they'll have to go through the same transformation implementing AI and robotics and then they will see increased growth with money flowing back when their revenue increases.

Exponential growth of cloud storage will also drive it in the long term, newer chips use requirinf less energy bringing down costs of cloud storage fueling growth. There will always be a thirst for advanced chips in cloud storage and super computers. But consumer tech outside of AI and robotics?? how advanced do chips have to be in consumer tech after a certain level? Advancement in modern chips will increase for a short time in consumer tech improving energy efficiency and speed so a phone battery can last 4 times longer while phone working faster for example but beyond that consumer chips won't be innovative until we have home robots. Cloud storage robotics and locally stored AI requires innovative chips but once energy efficiency has peaked so will innovation in consumer chips over the near future. Even home computing with faster Internet speeds will move to the cloud and AI computing so as entertainment advances with AI it'll never require extremely advanced chips at home. I envision AI being able to create TV shows movies computer games for the user, based on their requirements and specifications and the plot of the story they want. Within a few decades possible. This is a crucial point where companies rise or turn into potatoes collapsing in value. But potatoes still sell chips. Are there any other chip companies that are relevant? I know the big tech are starting to make their own Chips for AI. There's going to be a bottle neck in demand driving up stock prices artificially propping up the price of chips and when increased automation and robotics are used in chip manufacturing too some companies stock prices will collapse as others that went through the transformation of automation in manufacturing will flourish. Intel is a company that is low in price but heavily investing and receiving government funds to expand their production as well as innovation in their automated production processes, is it intel who say they don't need Asml lithograph machines? Their stagnant value may radically turn around. It is intel pivoting the the mass production future for consumer tech and not the high end innovation others like NVIDIA or IBM seek. All of those will see exponential growth over the next 5 or so years and then the increased mass production may see some rise and others fall. All the while this is occurring money will be sucked out of other sectors lowering stock prices, another opportunity if chosen wisely as they'll have to go through the same transformation implementing AI and robotics and then they will see increased growth with money flowing back when their revenue increases.
