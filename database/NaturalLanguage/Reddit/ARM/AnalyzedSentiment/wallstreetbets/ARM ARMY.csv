Fast forward and Iâ€™ve been writing ccs on them all this time below my basis for bits and bobs. Now theyâ€™re on fire and up a respectable 25-40%.

Anyone else holding arm? What say you?","I was trading ARM back in the day when it was FTSE-listed. I worked in the industry, using their chip designs every day. I witnessed first-hand how hard they were sold into the huge pre-2008 Chinese dumb phone market. It was basically a money-printing machine, even before the iPhone first came along. I only wish I'd had enough cash back then to load up on it properly. When it re-listed on the NASDAQ, I got back in just as it cleared the $70 mark.ARM's USP is low-power fabless chip designs. Sure there is a lot more competition now in that space, but they have heading for 40 years experience of their market, and they work with so many different companies it's insane. Their silicon powers everything from embedded Cortex micros right up to Apple's Mx processors and beyond into cloud/AI.Crucially, I think they're so ubiquitous they often get overlooked. They got a lot of press back when Apple were cool, but since they sold to SoftBank I think they went slightly into obscurity mainly because the stock was no longer publicly traded. But they're still as big a force as ever. There was a statistic I saw that 70% of the world's population owns an ARM device. And they are consumable products, they upgrade them regularly.I'm staying HODL for the long term.",0,0.532,0.997,POSITIVE
