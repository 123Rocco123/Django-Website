,,"Nvidia just announced that they are basing the next wave of their AI foundry on Arm chips, each blackwell uses like 70 arm chips. Production is set to quadruple each year for the next decade and it still wont be enough. PE is only valuable for looking at mature companies, ARM is at the beginning of its journey. It’s the cornerstone piece in the AI universe and so in the next big boom of this coming decade. Every player relies on it to produce their chips and no one is gonna replace them faster than they can improve their offering.",1,0.55,0.849,POSITIVE

,,"That shit you're regurgitating. Forward PE is in the 90s, but guess what, so was TSLAs in 2020 before it exploded. You don't think the market knows the PE. These stocks grow into price... that's the point. Go short it then, since it's so overvalued.",1,0.527,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"I am shorting it. I’ve got 10k in May $100 puts. This company is going to 0 within 10 years. The ecosystem is being replaced by RISC-V. ARM’s own customers are all funding this.Not to mention SoftBank is levered as fuck, its own founder Masayoshi owes the firm more than 5 billion. Junk credit rating. No lender with a brain is giving these guys any money. The moment it dips, they’ll have to start selling.They can’t get rid of the shares through forward contracts either, unless a buyer is willing to take on the risk in terms of PE inflation.

,,"big balls. I’m also on the arm bear train. business fundementals are great imo, but this valuation is irrational and unsustainable. I want to ask you, when did you open this position and why did you put 100% of your portfolio? After it being flat on lockup expiration I have gotten somewhat hesitant to make bigger moves.",5,0.529,1.0,NEGATIVE
