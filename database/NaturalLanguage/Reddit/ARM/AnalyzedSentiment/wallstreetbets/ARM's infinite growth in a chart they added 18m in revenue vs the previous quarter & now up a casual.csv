,,Caring about valuation cost me an easy $1m in the last year. I was going to buy ARM this week but it's already selling at 20x forward revenue and gave it a pass. Now at like 27x forward rev. Unreal,1,0.565,1.0,NEGATIVE

,,This is dumb. You obviously didn't listen to the guidance. This is all about guidance. They sandbagged and you didn't pay attention. He said it on the previous earnings call.,0,0.572,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"They make $800m from 7 billlion devices. Even if it goes to 20 billion devices, they will barely reach $2bn, which it won't. They are expecting modest increase next quarter.",1,0.567,0.998,NEGATIVE
,,"Again, you didn't listen to the earnings call. Your mistake is that you think the revenue is somehow static based on some multiple.It is not.They have about 7000 patents on a technology that is going to require more advanced compute on edge devices. You can't run an RTX 5090 on your phone but you can run NPU's on your phone through ARM.They're ability to raise that licensing and royalty can be done at any time. They literally explained this in the call with V9.So that multiple becomes much larger over time. I hope this is understandable. Have you noticed that smartphones are getting more expensive? Arm can and will participate in that profit. This only has upside.There is caution. China and Risc-V but that's ok on 99.999% penetration.I'm not saying it's Apple or Nvidia or Microsoft at their infancy but it's a pretty good upside because of AI as of now. That's how I see it.",2,0.539,0.999,NEGATIVE

,,"On the one hand, this technology can't be so unique if there are 7000 patents. Can't the top engineers at Nvidia and AMD not come up with an alternative solution for any of the 7000 applications that the patent royalties cash in?On the other hand, there are 1200m smartphones sold each year, if ARM gets 10% royalty and each phone costs $1000, they get 120bn. Apply a nice 30PE and this should trade at $5000/share. 48x from the current price. I know I'm being conservative but the stock has momentum. Will probably overshoot to 10k",3,0.572,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"if you think that valuations are tied to earnings you're going to have to get into a time machine and go back to like 1988https://www.macrotrends.net/2577/sp-500-pe-ratio-price-to-earnings-chartso go be a value investor. buy companies with like less than the historical average p/e ratio. let us know how it works out. im not even being a dick, if thats how you feel then go for it. i just wonder if the market will agree.or if you think this one company is overblown buy some long term puts. seems shakier but its a play if this is how you feel about the gap between earnings and valuations.",0,0.558,1.0,NEGATIVE
