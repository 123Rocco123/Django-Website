If you extrapolate that to Blackwell, it has 576GB of ""Micron"" HBM3e in each GPU - and the whole GB200 NvLink server has a total of 30TB of HBM3 (GB200 has a staggering 1.4 exflops - which is 1.4 quintillions of floating-point operations per second - absolutely staggering, but I digress). Hynix do not yet have HBM3e capability but they are catching up but Micron is already testing HBM4 which is even more silicon intensive.What this means is: dies are being used up for HBM builds in large quantities, thereby throttling supplies to ""day job"" customers such as mobile phones, laptops, devices, autos, etc. This will create the price bump you are talking about in normal memory products for the foreseeable future, despite no increases to DRAM or NAND TAM.Last point is: end users are also acutely aware of the memory price cycles. Which is why when memory prices hit rock bottom at the beginning of 2023, your iPhone still cost the same, if not more. This is because end users of memory (companies like Apple or Dell) dont pass on savings from low prices to the customers as they know then when the market turns, they have to absorb the price increases.",3,0.523,0.874,POSITIVE

I introduce Micron Technology Inc. (Ticker $MU) With a current work force of 34,000, partnerships with multiple big name chip manufacturers, processor manufactures and Verification IP Partners, the future looks bright for Micron. Full partnership list here. The big boys in the short game have completely screwed themselves on this one. There are some major sized institutional longs (Blackrock and Vanguard up top as always) but shorts have tried to average up to the point where they're guaranteed to implode when Micron takes off again. Their current dark pool position looks like this: For a year, shorts have been forced to average up to a $7B position and haven't been able to balance out. Someone will get blown to hell on this one shortly. Yet another one of these price charts: With only one split (2:1 - 05/02/2000) in the history of this 46 year old company, it has a long way to go. - Blowing up that dark pool position will find a stupid high before things settle down around the $180-190 area. - Next earnings expected end of June. Position: Weekly Calls $140-150 until things settle down. Then I'll look at shares and sell calls. TADR: $MU going up.

,"Read slowly and I'll try not to use too many big words. Chips are a good play. Operating systems have been a good play. AI is a good play. Processing is cool. When you put all these things together, you get some serious computer power. From that comes data. A shit load of data. As much as AI is overblown, [and if people actually knew what it really was (think program ETF), they'ld calm the f*ck down a bit] it pulls in a lot of data, processes it and spits it back out in a new form. That new data needs to go somewhere. You need to have a massive storage bank to pull from, somewhere to shove the new found data and quickly. At the rate computational power is accelerating, data won't just be doubling, it will be far beyond that. Sure, clouds are great but they're also public and easily hackable today. Businesses that depends on secrecy so their ideas don't get stolen and ""crunched"" by a bigger outfit need somewhere to hold those bytes without spending an arm and a leg.
