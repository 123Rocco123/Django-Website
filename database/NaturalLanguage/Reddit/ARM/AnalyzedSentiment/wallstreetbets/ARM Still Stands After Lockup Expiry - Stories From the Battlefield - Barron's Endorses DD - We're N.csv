,"4 Scores and 3 months ago I came to with the world's GREATEST DD only to be left ridiculed and laughed at by the masses. I tried to share with you knowledge from the front about how things in the world that are changing and whom those players are who bringeth such change. A 0 is all this DD could muster. It's ok, fear not, for I forgiveth you all. I bring to you news again from the front-lines of the greatest battle ever to waged in the 21st century - The AI Chip Wars On March 12th the Arm Holdings Expiry was released and employees where free to sell their shares. There were many articles fanning fear that the ARM apocalypse would ensue during this tumultuous week. And the confabulation that Arm's parent company SoftBank would simply UNLOAD billions and billions of shares and simply dilute and pummel the Arm stock into submission.

But I held Diamond hands and decided that I would not hedge or buy puts or short positions for a temporary ""feared"" sell-off. I am here to tell you. ARM Held - NOT GIVING A DAMN INCH of pull back. SoftBank protected the ARM Holdings position and did NOT let the stock go below $125. Look at the tiny trade volume standing tall. That GREEN Wall of protection ensued a wonderful and grande blockaide against puts and short sellers and profit takers. In the words of Karp (PLTR) - I love watching short sellers crumble and things about their drug dealers (some shit like that.) Look at the volume a day / 2 days later. Nothing much. Their is not a major sell off AT ALL. ARM has passed the lock-up period test. Oh and before we go to the Barron's DD I wanted to share with you something spectacular. In this video. I want you to realize how profound of a time you are living in where we can do this technology. It is truly mind-blowing. And what you must understand is that ARM is and will be at the forefront of this. The way the robot see's the world, can think about the world and speak and interact with the world will all be done on ARM CPU's and GPU's. Behold Figure AI with OpenAI ChatGPT deep integration. 0:00 / 0:00 This is the future and AI chips will be in this robotic control plane. From Tesla's Optimus to Figure AI 01 to the multitude of lesser and perhaps cheaper versions will all be powered by efficient and accelerated compute localized to the corresponding robotic device. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-innovations-has-chip-giant-arm-brought-delivery-robot/ Most importantly, Arm's highly integrated and low-power characteristics make delivery robots more compact and durable while significantly reducing manufacturing costs. This substantially enhances their competitiveness in the market. In summary, Arm's chip applications in the field of delivery robot technology have changed the game, providing unprecedented value and experiences for robot manufacturers and end-users. With further technological advancements, we have reason to believe that Arm will continue to lead the revolution in this field, bringing more surprises and possibilities to the world. It is truly an amazing time we live in to see the ground floor of these start to take root. Finally, I bring you Barron's (paywall avoiding article) ARM CEO SEES A HUGE TAILWIND FROM NEW CHIPS - NVIDIA & INTEL ARE HELPING TOO written by Tae Kim. Arm’s latest advanced chip technology, called Armv9, generates double the royalty rates of its previous Armv8 products. For some high-end processors, which combine more than 100 “cores,” Arm’s designs are now pulling in more than $100 per chip. It’s a massive change from prior generations. Arm's high-end Chips are earning over $100 per chip. That is a MASSIVE change. Cloud server chips based on Arm technology also benefit from the rapid growth in AI with Nvidia using Arm for its GH200 AI Superchip data center systems. A GH200 Superchip can have up to 144 CPU cores and Arm gets paid for each one. The question for investors now is whether the company’s recent financial performance is sustainable. I, for one, am bullish. Arm’s customers have been willing to pay the higher royalty rates, meaning the boost from Armv9 is likely in the early stages. Further, Arm-based cloud server chips from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others will likely generate robust revenue for years. Outside of Nvidia, Arm may be the best fundamental growth story in technology. Here are edited highlights from my conversation with Haas: Barron’s: Can you talk about Arm’s opportunities in the cloud server data center market. It looks like this business is starting to take off. When we were privatized, we had an opportunity to look at what to do with our investment dollars. With data centers, we noticed several things that we could do. If you want to put together processors, we were lacking a fabric [to weave the network together]. We were lacking certain extension instructions. So we designed CPUs with the right power profile, features, and performance. Then there was a bunch of work that needed to happen in the software ecosystem. The magic moment came when Red Hat announced their Linux distribution for Arm servers. It all came together. Amazon saw it very early. Roughly half of Amazon’s AWS server additions are now Arm-based. We also changed our business model. In the past, it would have been crazy to think Arm would someday get paid $100 for each SoC [system- on-a-chip]. But that is what we are getting after we priced at 50 cents to $1 per core. If you put in 100 cores, we are getting north of $100 on these SoCs. What kind of demand are you seeing for the Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper AI systems? In the last earnings report, you noted how the GH200 will run some of the most demanding AI applications in the world today. It’s very, very strong. Nvidia is pushing it very hard. What Nvidia has done with Grace Hopper is essentially taken 72 to 144 Arm CPU cores, and bolted it to an H100. It replaces the x86 implementation. Nvidia has also done all the CUDA driver work for Arm-based CPUs. It’s great for us that Nvidia is shipping it. What’s the impact to the business going from Armv8 to Armv9? I saw that Armv9 accounted for 15% of royalty revenue in the December quarter from 10% the prior quarter. Is that pace going to keep up? It is. A couple of things to keep in mind on v8 to v9. We’re going to see very, very fast adoption with v9. Everything that we do in servers is v9. It’s more power efficient and has a huge amount of security features. Then in mobile, premium Android is mostly all v9. Over the next couple of years, most Android smartphones will move that way. I expect the other alternative operating system on phones to go that way as well. Then you get into the economics. When we went from v7 to v8, we doubled the royalty rates from about 1%-1.5% to 3%. On v8 to v9, we’ve doubled it again to 5% or close to 6%. It’s a huge tailwind for us in royalty growth. We locked down those v9 contracts in 2020-2021, knowing that starting in 2023, they would start to kick in. Our confidence rate on the sustainability of that is quite high. Intel, under CEO Pat Gelsinger, has prioritized Intel Foundry—to give the market an alternative to Taiwan Semiconductor. How did it feel to be on the stage at Intel’s recent Foundry event, and what do you see from that partnership going forward? I think Intel has realized that for Intel Foundry to be successful, they were going to have to look at where Taiwan Semiconductor was shipping a lot of volume. Intel Foundry executive Stu Pann said 80% of TSMC’s logic wafers have Arm in some shape or form. So partnering with Arm is table stakes for Intel to grow that business. Quite candidly, when I came on board, it was a little chilly between the two companies. I had a lot of meetings with Pat Gelsinger after I started. We came to a meeting of the minds that both companies would benefit, and more broadly, the ecosystem would benefit if we partnered closely. They’ve been great. They’re spending a lot of engineering effort to make sure that the world’s best server chip based on Arm can be built on Intel’s manufacturing process. On one level, that sounds kind of crazy, but they’re quite committed to it. We would love to see them be successful. So let's recap all that BULLISH goodness. Arm is making over $100 per SOC (System on Chip) Nvidia's most high end GPU's are going to be using 144 core ARM chips and ARM is getting paid per Core x86-x64 is getting replaced writ large ARM V9 version 3 is just getting started with it's higher royalty rates going from 10% of total revenue to 15% in the previously reported quarter AWS and increasingly Azure are using ARM based servers in their data cloud offerings. More power per watt, cheaper and more efficient Android is mostly all V9 Intel is getting friendly with ARM to fab it's chip production to compete with TSM and help out Intell in its continued success.

With data centers, we noticed several things that we could do. If you want to put together processors, we were lacking a fabric [to weave the network together]. We were lacking certain extension instructions. So we designed CPUs with the right power profile, features, and performance. Then there was a bunch of work that needed to happen in the software ecosystem. The magic moment came when Red Hat announced their Linux distribution for Arm servers. It all came together. Amazon saw it very early. Roughly half of Amazon’s AWS server additions are now Arm-based. We also changed our business model. In the past, it would have been crazy to think Arm would someday get paid $100 for each SoC [system- on-a-chip]. But that is what we are getting after we priced at 50 cents to $1 per core. If you put in 100 cores, we are getting north of $100 on these SoCs. What kind of demand are you seeing for the Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper AI systems? In the last earnings report, you noted how the GH200 will run some of the most demanding AI applications in the world today. It’s very, very strong. Nvidia is pushing it very hard. What Nvidia has done with Grace Hopper is essentially taken 72 to 144 Arm CPU cores, and bolted it to an H100. It replaces the x86 implementation. Nvidia has also done all the CUDA driver work for Arm-based CPUs. It’s great for us that Nvidia is shipping it. What’s the impact to the business going from Armv8 to Armv9? I saw that Armv9 accounted for 15% of royalty revenue in the December quarter from 10% the prior quarter. Is that pace going to keep up? It is. A couple of things to keep in mind on v8 to v9. We’re going to see very, very fast adoption with v9. Everything that we do in servers is v9. It’s more power efficient and has a huge amount of security features. Then in mobile, premium Android is mostly all v9. Over the next couple of years, most Android smartphones will move that way. I expect the other alternative operating system on phones to go that way as well. Then you get into the economics. When we went from v7 to v8, we doubled the royalty rates from about 1%-1.5% to 3%. On v8 to v9, we’ve doubled it again to 5% or close to 6%. It’s a huge tailwind for us in royalty growth. We locked down those v9 contracts in 2020-2021, knowing that starting in 2023, they would start to kick in. Our confidence rate on the sustainability of that is quite high. Intel, under CEO Pat Gelsinger, has prioritized Intel Foundry—to give the market an alternative to Taiwan Semiconductor. How did it feel to be on the stage at Intel’s recent Foundry event, and what do you see from that partnership going forward? I think Intel has realized that for Intel Foundry to be successful, they were going to have to look at where Taiwan Semiconductor was shipping a lot of volume. Intel Foundry executive Stu Pann said 80% of TSMC’s logic wafers have Arm in some shape or form. So partnering with Arm is table stakes for Intel to grow that business. Quite candidly, when I came on board, it was a little chilly between the two companies. I had a lot of meetings with Pat Gelsinger after I started. We came to a meeting of the minds that both companies would benefit, and more broadly, the ecosystem would benefit if we partnered closely. They’ve been great. They’re spending a lot of engineering effort to make sure that the world’s best server chip based on Arm can be built on Intel’s manufacturing process. On one level, that sounds kind of crazy, but they’re quite committed to it. We would love to see them be successful. So let's recap all that BULLISH goodness. Arm is making over $100 per SOC (System on Chip) Nvidia's most high end GPU's are going to be using 144 core ARM chips and ARM is getting paid per Core x86-x64 is getting replaced writ large ARM V9 version 3 is just getting started with it's higher royalty rates going from 10% of total revenue to 15% in the previously reported quarter AWS and increasingly Azure are using ARM based servers in their data cloud offerings. More power per watt, cheaper and more efficient Android is mostly all V9 Intel is getting friendly with ARM to fab it's chip production to compete with TSM and help out Intell in its continued success.

In summary, Arm's chip applications in the field of delivery robot technology have changed the game, providing unprecedented value and experiences for robot manufacturers and end-users. With further technological advancements, we have reason to believe that Arm will continue to lead the revolution in this field, bringing more surprises and possibilities to the world. It is truly an amazing time we live in to see the ground floor of these start to take root. Finally, I bring you Barron's (paywall avoiding article) ARM CEO SEES A HUGE TAILWIND FROM NEW CHIPS - NVIDIA & INTEL ARE HELPING TOO written by Tae Kim. Arm’s latest advanced chip technology, called Armv9, generates double the royalty rates of its previous Armv8 products. For some high-end processors, which combine more than 100 “cores,” Arm’s designs are now pulling in more than $100 per chip. It’s a massive change from prior generations. Arm's high-end Chips are earning over $100 per chip. That is a MASSIVE change. Cloud server chips based on Arm technology also benefit from the rapid growth in AI with Nvidia using Arm for its GH200 AI Superchip data center systems. A GH200 Superchip can have up to 144 CPU cores and Arm gets paid for each one. The question for investors now is whether the company’s recent financial performance is sustainable. I, for one, am bullish. Arm’s customers have been willing to pay the higher royalty rates, meaning the boost from Armv9 is likely in the early stages. Further, Arm-based cloud server chips from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others will likely generate robust revenue for years. Outside of Nvidia, Arm may be the best fundamental growth story in technology. Here are edited highlights from my conversation with Haas: Barron’s: Can you talk about Arm’s opportunities in the cloud server data center market.

It is truly an amazing time we live in to see the ground floor of these start to take root. Finally, I bring you Barron's (paywall avoiding article) ARM CEO SEES A HUGE TAILWIND FROM NEW CHIPS - NVIDIA & INTEL ARE HELPING TOO written by Tae Kim. Arm’s latest advanced chip technology, called Armv9, generates double the royalty rates of its previous Armv8 products. For some high-end processors, which combine more than 100 “cores,” Arm’s designs are now pulling in more than $100 per chip. It’s a massive change from prior generations. Arm's high-end Chips are earning over $100 per chip. That is a MASSIVE change. Cloud server chips based on Arm technology also benefit from the rapid growth in AI with Nvidia using Arm for its GH200 AI Superchip data center systems. A GH200 Superchip can have up to 144 CPU cores and Arm gets paid for each one. The question for investors now is whether the company’s recent financial performance is sustainable. I, for one, am bullish. Arm’s customers have been willing to pay the higher royalty rates, meaning the boost from Armv9 is likely in the early stages. Further, Arm-based cloud server chips from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others will likely generate robust revenue for years. Outside of Nvidia, Arm may be the best fundamental growth story in technology. Here are edited highlights from my conversation with Haas: Barron’s: Can you talk about Arm’s opportunities in the cloud server data center market. It looks like this business is starting to take off. When we were privatized, we had an opportunity to look at what to do with our investment dollars. With data centers, we noticed several things that we could do. If you want to put together processors, we were lacking a fabric [to weave the network together]. We were lacking certain extension instructions. So we designed CPUs with the right power profile, features, and performance. Then there was a bunch of work that needed to happen in the software ecosystem. The magic moment came when Red Hat announced their Linux distribution for Arm servers. It all came together. Amazon saw it very early. Roughly half of Amazon’s AWS server additions are now Arm-based. We also changed our business model. In the past, it would have been crazy to think Arm would someday get paid $100 for each SoC [system- on-a-chip]. But that is what we are getting after we priced at 50 cents to $1 per core. If you put in 100 cores, we are getting north of $100 on these SoCs. What kind of demand are you seeing for the Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper AI systems? In the last earnings report, you noted how the GH200 will run some of the most demanding AI applications in the world today. It’s very, very strong. Nvidia is pushing it very hard. What Nvidia has done with Grace Hopper is essentially taken 72 to 144 Arm CPU cores, and bolted it to an H100. It replaces the x86 implementation. Nvidia has also done all the CUDA driver work for Arm-based CPUs. It’s great for us that Nvidia is shipping it. What’s the impact to the business going from Armv8 to Armv9? I saw that Armv9 accounted for 15% of royalty revenue in the December quarter from 10% the prior quarter. Is that pace going to keep up? It is. A couple of things to keep in mind on v8 to v9. We’re going to see very, very fast adoption with v9. Everything that we do in servers is v9. It’s more power efficient and has a huge amount of security features. Then in mobile, premium Android is mostly all v9. Over the next couple of years, most Android smartphones will move that way. I expect the other alternative operating system on phones to go that way as well. Then you get into the economics. When we went from v7 to v8, we doubled the royalty rates from about 1%-1.5% to 3%. On v8 to v9, we’ve doubled it again to 5% or close to 6%. It’s a huge tailwind for us in royalty growth. We locked down those v9 contracts in 2020-2021, knowing that starting in 2023, they would start to kick in. Our confidence rate on the sustainability of that is quite high. Intel, under CEO Pat Gelsinger, has prioritized Intel Foundry—to give the market an alternative to Taiwan Semiconductor. How did it feel to be on the stage at Intel’s recent Foundry event, and what do you see from that partnership going forward? I think Intel has realized that for Intel Foundry to be successful, they were going to have to look at where Taiwan Semiconductor was shipping a lot of volume. Intel Foundry executive Stu Pann said 80% of TSMC’s logic wafers have Arm in some shape or form. So partnering with Arm is table stakes for Intel to grow that business. Quite candidly, when I came on board, it was a little chilly between the two companies. I had a lot of meetings with Pat Gelsinger after I started. We came to a meeting of the minds that both companies would benefit, and more broadly, the ecosystem would benefit if we partnered closely. They’ve been great. They’re spending a lot of engineering effort to make sure that the world’s best server chip based on Arm can be built on Intel’s manufacturing process. On one level, that sounds kind of crazy, but they’re quite committed to it. We would love to see them be successful. So let's recap all that BULLISH goodness. Arm is making over $100 per SOC (System on Chip) Nvidia's most high end GPU's are going to be using 144 core ARM chips and ARM is getting paid per Core x86-x64 is getting replaced writ large ARM V9 version 3 is just getting started with it's higher royalty rates going from 10% of total revenue to 15% in the previously reported quarter AWS and increasingly Azure are using ARM based servers in their data cloud offerings.

Further, Arm-based cloud server chips from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others will likely generate robust revenue for years. Outside of Nvidia, Arm may be the best fundamental growth story in technology. Here are edited highlights from my conversation with Haas: Barron’s: Can you talk about Arm’s opportunities in the cloud server data center market. It looks like this business is starting to take off. When we were privatized, we had an opportunity to look at what to do with our investment dollars. With data centers, we noticed several things that we could do. If you want to put together processors, we were lacking a fabric [to weave the network together]. We were lacking certain extension instructions. So we designed CPUs with the right power profile, features, and performance. Then there was a bunch of work that needed to happen in the software ecosystem. The magic moment came when Red Hat announced their Linux distribution for Arm servers. It all came together. Amazon saw it very early. Roughly half of Amazon’s AWS server additions are now Arm-based. We also changed our business model. In the past, it would have been crazy to think Arm would someday get paid $100 for each SoC [system- on-a-chip]. But that is what we are getting after we priced at 50 cents to $1 per core. If you put in 100 cores, we are getting north of $100 on these SoCs. What kind of demand are you seeing for the Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper AI systems? In the last earnings report, you noted how the GH200 will run some of the most demanding AI applications in the world today. It’s very, very strong. Nvidia is pushing it very hard. What Nvidia has done with Grace Hopper is essentially taken 72 to 144 Arm CPU cores, and bolted it to an H100. It replaces the x86 implementation. Nvidia has also done all the CUDA driver work for Arm-based CPUs. It’s great for us that Nvidia is shipping it. What’s the impact to the business going from Armv8 to Armv9? I saw that Armv9 accounted for 15% of royalty revenue in the December quarter from 10% the prior quarter. Is that pace going to keep up? It is. A couple of things to keep in mind on v8 to v9. We’re going to see very, very fast adoption with v9. Everything that we do in servers is v9. It’s more power efficient and has a huge amount of security features. Then in mobile, premium Android is mostly all v9. Over the next couple of years, most Android smartphones will move that way. I expect the other alternative operating system on phones to go that way as well. Then you get into the economics. When we went from v7 to v8, we doubled the royalty rates from about 1%-1.5% to 3%. On v8 to v9, we’ve doubled it again to 5% or close to 6%. It’s a huge tailwind for us in royalty growth. We locked down those v9 contracts in 2020-2021, knowing that starting in 2023, they would start to kick in. Our confidence rate on the sustainability of that is quite high. Intel, under CEO Pat Gelsinger, has prioritized Intel Foundry—to give the market an alternative to Taiwan Semiconductor. How did it feel to be on the stage at Intel’s recent Foundry event, and what do you see from that partnership going forward? I think Intel has realized that for Intel Foundry to be successful, they were going to have to look at where Taiwan Semiconductor was shipping a lot of volume. Intel Foundry executive Stu Pann said 80% of TSMC’s logic wafers have Arm in some shape or form. So partnering with Arm is table stakes for Intel to grow that business. Quite candidly, when I came on board, it was a little chilly between the two companies. I had a lot of meetings with Pat Gelsinger after I started. We came to a meeting of the minds that both companies would benefit, and more broadly, the ecosystem would benefit if we partnered closely. They’ve been great. They’re spending a lot of engineering effort to make sure that the world’s best server chip based on Arm can be built on Intel’s manufacturing process. On one level, that sounds kind of crazy, but they’re quite committed to it. We would love to see them be successful. So let's recap all that BULLISH goodness. Arm is making over $100 per SOC (System on Chip) Nvidia's most high end GPU's are going to be using 144 core ARM chips and ARM is getting paid per Core x86-x64 is getting replaced writ large ARM V9 version 3 is just getting started with it's higher royalty rates going from 10% of total revenue to 15% in the previously reported quarter AWS and increasingly Azure are using ARM based servers in their data cloud offerings. More power per watt, cheaper and more efficient Android is mostly all V9 Intel is getting friendly with ARM to fab it's chip production to compete with TSM and help out Intell in its continued success.

In summary, Arm's chip applications in the field of delivery robot technology have changed the game, providing unprecedented value and experiences for robot manufacturers and end-users. With further technological advancements, we have reason to believe that Arm will continue to lead the revolution in this field, bringing more surprises and possibilities to the world. It is truly an amazing time we live in to see the ground floor of these start to take root. Finally, I bring you Barron's (paywall avoiding article) ARM CEO SEES A HUGE TAILWIND FROM NEW CHIPS - NVIDIA & INTEL ARE HELPING TOO written by Tae Kim. Arm’s latest advanced chip technology, called Armv9, generates double the royalty rates of its previous Armv8 products. For some high-end processors, which combine more than 100 “cores,” Arm’s designs are now pulling in more than $100 per chip. It’s a massive change from prior generations. Arm's high-end Chips are earning over $100 per chip. That is a MASSIVE change.

It is truly an amazing time we live in to see the ground floor of these start to take root. Finally, I bring you Barron's (paywall avoiding article) ARM CEO SEES A HUGE TAILWIND FROM NEW CHIPS - NVIDIA & INTEL ARE HELPING TOO written by Tae Kim. Arm’s latest advanced chip technology, called Armv9, generates double the royalty rates of its previous Armv8 products. For some high-end processors, which combine more than 100 “cores,” Arm’s designs are now pulling in more than $100 per chip. It’s a massive change from prior generations. Arm's high-end Chips are earning over $100 per chip. That is a MASSIVE change. Cloud server chips based on Arm technology also benefit from the rapid growth in AI with Nvidia using Arm for its GH200 AI Superchip data center systems. A GH200 Superchip can have up to 144 CPU cores and Arm gets paid for each one. The question for investors now is whether the company’s recent financial performance is sustainable. I, for one, am bullish. Arm’s customers have been willing to pay the higher royalty rates, meaning the boost from Armv9 is likely in the early stages. Further, Arm-based cloud server chips from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others will likely generate robust revenue for years. Outside of Nvidia, Arm may be the best fundamental growth story in technology. Here are edited highlights from my conversation with Haas: Barron’s: Can you talk about Arm’s opportunities in the cloud server data center market. It looks like this business is starting to take off. When we were privatized, we had an opportunity to look at what to do with our investment dollars. With data centers, we noticed several things that we could do. If you want to put together processors, we were lacking a fabric [to weave the network together]. We were lacking certain extension instructions. So we designed CPUs with the right power profile, features, and performance. Then there was a bunch of work that needed to happen in the software ecosystem. The magic moment came when Red Hat announced their Linux distribution for Arm servers. It all came together. Amazon saw it very early. Roughly half of Amazon’s AWS server additions are now Arm-based. We also changed our business model. In the past, it would have been crazy to think Arm would someday get paid $100 for each SoC [system- on-a-chip]. But that is what we are getting after we priced at 50 cents to $1 per core. If you put in 100 cores, we are getting north of $100 on these SoCs. What kind of demand are you seeing for the Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper AI systems? In the last earnings report, you noted how the GH200 will run some of the most demanding AI applications in the world today. It’s very, very strong. Nvidia is pushing it very hard. What Nvidia has done with Grace Hopper is essentially taken 72 to 144 Arm CPU cores, and bolted it to an H100. It replaces the x86 implementation. Nvidia has also done all the CUDA driver work for Arm-based CPUs. It’s great for us that Nvidia is shipping it. What’s the impact to the business going from Armv8 to Armv9? I saw that Armv9 accounted for 15% of royalty revenue in the December quarter from 10% the prior quarter. Is that pace going to keep up? It is. A couple of things to keep in mind on v8 to v9. We’re going to see very, very fast adoption with v9. Everything that we do in servers is v9. It’s more power efficient and has a huge amount of security features. Then in mobile, premium Android is mostly all v9. Over the next couple of years, most Android smartphones will move that way. I expect the other alternative operating system on phones to go that way as well. Then you get into the economics. When we went from v7 to v8, we doubled the royalty rates from about 1%-1.5% to 3%. On v8 to v9, we’ve doubled it again to 5% or close to 6%. It’s a huge tailwind for us in royalty growth. We locked down those v9 contracts in 2020-2021, knowing that starting in 2023, they would start to kick in. Our confidence rate on the sustainability of that is quite high. Intel, under CEO Pat Gelsinger, has prioritized Intel Foundry—to give the market an alternative to Taiwan Semiconductor. How did it feel to be on the stage at Intel’s recent Foundry event, and what do you see from that partnership going forward? I think Intel has realized that for Intel Foundry to be successful, they were going to have to look at where Taiwan Semiconductor was shipping a lot of volume. Intel Foundry executive Stu Pann said 80% of TSMC’s logic wafers have Arm in some shape or form. So partnering with Arm is table stakes for Intel to grow that business. Quite candidly, when I came on board, it was a little chilly between the two companies. I had a lot of meetings with Pat Gelsinger after I started. We came to a meeting of the minds that both companies would benefit, and more broadly, the ecosystem would benefit if we partnered closely. They’ve been great. They’re spending a lot of engineering effort to make sure that the world’s best server chip based on Arm can be built on Intel’s manufacturing process. On one level, that sounds kind of crazy, but they’re quite committed to it. We would love to see them be successful. So let's recap all that BULLISH goodness.

For some high-end processors, which combine more than 100 “cores,” Arm’s designs are now pulling in more than $100 per chip. It’s a massive change from prior generations. Arm's high-end Chips are earning over $100 per chip. That is a MASSIVE change. Cloud server chips based on Arm technology also benefit from the rapid growth in AI with Nvidia using Arm for its GH200 AI Superchip data center systems. A GH200 Superchip can have up to 144 CPU cores and Arm gets paid for each one. The question for investors now is whether the company’s recent financial performance is sustainable. I, for one, am bullish. Arm’s customers have been willing to pay the higher royalty rates, meaning the boost from Armv9 is likely in the early stages. Further, Arm-based cloud server chips from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others will likely generate robust revenue for years. Outside of Nvidia, Arm may be the best fundamental growth story in technology. Here are edited highlights from my conversation with Haas: Barron’s: Can you talk about Arm’s opportunities in the cloud server data center market. It looks like this business is starting to take off. When we were privatized, we had an opportunity to look at what to do with our investment dollars. With data centers, we noticed several things that we could do. If you want to put together processors, we were lacking a fabric [to weave the network together]. We were lacking certain extension instructions. So we designed CPUs with the right power profile, features, and performance. Then there was a bunch of work that needed to happen in the software ecosystem. The magic moment came when Red Hat announced their Linux distribution for Arm servers. It all came together. Amazon saw it very early. Roughly half of Amazon’s AWS server additions are now Arm-based. We also changed our business model. In the past, it would have been crazy to think Arm would someday get paid $100 for each SoC [system- on-a-chip]. But that is what we are getting after we priced at 50 cents to $1 per core. If you put in 100 cores, we are getting north of $100 on these SoCs. What kind of demand are you seeing for the Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper AI systems? In the last earnings report, you noted how the GH200 will run some of the most demanding AI applications in the world today. It’s very, very strong. Nvidia is pushing it very hard. What Nvidia has done with Grace Hopper is essentially taken 72 to 144 Arm CPU cores, and bolted it to an H100. It replaces the x86 implementation. Nvidia has also done all the CUDA driver work for Arm-based CPUs. It’s great for us that Nvidia is shipping it. What’s the impact to the business going from Armv8 to Armv9? I saw that Armv9 accounted for 15% of royalty revenue in the December quarter from 10% the prior quarter. Is that pace going to keep up? It is. A couple of things to keep in mind on v8 to v9. We’re going to see very, very fast adoption with v9. Everything that we do in servers is v9. It’s more power efficient and has a huge amount of security features. Then in mobile, premium Android is mostly all v9. Over the next couple of years, most Android smartphones will move that way. I expect the other alternative operating system on phones to go that way as well. Then you get into the economics. When we went from v7 to v8, we doubled the royalty rates from about 1%-1.5% to 3%. On v8 to v9, we’ve doubled it again to 5% or close to 6%. It’s a huge tailwind for us in royalty growth. We locked down those v9 contracts in 2020-2021, knowing that starting in 2023, they would start to kick in. Our confidence rate on the sustainability of that is quite high. Intel, under CEO Pat Gelsinger, has prioritized Intel Foundry—to give the market an alternative to Taiwan Semiconductor. How did it feel to be on the stage at Intel’s recent Foundry event, and what do you see from that partnership going forward? I think Intel has realized that for Intel Foundry to be successful, they were going to have to look at where Taiwan Semiconductor was shipping a lot of volume. Intel Foundry executive Stu Pann said 80% of TSMC’s logic wafers have Arm in some shape or form. So partnering with Arm is table stakes for Intel to grow that business. Quite candidly, when I came on board, it was a little chilly between the two companies. I had a lot of meetings with Pat Gelsinger after I started. We came to a meeting of the minds that both companies would benefit, and more broadly, the ecosystem would benefit if we partnered closely. They’ve been great. They’re spending a lot of engineering effort to make sure that the world’s best server chip based on Arm can be built on Intel’s manufacturing process. On one level, that sounds kind of crazy, but they’re quite committed to it. We would love to see them be successful. So let's recap all that BULLISH goodness. Arm is making over $100 per SOC (System on Chip) Nvidia's most high end GPU's are going to be using 144 core ARM chips and ARM is getting paid per Core x86-x64 is getting replaced writ large ARM V9 version 3 is just getting started with it's higher royalty rates going from 10% of total revenue to 15% in the previously reported quarter AWS and increasingly Azure are using ARM based servers in their data cloud offerings. More power per watt, cheaper and more efficient Android is mostly all V9 Intel is getting friendly with ARM to fab it's chip production to compete with TSM and help out Intell in its continued success.

This substantially enhances their competitiveness in the market. In summary, Arm's chip applications in the field of delivery robot technology have changed the game, providing unprecedented value and experiences for robot manufacturers and end-users.

They’re spending a lot of engineering effort to make sure that the world’s best server chip based on Arm can be built on Intel’s manufacturing process. On one level, that sounds kind of crazy, but they’re quite committed to it. We would love to see them be successful. So let's recap all that BULLISH goodness.

In summary, Arm's chip applications in the field of delivery robot technology have changed the game, providing unprecedented value and experiences for robot manufacturers and end-users. With further technological advancements, we have reason to believe that Arm will continue to lead the revolution in this field, bringing more surprises and possibilities to the world. It is truly an amazing time we live in to see the ground floor of these start to take root. Finally, I bring you Barron's (paywall avoiding article) ARM CEO SEES A HUGE TAILWIND FROM NEW CHIPS - NVIDIA & INTEL ARE HELPING TOO written by Tae Kim. Arm’s latest advanced chip technology, called Armv9, generates double the royalty rates of its previous Armv8 products. For some high-end processors, which combine more than 100 “cores,” Arm’s designs are now pulling in more than $100 per chip. It’s a massive change from prior generations. Arm's high-end Chips are earning over $100 per chip. That is a MASSIVE change. Cloud server chips based on Arm technology also benefit from the rapid growth in AI with Nvidia using Arm for its GH200 AI Superchip data center systems. A GH200 Superchip can have up to 144 CPU cores and Arm gets paid for each one. The question for investors now is whether the company’s recent financial performance is sustainable. I, for one, am bullish. Arm’s customers have been willing to pay the higher royalty rates, meaning the boost from Armv9 is likely in the early stages. Further, Arm-based cloud server chips from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others will likely generate robust revenue for years. Outside of Nvidia, Arm may be the best fundamental growth story in technology. Here are edited highlights from my conversation with Haas: Barron’s: Can you talk about Arm’s opportunities in the cloud server data center market. It looks like this business is starting to take off. When we were privatized, we had an opportunity to look at what to do with our investment dollars. With data centers, we noticed several things that we could do. If you want to put together processors, we were lacking a fabric [to weave the network together]. We were lacking certain extension instructions. So we designed CPUs with the right power profile, features, and performance. Then there was a bunch of work that needed to happen in the software ecosystem. The magic moment came when Red Hat announced their Linux distribution for Arm servers. It all came together. Amazon saw it very early. Roughly half of Amazon’s AWS server additions are now Arm-based. We also changed our business model. In the past, it would have been crazy to think Arm would someday get paid $100 for each SoC [system- on-a-chip]. But that is what we are getting after we priced at 50 cents to $1 per core. If you put in 100 cores, we are getting north of $100 on these SoCs. What kind of demand are you seeing for the Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper AI systems? In the last earnings report, you noted how the GH200 will run some of the most demanding AI applications in the world today. It’s very, very strong. Nvidia is pushing it very hard. What Nvidia has done with Grace Hopper is essentially taken 72 to 144 Arm CPU cores, and bolted it to an H100. It replaces the x86 implementation. Nvidia has also done all the CUDA driver work for Arm-based CPUs. It’s great for us that Nvidia is shipping it. What’s the impact to the business going from Armv8 to Armv9? I saw that Armv9 accounted for 15% of royalty revenue in the December quarter from 10% the prior quarter. Is that pace going to keep up? It is. A couple of things to keep in mind on v8 to v9. We’re going to see very, very fast adoption with v9. Everything that we do in servers is v9. It’s more power efficient and has a huge amount of security features. Then in mobile, premium Android is mostly all v9. Over the next couple of years, most Android smartphones will move that way. I expect the other alternative operating system on phones to go that way as well. Then you get into the economics. When we went from v7 to v8, we doubled the royalty rates from about 1%-1.5% to 3%. On v8 to v9, we’ve doubled it again to 5% or close to 6%. It’s a huge tailwind for us in royalty growth. We locked down those v9 contracts in 2020-2021, knowing that starting in 2023, they would start to kick in. Our confidence rate on the sustainability of that is quite high. Intel, under CEO Pat Gelsinger, has prioritized Intel Foundry—to give the market an alternative to Taiwan Semiconductor. How did it feel to be on the stage at Intel’s recent Foundry event, and what do you see from that partnership going forward? I think Intel has realized that for Intel Foundry to be successful, they were going to have to look at where Taiwan Semiconductor was shipping a lot of volume. Intel Foundry executive Stu Pann said 80% of TSMC’s logic wafers have Arm in some shape or form. So partnering with Arm is table stakes for Intel to grow that business. Quite candidly, when I came on board, it was a little chilly between the two companies. I had a lot of meetings with Pat Gelsinger after I started.

It is truly an amazing time we live in to see the ground floor of these start to take root. Finally, I bring you Barron's (paywall avoiding article) ARM CEO SEES A HUGE TAILWIND FROM NEW CHIPS - NVIDIA & INTEL ARE HELPING TOO written by Tae Kim. Arm’s latest advanced chip technology, called Armv9, generates double the royalty rates of its previous Armv8 products. For some high-end processors, which combine more than 100 “cores,” Arm’s designs are now pulling in more than $100 per chip. It’s a massive change from prior generations. Arm's high-end Chips are earning over $100 per chip. That is a MASSIVE change. Cloud server chips based on Arm technology also benefit from the rapid growth in AI with Nvidia using Arm for its GH200 AI Superchip data center systems. A GH200 Superchip can have up to 144 CPU cores and Arm gets paid for each one. The question for investors now is whether the company’s recent financial performance is sustainable. I, for one, am bullish. Arm’s customers have been willing to pay the higher royalty rates, meaning the boost from Armv9 is likely in the early stages. Further, Arm-based cloud server chips from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others will likely generate robust revenue for years. Outside of Nvidia, Arm may be the best fundamental growth story in technology. Here are edited highlights from my conversation with Haas: Barron’s: Can you talk about Arm’s opportunities in the cloud server data center market. It looks like this business is starting to take off. When we were privatized, we had an opportunity to look at what to do with our investment dollars. With data centers, we noticed several things that we could do. If you want to put together processors, we were lacking a fabric [to weave the network together]. We were lacking certain extension instructions. So we designed CPUs with the right power profile, features, and performance. Then there was a bunch of work that needed to happen in the software ecosystem. The magic moment came when Red Hat announced their Linux distribution for Arm servers. It all came together. Amazon saw it very early. Roughly half of Amazon’s AWS server additions are now Arm-based. We also changed our business model. In the past, it would have been crazy to think Arm would someday get paid $100 for each SoC [system- on-a-chip]. But that is what we are getting after we priced at 50 cents to $1 per core. If you put in 100 cores, we are getting north of $100 on these SoCs. What kind of demand are you seeing for the Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper AI systems? In the last earnings report, you noted how the GH200 will run some of the most demanding AI applications in the world today. It’s very, very strong. Nvidia is pushing it very hard. What Nvidia has done with Grace Hopper is essentially taken 72 to 144 Arm CPU cores, and bolted it to an H100. It replaces the x86 implementation. Nvidia has also done all the CUDA driver work for Arm-based CPUs. It’s great for us that Nvidia is shipping it. What’s the impact to the business going from Armv8 to Armv9? I saw that Armv9 accounted for 15% of royalty revenue in the December quarter from 10% the prior quarter. Is that pace going to keep up? It is. A couple of things to keep in mind on v8 to v9. We’re going to see very, very fast adoption with v9. Everything that we do in servers is v9. It’s more power efficient and has a huge amount of security features. Then in mobile, premium Android is mostly all v9. Over the next couple of years, most Android smartphones will move that way. I expect the other alternative operating system on phones to go that way as well. Then you get into the economics. When we went from v7 to v8, we doubled the royalty rates from about 1%-1.5% to 3%. On v8 to v9, we’ve doubled it again to 5% or close to 6%. It’s a huge tailwind for us in royalty growth. We locked down those v9 contracts in 2020-2021, knowing that starting in 2023, they would start to kick in. Our confidence rate on the sustainability of that is quite high. Intel, under CEO Pat Gelsinger, has prioritized Intel Foundry—to give the market an alternative to Taiwan Semiconductor. How did it feel to be on the stage at Intel’s recent Foundry event, and what do you see from that partnership going forward? I think Intel has realized that for Intel Foundry to be successful, they were going to have to look at where Taiwan Semiconductor was shipping a lot of volume. Intel Foundry executive Stu Pann said 80% of TSMC’s logic wafers have Arm in some shape or form. So partnering with Arm is table stakes for Intel to grow that business. Quite candidly, when I came on board, it was a little chilly between the two companies. I had a lot of meetings with Pat Gelsinger after I started. We came to a meeting of the minds that both companies would benefit, and more broadly, the ecosystem would benefit if we partnered closely. They’ve been great. They’re spending a lot of engineering effort to make sure that the world’s best server chip based on Arm can be built on Intel’s manufacturing process. On one level, that sounds kind of crazy, but they’re quite committed to it. We would love to see them be successful. So let's recap all that BULLISH goodness. Arm is making over $100 per SOC (System on Chip) Nvidia's most high end GPU's are going to be using 144 core ARM chips and ARM is getting paid per Core x86-x64 is getting replaced writ large ARM V9 version 3 is just getting started with it's higher royalty rates going from 10% of total revenue to 15% in the previously reported quarter AWS and increasingly Azure are using ARM based servers in their data cloud offerings.

A GH200 Superchip can have up to 144 CPU cores and Arm gets paid for each one. The question for investors now is whether the company’s recent financial performance is sustainable. I, for one, am bullish. Arm’s customers have been willing to pay the higher royalty rates, meaning the boost from Armv9 is likely in the early stages. Further, Arm-based cloud server chips from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others will likely generate robust revenue for years. Outside of Nvidia, Arm may be the best fundamental growth story in technology. Here are edited highlights from my conversation with Haas: Barron’s: Can you talk about Arm’s opportunities in the cloud server data center market. It looks like this business is starting to take off. When we were privatized, we had an opportunity to look at what to do with our investment dollars. With data centers, we noticed several things that we could do. If you want to put together processors, we were lacking a fabric [to weave the network together]. We were lacking certain extension instructions. So we designed CPUs with the right power profile, features, and performance. Then there was a bunch of work that needed to happen in the software ecosystem. The magic moment came when Red Hat announced their Linux distribution for Arm servers. It all came together. Amazon saw it very early. Roughly half of Amazon’s AWS server additions are now Arm-based. We also changed our business model. In the past, it would have been crazy to think Arm would someday get paid $100 for each SoC [system- on-a-chip]. But that is what we are getting after we priced at 50 cents to $1 per core. If you put in 100 cores, we are getting north of $100 on these SoCs. What kind of demand are you seeing for the Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper AI systems? In the last earnings report, you noted how the GH200 will run some of the most demanding AI applications in the world today. It’s very, very strong. Nvidia is pushing it very hard. What Nvidia has done with Grace Hopper is essentially taken 72 to 144 Arm CPU cores, and bolted it to an H100. It replaces the x86 implementation. Nvidia has also done all the CUDA driver work for Arm-based CPUs. It’s great for us that Nvidia is shipping it. What’s the impact to the business going from Armv8 to Armv9? I saw that Armv9 accounted for 15% of royalty revenue in the December quarter from 10% the prior quarter. Is that pace going to keep up? It is. A couple of things to keep in mind on v8 to v9. We’re going to see very, very fast adoption with v9. Everything that we do in servers is v9. It’s more power efficient and has a huge amount of security features. Then in mobile, premium Android is mostly all v9. Over the next couple of years, most Android smartphones will move that way. I expect the other alternative operating system on phones to go that way as well. Then you get into the economics. When we went from v7 to v8, we doubled the royalty rates from about 1%-1.5% to 3%. On v8 to v9, we’ve doubled it again to 5% or close to 6%. It’s a huge tailwind for us in royalty growth. We locked down those v9 contracts in 2020-2021, knowing that starting in 2023, they would start to kick in. Our confidence rate on the sustainability of that is quite high. Intel, under CEO Pat Gelsinger, has prioritized Intel Foundry—to give the market an alternative to Taiwan Semiconductor. How did it feel to be on the stage at Intel’s recent Foundry event, and what do you see from that partnership going forward? I think Intel has realized that for Intel Foundry to be successful, they were going to have to look at where Taiwan Semiconductor was shipping a lot of volume. Intel Foundry executive Stu Pann said 80% of TSMC’s logic wafers have Arm in some shape or form. So partnering with Arm is table stakes for Intel to grow that business. Quite candidly, when I came on board, it was a little chilly between the two companies. I had a lot of meetings with Pat Gelsinger after I started. We came to a meeting of the minds that both companies would benefit, and more broadly, the ecosystem would benefit if we partnered closely. They’ve been great. They’re spending a lot of engineering effort to make sure that the world’s best server chip based on Arm can be built on Intel’s manufacturing process. On one level, that sounds kind of crazy, but they’re quite committed to it. We would love to see them be successful. So let's recap all that BULLISH goodness. Arm is making over $100 per SOC (System on Chip) Nvidia's most high end GPU's are going to be using 144 core ARM chips and ARM is getting paid per Core x86-x64 is getting replaced writ large ARM V9 version 3 is just getting started with it's higher royalty rates going from 10% of total revenue to 15% in the previously reported quarter AWS and increasingly Azure are using ARM based servers in their data cloud offerings. More power per watt, cheaper and more efficient Android is mostly all V9 Intel is getting friendly with ARM to fab it's chip production to compete with TSM and help out Intell in its continued success. ARM Is going into Robotics Next and New AI Edge Devices The Future Runs on ARM - Everything Runs on ARM Positions > 12 shares","My other highest conviction SHORT is Wingstop symbol WING…..shorting anywhere in the $370s or higher is a gift, it is a highly manipulated stock 100% institutional ownership- insane PE that is 3-5 times its peers- the make their revenue on franchise model, but valuation is nonsensical and the company is over 20 years old, over 2200 stores and the growth opportunity is not there, the bull story is a pipe dream and truly nonsense. There is very little opportunity to the upside but large oversized opportunity to the downside- I am short at $376, and haven’t covered yet- the stock usually sells off at earnings and I am hoping it pops because I will add to my short position every time it runs up.My other position that I make a killing on is trading the VIX - I use UVIX which is 2X leveraged play- I loaded the boats as it dropped under $10 and most of position was in the low $8s- I sold at $12 and change - I love trading the VIX when people get complacent it falls and then spook easily when a war or threat happens- could be covid or something that causes sentiment to shift quickly to the negative side. I usually wait for the talking heads at CNBC to tell me how great everything is and then I buy UVIX and dollar cost average in as it falls. It is an easy money maker if you sell the tips and buy the dips, but it is a trade and you must be paying attention and be insightful to recognize the pulse of the market. Sentiment trading is a true skill and takes time to develop but once you do it will be like printing money for your family.",3,0.53,1.0,NEGATIVE

We locked down those v9 contracts in 2020-2021, knowing that starting in 2023, they would start to kick in. Our confidence rate on the sustainability of that is quite high. Intel, under CEO Pat Gelsinger, has prioritized Intel Foundry—to give the market an alternative to Taiwan Semiconductor. How did it feel to be on the stage at Intel’s recent Foundry event, and what do you see from that partnership going forward? I think Intel has realized that for Intel Foundry to be successful, they were going to have to look at where Taiwan Semiconductor was shipping a lot of volume. Intel Foundry executive Stu Pann said 80% of TSMC’s logic wafers have Arm in some shape or form. So partnering with Arm is table stakes for Intel to grow that business. Quite candidly, when I came on board, it was a little chilly between the two companies. I had a lot of meetings with Pat Gelsinger after I started. We came to a meeting of the minds that both companies would benefit, and more broadly, the ecosystem would benefit if we partnered closely. They’ve been great. They’re spending a lot of engineering effort to make sure that the world’s best server chip based on Arm can be built on Intel’s manufacturing process. On one level, that sounds kind of crazy, but they’re quite committed to it. We would love to see them be successful. So let's recap all that BULLISH goodness.

It is truly an amazing time we live in to see the ground floor of these start to take root. Finally, I bring you Barron's (paywall avoiding article) ARM CEO SEES A HUGE TAILWIND FROM NEW CHIPS - NVIDIA & INTEL ARE HELPING TOO written by Tae Kim. Arm’s latest advanced chip technology, called Armv9, generates double the royalty rates of its previous Armv8 products. For some high-end processors, which combine more than 100 “cores,” Arm’s designs are now pulling in more than $100 per chip. It’s a massive change from prior generations. Arm's high-end Chips are earning over $100 per chip. That is a MASSIVE change. Cloud server chips based on Arm technology also benefit from the rapid growth in AI with Nvidia using Arm for its GH200 AI Superchip data center systems. A GH200 Superchip can have up to 144 CPU cores and Arm gets paid for each one. The question for investors now is whether the company’s recent financial performance is sustainable. I, for one, am bullish. Arm’s customers have been willing to pay the higher royalty rates, meaning the boost from Armv9 is likely in the early stages. Further, Arm-based cloud server chips from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others will likely generate robust revenue for years. Outside of Nvidia, Arm may be the best fundamental growth story in technology. Here are edited highlights from my conversation with Haas: Barron’s: Can you talk about Arm’s opportunities in the cloud server data center market. It looks like this business is starting to take off. When we were privatized, we had an opportunity to look at what to do with our investment dollars. With data centers, we noticed several things that we could do. If you want to put together processors, we were lacking a fabric [to weave the network together]. We were lacking certain extension instructions. So we designed CPUs with the right power profile, features, and performance. Then there was a bunch of work that needed to happen in the software ecosystem. The magic moment came when Red Hat announced their Linux distribution for Arm servers. It all came together. Amazon saw it very early. Roughly half of Amazon’s AWS server additions are now Arm-based. We also changed our business model. In the past, it would have been crazy to think Arm would someday get paid $100 for each SoC [system- on-a-chip]. But that is what we are getting after we priced at 50 cents to $1 per core. If you put in 100 cores, we are getting north of $100 on these SoCs. What kind of demand are you seeing for the Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper AI systems? In the last earnings report, you noted how the GH200 will run some of the most demanding AI applications in the world today. It’s very, very strong. Nvidia is pushing it very hard. What Nvidia has done with Grace Hopper is essentially taken 72 to 144 Arm CPU cores, and bolted it to an H100. It replaces the x86 implementation. Nvidia has also done all the CUDA driver work for Arm-based CPUs. It’s great for us that Nvidia is shipping it. What’s the impact to the business going from Armv8 to Armv9? I saw that Armv9 accounted for 15% of royalty revenue in the December quarter from 10% the prior quarter. Is that pace going to keep up? It is. A couple of things to keep in mind on v8 to v9. We’re going to see very, very fast adoption with v9. Everything that we do in servers is v9. It’s more power efficient and has a huge amount of security features. Then in mobile, premium Android is mostly all v9. Over the next couple of years, most Android smartphones will move that way. I expect the other alternative operating system on phones to go that way as well. Then you get into the economics. When we went from v7 to v8, we doubled the royalty rates from about 1%-1.5% to 3%.

It is truly an amazing time we live in to see the ground floor of these start to take root. Finally, I bring you Barron's (paywall avoiding article) ARM CEO SEES A HUGE TAILWIND FROM NEW CHIPS - NVIDIA & INTEL ARE HELPING TOO written by Tae Kim. Arm’s latest advanced chip technology, called Armv9, generates double the royalty rates of its previous Armv8 products. For some high-end processors, which combine more than 100 “cores,” Arm’s designs are now pulling in more than $100 per chip. It’s a massive change from prior generations. Arm's high-end Chips are earning over $100 per chip. That is a MASSIVE change. Cloud server chips based on Arm technology also benefit from the rapid growth in AI with Nvidia using Arm for its GH200 AI Superchip data center systems. A GH200 Superchip can have up to 144 CPU cores and Arm gets paid for each one. The question for investors now is whether the company’s recent financial performance is sustainable. I, for one, am bullish. Arm’s customers have been willing to pay the higher royalty rates, meaning the boost from Armv9 is likely in the early stages. Further, Arm-based cloud server chips from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others will likely generate robust revenue for years. Outside of Nvidia, Arm may be the best fundamental growth story in technology. Here are edited highlights from my conversation with Haas: Barron’s: Can you talk about Arm’s opportunities in the cloud server data center market. It looks like this business is starting to take off. When we were privatized, we had an opportunity to look at what to do with our investment dollars. With data centers, we noticed several things that we could do. If you want to put together processors, we were lacking a fabric [to weave the network together]. We were lacking certain extension instructions. So we designed CPUs with the right power profile, features, and performance. Then there was a bunch of work that needed to happen in the software ecosystem. The magic moment came when Red Hat announced their Linux distribution for Arm servers. It all came together. Amazon saw it very early. Roughly half of Amazon’s AWS server additions are now Arm-based. We also changed our business model. In the past, it would have been crazy to think Arm would someday get paid $100 for each SoC [system- on-a-chip]. But that is what we are getting after we priced at 50 cents to $1 per core. If you put in 100 cores, we are getting north of $100 on these SoCs. What kind of demand are you seeing for the Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper AI systems? In the last earnings report, you noted how the GH200 will run some of the most demanding AI applications in the world today. It’s very, very strong. Nvidia is pushing it very hard. What Nvidia has done with Grace Hopper is essentially taken 72 to 144 Arm CPU cores, and bolted it to an H100. It replaces the x86 implementation. Nvidia has also done all the CUDA driver work for Arm-based CPUs. It’s great for us that Nvidia is shipping it. What’s the impact to the business going from Armv8 to Armv9? I saw that Armv9 accounted for 15% of royalty revenue in the December quarter from 10% the prior quarter. Is that pace going to keep up? It is. A couple of things to keep in mind on v8 to v9. We’re going to see very, very fast adoption with v9. Everything that we do in servers is v9. It’s more power efficient and has a huge amount of security features. Then in mobile, premium Android is mostly all v9. Over the next couple of years, most Android smartphones will move that way. I expect the other alternative operating system on phones to go that way as well. Then you get into the economics. When we went from v7 to v8, we doubled the royalty rates from about 1%-1.5% to 3%. On v8 to v9, we’ve doubled it again to 5% or close to 6%. It’s a huge tailwind for us in royalty growth. We locked down those v9 contracts in 2020-2021, knowing that starting in 2023, they would start to kick in. Our confidence rate on the sustainability of that is quite high. Intel, under CEO Pat Gelsinger, has prioritized Intel Foundry—to give the market an alternative to Taiwan Semiconductor. How did it feel to be on the stage at Intel’s recent Foundry event, and what do you see from that partnership going forward? I think Intel has realized that for Intel Foundry to be successful, they were going to have to look at where Taiwan Semiconductor was shipping a lot of volume. Intel Foundry executive Stu Pann said 80% of TSMC’s logic wafers have Arm in some shape or form. So partnering with Arm is table stakes for Intel to grow that business. Quite candidly, when I came on board, it was a little chilly between the two companies. I had a lot of meetings with Pat Gelsinger after I started. We came to a meeting of the minds that both companies would benefit, and more broadly, the ecosystem would benefit if we partnered closely. They’ve been great. They’re spending a lot of engineering effort to make sure that the world’s best server chip based on Arm can be built on Intel’s manufacturing process. On one level, that sounds kind of crazy, but they’re quite committed to it. We would love to see them be successful. So let's recap all that BULLISH goodness. Arm is making over $100 per SOC (System on Chip) Nvidia's most high end GPU's are going to be using 144 core ARM chips and ARM is getting paid per Core x86-x64 is getting replaced writ large ARM V9 version 3 is just getting started with it's higher royalty rates going from 10% of total revenue to 15% in the previously reported quarter AWS and increasingly Azure are using ARM based servers in their data cloud offerings.

On v8 to v9, we’ve doubled it again to 5% or close to 6%. It’s a huge tailwind for us in royalty growth. We locked down those v9 contracts in 2020-2021, knowing that starting in 2023, they would start to kick in. Our confidence rate on the sustainability of that is quite high. Intel, under CEO Pat Gelsinger, has prioritized Intel Foundry—to give the market an alternative to Taiwan Semiconductor. How did it feel to be on the stage at Intel’s recent Foundry event, and what do you see from that partnership going forward? I think Intel has realized that for Intel Foundry to be successful, they were going to have to look at where Taiwan Semiconductor was shipping a lot of volume. Intel Foundry executive Stu Pann said 80% of TSMC’s logic wafers have Arm in some shape or form. So partnering with Arm is table stakes for Intel to grow that business. Quite candidly, when I came on board, it was a little chilly between the two companies. I had a lot of meetings with Pat Gelsinger after I started. We came to a meeting of the minds that both companies would benefit, and more broadly, the ecosystem would benefit if we partnered closely. They’ve been great. They’re spending a lot of engineering effort to make sure that the world’s best server chip based on Arm can be built on Intel’s manufacturing process. On one level, that sounds kind of crazy, but they’re quite committed to it. We would love to see them be successful. So let's recap all that BULLISH goodness.

This substantially enhances their competitiveness in the market. In summary, Arm's chip applications in the field of delivery robot technology have changed the game, providing unprecedented value and experiences for robot manufacturers and end-users. With further technological advancements, we have reason to believe that Arm will continue to lead the revolution in this field, bringing more surprises and possibilities to the world. It is truly an amazing time we live in to see the ground floor of these start to take root. Finally, I bring you Barron's (paywall avoiding article) ARM CEO SEES A HUGE TAILWIND FROM NEW CHIPS - NVIDIA & INTEL ARE HELPING TOO written by Tae Kim. Arm’s latest advanced chip technology, called Armv9, generates double the royalty rates of its previous Armv8 products. For some high-end processors, which combine more than 100 “cores,” Arm’s designs are now pulling in more than $100 per chip. It’s a massive change from prior generations. Arm's high-end Chips are earning over $100 per chip. That is a MASSIVE change. Cloud server chips based on Arm technology also benefit from the rapid growth in AI with Nvidia using Arm for its GH200 AI Superchip data center systems. A GH200 Superchip can have up to 144 CPU cores and Arm gets paid for each one. The question for investors now is whether the company’s recent financial performance is sustainable. I, for one, am bullish. Arm’s customers have been willing to pay the higher royalty rates, meaning the boost from Armv9 is likely in the early stages. Further, Arm-based cloud server chips from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others will likely generate robust revenue for years. Outside of Nvidia, Arm may be the best fundamental growth story in technology. Here are edited highlights from my conversation with Haas: Barron’s: Can you talk about Arm’s opportunities in the cloud server data center market. It looks like this business is starting to take off. When we were privatized, we had an opportunity to look at what to do with our investment dollars. With data centers, we noticed several things that we could do. If you want to put together processors, we were lacking a fabric [to weave the network together]. We were lacking certain extension instructions. So we designed CPUs with the right power profile, features, and performance. Then there was a bunch of work that needed to happen in the software ecosystem. The magic moment came when Red Hat announced their Linux distribution for Arm servers. It all came together. Amazon saw it very early. Roughly half of Amazon’s AWS server additions are now Arm-based. We also changed our business model. In the past, it would have been crazy to think Arm would someday get paid $100 for each SoC [system- on-a-chip]. But that is what we are getting after we priced at 50 cents to $1 per core. If you put in 100 cores, we are getting north of $100 on these SoCs. What kind of demand are you seeing for the Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper AI systems? In the last earnings report, you noted how the GH200 will run some of the most demanding AI applications in the world today. It’s very, very strong. Nvidia is pushing it very hard. What Nvidia has done with Grace Hopper is essentially taken 72 to 144 Arm CPU cores, and bolted it to an H100. It replaces the x86 implementation. Nvidia has also done all the CUDA driver work for Arm-based CPUs. It’s great for us that Nvidia is shipping it. What’s the impact to the business going from Armv8 to Armv9? I saw that Armv9 accounted for 15% of royalty revenue in the December quarter from 10% the prior quarter. Is that pace going to keep up? It is. A couple of things to keep in mind on v8 to v9. We’re going to see very, very fast adoption with v9. Everything that we do in servers is v9. It’s more power efficient and has a huge amount of security features. Then in mobile, premium Android is mostly all v9. Over the next couple of years, most Android smartphones will move that way. I expect the other alternative operating system on phones to go that way as well. Then you get into the economics. When we went from v7 to v8, we doubled the royalty rates from about 1%-1.5% to 3%.

With further technological advancements, we have reason to believe that Arm will continue to lead the revolution in this field, bringing more surprises and possibilities to the world. It is truly an amazing time we live in to see the ground floor of these start to take root. Finally, I bring you Barron's (paywall avoiding article) ARM CEO SEES A HUGE TAILWIND FROM NEW CHIPS - NVIDIA & INTEL ARE HELPING TOO written by Tae Kim. Arm’s latest advanced chip technology, called Armv9, generates double the royalty rates of its previous Armv8 products. For some high-end processors, which combine more than 100 “cores,” Arm’s designs are now pulling in more than $100 per chip. It’s a massive change from prior generations. Arm's high-end Chips are earning over $100 per chip. That is a MASSIVE change. Cloud server chips based on Arm technology also benefit from the rapid growth in AI with Nvidia using Arm for its GH200 AI Superchip data center systems. A GH200 Superchip can have up to 144 CPU cores and Arm gets paid for each one. The question for investors now is whether the company’s recent financial performance is sustainable. I, for one, am bullish. Arm’s customers have been willing to pay the higher royalty rates, meaning the boost from Armv9 is likely in the early stages. Further, Arm-based cloud server chips from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others will likely generate robust revenue for years. Outside of Nvidia, Arm may be the best fundamental growth story in technology. Here are edited highlights from my conversation with Haas: Barron’s: Can you talk about Arm’s opportunities in the cloud server data center market. It looks like this business is starting to take off. When we were privatized, we had an opportunity to look at what to do with our investment dollars. With data centers, we noticed several things that we could do. If you want to put together processors, we were lacking a fabric [to weave the network together]. We were lacking certain extension instructions. So we designed CPUs with the right power profile, features, and performance. Then there was a bunch of work that needed to happen in the software ecosystem. The magic moment came when Red Hat announced their Linux distribution for Arm servers. It all came together. Amazon saw it very early. Roughly half of Amazon’s AWS server additions are now Arm-based. We also changed our business model. In the past, it would have been crazy to think Arm would someday get paid $100 for each SoC [system- on-a-chip]. But that is what we are getting after we priced at 50 cents to $1 per core. If you put in 100 cores, we are getting north of $100 on these SoCs. What kind of demand are you seeing for the Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper AI systems? In the last earnings report, you noted how the GH200 will run some of the most demanding AI applications in the world today. It’s very, very strong. Nvidia is pushing it very hard. What Nvidia has done with Grace Hopper is essentially taken 72 to 144 Arm CPU cores, and bolted it to an H100. It replaces the x86 implementation. Nvidia has also done all the CUDA driver work for Arm-based CPUs. It’s great for us that Nvidia is shipping it. What’s the impact to the business going from Armv8 to Armv9? I saw that Armv9 accounted for 15% of royalty revenue in the December quarter from 10% the prior quarter. Is that pace going to keep up? It is. A couple of things to keep in mind on v8 to v9. We’re going to see very, very fast adoption with v9. Everything that we do in servers is v9. It’s more power efficient and has a huge amount of security features. Then in mobile, premium Android is mostly all v9. Over the next couple of years, most Android smartphones will move that way. I expect the other alternative operating system on phones to go that way as well. Then you get into the economics. When we went from v7 to v8, we doubled the royalty rates from about 1%-1.5% to 3%. On v8 to v9, we’ve doubled it again to 5% or close to 6%. It’s a huge tailwind for us in royalty growth. We locked down those v9 contracts in 2020-2021, knowing that starting in 2023, they would start to kick in. Our confidence rate on the sustainability of that is quite high. Intel, under CEO Pat Gelsinger, has prioritized Intel Foundry—to give the market an alternative to Taiwan Semiconductor. How did it feel to be on the stage at Intel’s recent Foundry event, and what do you see from that partnership going forward? I think Intel has realized that for Intel Foundry to be successful, they were going to have to look at where Taiwan Semiconductor was shipping a lot of volume. Intel Foundry executive Stu Pann said 80% of TSMC’s logic wafers have Arm in some shape or form. So partnering with Arm is table stakes for Intel to grow that business. Quite candidly, when I came on board, it was a little chilly between the two companies. I had a lot of meetings with Pat Gelsinger after I started. We came to a meeting of the minds that both companies would benefit, and more broadly, the ecosystem would benefit if we partnered closely. They’ve been great. They’re spending a lot of engineering effort to make sure that the world’s best server chip based on Arm can be built on Intel’s manufacturing process. On one level, that sounds kind of crazy, but they’re quite committed to it. We would love to see them be successful. So let's recap all that BULLISH goodness. Arm is making over $100 per SOC (System on Chip) Nvidia's most high end GPU's are going to be using 144 core ARM chips and ARM is getting paid per Core x86-x64 is getting replaced writ large ARM V9 version 3 is just getting started with it's higher royalty rates going from 10% of total revenue to 15% in the previously reported quarter AWS and increasingly Azure are using ARM based servers in their data cloud offerings.

Further, Arm-based cloud server chips from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others will likely generate robust revenue for years. Outside of Nvidia, Arm may be the best fundamental growth story in technology. Here are edited highlights from my conversation with Haas: Barron’s: Can you talk about Arm’s opportunities in the cloud server data center market. It looks like this business is starting to take off. When we were privatized, we had an opportunity to look at what to do with our investment dollars. With data centers, we noticed several things that we could do. If you want to put together processors, we were lacking a fabric [to weave the network together]. We were lacking certain extension instructions. So we designed CPUs with the right power profile, features, and performance. Then there was a bunch of work that needed to happen in the software ecosystem. The magic moment came when Red Hat announced their Linux distribution for Arm servers. It all came together. Amazon saw it very early. Roughly half of Amazon’s AWS server additions are now Arm-based. We also changed our business model. In the past, it would have been crazy to think Arm would someday get paid $100 for each SoC [system- on-a-chip]. But that is what we are getting after we priced at 50 cents to $1 per core. If you put in 100 cores, we are getting north of $100 on these SoCs. What kind of demand are you seeing for the Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper AI systems? In the last earnings report, you noted how the GH200 will run some of the most demanding AI applications in the world today. It’s very, very strong. Nvidia is pushing it very hard. What Nvidia has done with Grace Hopper is essentially taken 72 to 144 Arm CPU cores, and bolted it to an H100. It replaces the x86 implementation. Nvidia has also done all the CUDA driver work for Arm-based CPUs. It’s great for us that Nvidia is shipping it. What’s the impact to the business going from Armv8 to Armv9? I saw that Armv9 accounted for 15% of royalty revenue in the December quarter from 10% the prior quarter. Is that pace going to keep up? It is. A couple of things to keep in mind on v8 to v9. We’re going to see very, very fast adoption with v9. Everything that we do in servers is v9. It’s more power efficient and has a huge amount of security features. Then in mobile, premium Android is mostly all v9. Over the next couple of years, most Android smartphones will move that way. I expect the other alternative operating system on phones to go that way as well. Then you get into the economics. When we went from v7 to v8, we doubled the royalty rates from about 1%-1.5% to 3%. On v8 to v9, we’ve doubled it again to 5% or close to 6%. It’s a huge tailwind for us in royalty growth. We locked down those v9 contracts in 2020-2021, knowing that starting in 2023, they would start to kick in. Our confidence rate on the sustainability of that is quite high. Intel, under CEO Pat Gelsinger, has prioritized Intel Foundry—to give the market an alternative to Taiwan Semiconductor. How did it feel to be on the stage at Intel’s recent Foundry event, and what do you see from that partnership going forward? I think Intel has realized that for Intel Foundry to be successful, they were going to have to look at where Taiwan Semiconductor was shipping a lot of volume. Intel Foundry executive Stu Pann said 80% of TSMC’s logic wafers have Arm in some shape or form. So partnering with Arm is table stakes for Intel to grow that business. Quite candidly, when I came on board, it was a little chilly between the two companies. I had a lot of meetings with Pat Gelsinger after I started. We came to a meeting of the minds that both companies would benefit, and more broadly, the ecosystem would benefit if we partnered closely. They’ve been great. They’re spending a lot of engineering effort to make sure that the world’s best server chip based on Arm can be built on Intel’s manufacturing process. On one level, that sounds kind of crazy, but they’re quite committed to it. We would love to see them be successful. So let's recap all that BULLISH goodness. Arm is making over $100 per SOC (System on Chip) Nvidia's most high end GPU's are going to be using 144 core ARM chips and ARM is getting paid per Core x86-x64 is getting replaced writ large ARM V9 version 3 is just getting started with it's higher royalty rates going from 10% of total revenue to 15% in the previously reported quarter AWS and increasingly Azure are using ARM based servers in their data cloud offerings.

It is truly an amazing time we live in to see the ground floor of these start to take root. Finally, I bring you Barron's (paywall avoiding article) ARM CEO SEES A HUGE TAILWIND FROM NEW CHIPS - NVIDIA & INTEL ARE HELPING TOO written by Tae Kim. Arm’s latest advanced chip technology, called Armv9, generates double the royalty rates of its previous Armv8 products. For some high-end processors, which combine more than 100 “cores,” Arm’s designs are now pulling in more than $100 per chip. It’s a massive change from prior generations. Arm's high-end Chips are earning over $100 per chip. That is a MASSIVE change. Cloud server chips based on Arm technology also benefit from the rapid growth in AI with Nvidia using Arm for its GH200 AI Superchip data center systems. A GH200 Superchip can have up to 144 CPU cores and Arm gets paid for each one. The question for investors now is whether the company’s recent financial performance is sustainable. I, for one, am bullish. Arm’s customers have been willing to pay the higher royalty rates, meaning the boost from Armv9 is likely in the early stages. Further, Arm-based cloud server chips from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others will likely generate robust revenue for years. Outside of Nvidia, Arm may be the best fundamental growth story in technology. Here are edited highlights from my conversation with Haas: Barron’s: Can you talk about Arm’s opportunities in the cloud server data center market. It looks like this business is starting to take off. When we were privatized, we had an opportunity to look at what to do with our investment dollars. With data centers, we noticed several things that we could do. If you want to put together processors, we were lacking a fabric [to weave the network together]. We were lacking certain extension instructions. So we designed CPUs with the right power profile, features, and performance. Then there was a bunch of work that needed to happen in the software ecosystem. The magic moment came when Red Hat announced their Linux distribution for Arm servers. It all came together. Amazon saw it very early. Roughly half of Amazon’s AWS server additions are now Arm-based. We also changed our business model. In the past, it would have been crazy to think Arm would someday get paid $100 for each SoC [system- on-a-chip]. But that is what we are getting after we priced at 50 cents to $1 per core. If you put in 100 cores, we are getting north of $100 on these SoCs. What kind of demand are you seeing for the Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper AI systems? In the last earnings report, you noted how the GH200 will run some of the most demanding AI applications in the world today. It’s very, very strong. Nvidia is pushing it very hard. What Nvidia has done with Grace Hopper is essentially taken 72 to 144 Arm CPU cores, and bolted it to an H100. It replaces the x86 implementation. Nvidia has also done all the CUDA driver work for Arm-based CPUs. It’s great for us that Nvidia is shipping it. What’s the impact to the business going from Armv8 to Armv9? I saw that Armv9 accounted for 15% of royalty revenue in the December quarter from 10% the prior quarter. Is that pace going to keep up? It is. A couple of things to keep in mind on v8 to v9. We’re going to see very, very fast adoption with v9. Everything that we do in servers is v9. It’s more power efficient and has a huge amount of security features. Then in mobile, premium Android is mostly all v9. Over the next couple of years, most Android smartphones will move that way. I expect the other alternative operating system on phones to go that way as well. Then you get into the economics. When we went from v7 to v8, we doubled the royalty rates from about 1%-1.5% to 3%. On v8 to v9, we’ve doubled it again to 5% or close to 6%. It’s a huge tailwind for us in royalty growth. We locked down those v9 contracts in 2020-2021, knowing that starting in 2023, they would start to kick in. Our confidence rate on the sustainability of that is quite high. Intel, under CEO Pat Gelsinger, has prioritized Intel Foundry—to give the market an alternative to Taiwan Semiconductor. How did it feel to be on the stage at Intel’s recent Foundry event, and what do you see from that partnership going forward? I think Intel has realized that for Intel Foundry to be successful, they were going to have to look at where Taiwan Semiconductor was shipping a lot of volume. Intel Foundry executive Stu Pann said 80% of TSMC’s logic wafers have Arm in some shape or form. So partnering with Arm is table stakes for Intel to grow that business. Quite candidly, when I came on board, it was a little chilly between the two companies. I had a lot of meetings with Pat Gelsinger after I started. We came to a meeting of the minds that both companies would benefit, and more broadly, the ecosystem would benefit if we partnered closely. They’ve been great. They’re spending a lot of engineering effort to make sure that the world’s best server chip based on Arm can be built on Intel’s manufacturing process. On one level, that sounds kind of crazy, but they’re quite committed to it. We would love to see them be successful. So let's recap all that BULLISH goodness. Arm is making over $100 per SOC (System on Chip) Nvidia's most high end GPU's are going to be using 144 core ARM chips and ARM is getting paid per Core x86-x64 is getting replaced writ large ARM V9 version 3 is just getting started with it's higher royalty rates going from 10% of total revenue to 15% in the previously reported quarter AWS and increasingly Azure are using ARM based servers in their data cloud offerings.

ARM Is going into Robotics Next and New AI Edge Devices The Future Runs on ARM - Everything Runs on ARM Positions > 12 shares","The stark reality is this industry is the purest definition of cut throat. As Arm increases royalties current clients work hard on ways to phase them out, plain and simple-the amount of RnD going on with current ARM customers is quite concerning. Arm has 99% of phone market and large portions of IOT it is hard to grow unless Arms own RnD division shines. The PE will not matter until it matters and when that day comes this has a chance to crater. I am not a bear but there is more of a chance for downside than massive upside at this point in company history- I look for SoftBank to unload blocks of shares and use the capital to shore up their massive losses over the last few years(do research SoftBank) and ultimately those sales will hit the market creating downward pressure. The most likely models show significant pressure to the downside. If you play this, you want to short or puts in the short term because when sell in May and walk away gets here there absolutely will be downward pressure and momentum. It should be a long term solid company to own but at current price there is nowhere to go- think about it, if you couldn’t find a private buyer for 40 billion, how likely is it to find a buyer at 135 billion?

It is truly an amazing time we live in to see the ground floor of these start to take root. Finally, I bring you Barron's (paywall avoiding article) ARM CEO SEES A HUGE TAILWIND FROM NEW CHIPS - NVIDIA & INTEL ARE HELPING TOO written by Tae Kim. Arm’s latest advanced chip technology, called Armv9, generates double the royalty rates of its previous Armv8 products. For some high-end processors, which combine more than 100 “cores,” Arm’s designs are now pulling in more than $100 per chip. It’s a massive change from prior generations. Arm's high-end Chips are earning over $100 per chip. That is a MASSIVE change. Cloud server chips based on Arm technology also benefit from the rapid growth in AI with Nvidia using Arm for its GH200 AI Superchip data center systems. A GH200 Superchip can have up to 144 CPU cores and Arm gets paid for each one. The question for investors now is whether the company’s recent financial performance is sustainable. I, for one, am bullish. Arm’s customers have been willing to pay the higher royalty rates, meaning the boost from Armv9 is likely in the early stages. Further, Arm-based cloud server chips from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others will likely generate robust revenue for years. Outside of Nvidia, Arm may be the best fundamental growth story in technology. Here are edited highlights from my conversation with Haas: Barron’s: Can you talk about Arm’s opportunities in the cloud server data center market. It looks like this business is starting to take off. When we were privatized, we had an opportunity to look at what to do with our investment dollars. With data centers, we noticed several things that we could do. If you want to put together processors, we were lacking a fabric [to weave the network together]. We were lacking certain extension instructions. So we designed CPUs with the right power profile, features, and performance. Then there was a bunch of work that needed to happen in the software ecosystem. The magic moment came when Red Hat announced their Linux distribution for Arm servers. It all came together. Amazon saw it very early. Roughly half of Amazon’s AWS server additions are now Arm-based. We also changed our business model. In the past, it would have been crazy to think Arm would someday get paid $100 for each SoC [system- on-a-chip]. But that is what we are getting after we priced at 50 cents to $1 per core. If you put in 100 cores, we are getting north of $100 on these SoCs. What kind of demand are you seeing for the Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper AI systems? In the last earnings report, you noted how the GH200 will run some of the most demanding AI applications in the world today. It’s very, very strong. Nvidia is pushing it very hard. What Nvidia has done with Grace Hopper is essentially taken 72 to 144 Arm CPU cores, and bolted it to an H100. It replaces the x86 implementation. Nvidia has also done all the CUDA driver work for Arm-based CPUs. It’s great for us that Nvidia is shipping it. What’s the impact to the business going from Armv8 to Armv9? I saw that Armv9 accounted for 15% of royalty revenue in the December quarter from 10% the prior quarter. Is that pace going to keep up? It is. A couple of things to keep in mind on v8 to v9. We’re going to see very, very fast adoption with v9. Everything that we do in servers is v9. It’s more power efficient and has a huge amount of security features. Then in mobile, premium Android is mostly all v9. Over the next couple of years, most Android smartphones will move that way. I expect the other alternative operating system on phones to go that way as well. Then you get into the economics. When we went from v7 to v8, we doubled the royalty rates from about 1%-1.5% to 3%. On v8 to v9, we’ve doubled it again to 5% or close to 6%. It’s a huge tailwind for us in royalty growth. We locked down those v9 contracts in 2020-2021, knowing that starting in 2023, they would start to kick in. Our confidence rate on the sustainability of that is quite high. Intel, under CEO Pat Gelsinger, has prioritized Intel Foundry—to give the market an alternative to Taiwan Semiconductor. How did it feel to be on the stage at Intel’s recent Foundry event, and what do you see from that partnership going forward? I think Intel has realized that for Intel Foundry to be successful, they were going to have to look at where Taiwan Semiconductor was shipping a lot of volume. Intel Foundry executive Stu Pann said 80% of TSMC’s logic wafers have Arm in some shape or form. So partnering with Arm is table stakes for Intel to grow that business. Quite candidly, when I came on board, it was a little chilly between the two companies. I had a lot of meetings with Pat Gelsinger after I started. We came to a meeting of the minds that both companies would benefit, and more broadly, the ecosystem would benefit if we partnered closely. They’ve been great. They’re spending a lot of engineering effort to make sure that the world’s best server chip based on Arm can be built on Intel’s manufacturing process. On one level, that sounds kind of crazy, but they’re quite committed to it. We would love to see them be successful. So let's recap all that BULLISH goodness. Arm is making over $100 per SOC (System on Chip) Nvidia's most high end GPU's are going to be using 144 core ARM chips and ARM is getting paid per Core x86-x64 is getting replaced writ large ARM V9 version 3 is just getting started with it's higher royalty rates going from 10% of total revenue to 15% in the previously reported quarter AWS and increasingly Azure are using ARM based servers in their data cloud offerings. More power per watt, cheaper and more efficient Android is mostly all V9 Intel is getting friendly with ARM to fab it's chip production to compete with TSM and help out Intell in its continued success.

Nvidia has also done all the CUDA driver work for Arm-based CPUs. It’s great for us that Nvidia is shipping it. What’s the impact to the business going from Armv8 to Armv9? I saw that Armv9 accounted for 15% of royalty revenue in the December quarter from 10% the prior quarter. Is that pace going to keep up? It is. A couple of things to keep in mind on v8 to v9. We’re going to see very, very fast adoption with v9. Everything that we do in servers is v9. It’s more power efficient and has a huge amount of security features. Then in mobile, premium Android is mostly all v9. Over the next couple of years, most Android smartphones will move that way. I expect the other alternative operating system on phones to go that way as well. Then you get into the economics. When we went from v7 to v8, we doubled the royalty rates from about 1%-1.5% to 3%. On v8 to v9, we’ve doubled it again to 5% or close to 6%. It’s a huge tailwind for us in royalty growth. We locked down those v9 contracts in 2020-2021, knowing that starting in 2023, they would start to kick in. Our confidence rate on the sustainability of that is quite high. Intel, under CEO Pat Gelsinger, has prioritized Intel Foundry—to give the market an alternative to Taiwan Semiconductor. How did it feel to be on the stage at Intel’s recent Foundry event, and what do you see from that partnership going forward? I think Intel has realized that for Intel Foundry to be successful, they were going to have to look at where Taiwan Semiconductor was shipping a lot of volume. Intel Foundry executive Stu Pann said 80% of TSMC’s logic wafers have Arm in some shape or form. So partnering with Arm is table stakes for Intel to grow that business. Quite candidly, when I came on board, it was a little chilly between the two companies. I had a lot of meetings with Pat Gelsinger after I started. We came to a meeting of the minds that both companies would benefit, and more broadly, the ecosystem would benefit if we partnered closely. They’ve been great. They’re spending a lot of engineering effort to make sure that the world’s best server chip based on Arm can be built on Intel’s manufacturing process. On one level, that sounds kind of crazy, but they’re quite committed to it. We would love to see them be successful. So let's recap all that BULLISH goodness. Arm is making over $100 per SOC (System on Chip) Nvidia's most high end GPU's are going to be using 144 core ARM chips and ARM is getting paid per Core x86-x64 is getting replaced writ large ARM V9 version 3 is just getting started with it's higher royalty rates going from 10% of total revenue to 15% in the previously reported quarter AWS and increasingly Azure are using ARM based servers in their data cloud offerings.

In summary, Arm's chip applications in the field of delivery robot technology have changed the game, providing unprecedented value and experiences for robot manufacturers and end-users. With further technological advancements, we have reason to believe that Arm will continue to lead the revolution in this field, bringing more surprises and possibilities to the world. It is truly an amazing time we live in to see the ground floor of these start to take root. Finally, I bring you Barron's (paywall avoiding article) ARM CEO SEES A HUGE TAILWIND FROM NEW CHIPS - NVIDIA & INTEL ARE HELPING TOO written by Tae Kim. Arm’s latest advanced chip technology, called Armv9, generates double the royalty rates of its previous Armv8 products. For some high-end processors, which combine more than 100 “cores,” Arm’s designs are now pulling in more than $100 per chip. It’s a massive change from prior generations. Arm's high-end Chips are earning over $100 per chip. That is a MASSIVE change. Cloud server chips based on Arm technology also benefit from the rapid growth in AI with Nvidia using Arm for its GH200 AI Superchip data center systems. A GH200 Superchip can have up to 144 CPU cores and Arm gets paid for each one. The question for investors now is whether the company’s recent financial performance is sustainable. I, for one, am bullish. Arm’s customers have been willing to pay the higher royalty rates, meaning the boost from Armv9 is likely in the early stages. Further, Arm-based cloud server chips from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others will likely generate robust revenue for years. Outside of Nvidia, Arm may be the best fundamental growth story in technology. Here are edited highlights from my conversation with Haas: Barron’s: Can you talk about Arm’s opportunities in the cloud server data center market. It looks like this business is starting to take off. When we were privatized, we had an opportunity to look at what to do with our investment dollars. With data centers, we noticed several things that we could do. If you want to put together processors, we were lacking a fabric [to weave the network together]. We were lacking certain extension instructions. So we designed CPUs with the right power profile, features, and performance. Then there was a bunch of work that needed to happen in the software ecosystem. The magic moment came when Red Hat announced their Linux distribution for Arm servers. It all came together. Amazon saw it very early. Roughly half of Amazon’s AWS server additions are now Arm-based. We also changed our business model. In the past, it would have been crazy to think Arm would someday get paid $100 for each SoC [system- on-a-chip]. But that is what we are getting after we priced at 50 cents to $1 per core. If you put in 100 cores, we are getting north of $100 on these SoCs. What kind of demand are you seeing for the Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper AI systems? In the last earnings report, you noted how the GH200 will run some of the most demanding AI applications in the world today. It’s very, very strong. Nvidia is pushing it very hard.

And the confabulation that Arm's parent company SoftBank would simply UNLOAD billions and billions of shares and simply dilute and pummel the Arm stock into submission. BRACE YOURSELF FOR A SELL OFF https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-12/arm-traders-brace-for-a-selloff-as-lockup-lifts-after-big-rally?embedded-checkout=true https://investorplace.com/2024/03/arm-stock-alert-brace-yourself-for-a-selloff-as-arm-lock-up-expires/ I was fearful, not going to lie. But I held Diamond hands and decided that I would not hedge or buy puts or short positions for a temporary ""feared"" sell-off. I am here to tell you. ARM Held - NOT GIVING A DAMN INCH of pull back. SoftBank protected the ARM Holdings position and did NOT let the stock go below $125. Look at the tiny trade volume standing tall. That GREEN Wall of protection ensued a wonderful and grande blockaide against puts and short sellers and profit takers. In the words of Karp (PLTR) - I love watching short sellers crumble and things about their drug dealers (some shit like that.) Look at the volume a day / 2 days later. Nothing much. Their is not a major sell off AT ALL. ARM has passed the lock-up period test. Oh and before we go to the Barron's DD I wanted to share with you something spectacular. In this video. I want you to realize how profound of a time you are living in where we can do this technology. It is truly mind-blowing. And what you must understand is that ARM is and will be at the forefront of this. The way the robot see's the world, can think about the world and speak and interact with the world will all be done on ARM CPU's and GPU's. Behold Figure AI with OpenAI ChatGPT deep integration. 0:00 / 0:00 This is the future and AI chips will be in this robotic control plane. From Tesla's Optimus to Figure AI 01 to the multitude of lesser and perhaps cheaper versions will all be powered by efficient and accelerated compute localized to the corresponding robotic device. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-innovations-has-chip-giant-arm-brought-delivery-robot/ Most importantly, Arm's highly integrated and low-power characteristics make delivery robots more compact and durable while significantly reducing manufacturing costs. This substantially enhances their competitiveness in the market. In summary, Arm's chip applications in the field of delivery robot technology have changed the game, providing unprecedented value and experiences for robot manufacturers and end-users. With further technological advancements, we have reason to believe that Arm will continue to lead the revolution in this field, bringing more surprises and possibilities to the world. It is truly an amazing time we live in to see the ground floor of these start to take root. Finally, I bring you Barron's (paywall avoiding article) ARM CEO SEES A HUGE TAILWIND FROM NEW CHIPS - NVIDIA & INTEL ARE HELPING TOO written by Tae Kim. Arm’s latest advanced chip technology, called Armv9, generates double the royalty rates of its previous Armv8 products. For some high-end processors, which combine more than 100 “cores,” Arm’s designs are now pulling in more than $100 per chip. It’s a massive change from prior generations. Arm's high-end Chips are earning over $100 per chip. That is a MASSIVE change. Cloud server chips based on Arm technology also benefit from the rapid growth in AI with Nvidia using Arm for its GH200 AI Superchip data center systems. A GH200 Superchip can have up to 144 CPU cores and Arm gets paid for each one. The question for investors now is whether the company’s recent financial performance is sustainable. I, for one, am bullish. Arm’s customers have been willing to pay the higher royalty rates, meaning the boost from Armv9 is likely in the early stages. Further, Arm-based cloud server chips from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others will likely generate robust revenue for years. Outside of Nvidia, Arm may be the best fundamental growth story in technology. Here are edited highlights from my conversation with Haas: Barron’s: Can you talk about Arm’s opportunities in the cloud server data center market. It looks like this business is starting to take off. When we were privatized, we had an opportunity to look at what to do with our investment dollars. With data centers, we noticed several things that we could do. If you want to put together processors, we were lacking a fabric [to weave the network together]. We were lacking certain extension instructions. So we designed CPUs with the right power profile, features, and performance. Then there was a bunch of work that needed to happen in the software ecosystem. The magic moment came when Red Hat announced their Linux distribution for Arm servers. It all came together. Amazon saw it very early. Roughly half of Amazon’s AWS server additions are now Arm-based. We also changed our business model. In the past, it would have been crazy to think Arm would someday get paid $100 for each SoC [system- on-a-chip]. But that is what we are getting after we priced at 50 cents to $1 per core. If you put in 100 cores, we are getting north of $100 on these SoCs. What kind of demand are you seeing for the Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper AI systems? In the last earnings report, you noted how the GH200 will run some of the most demanding AI applications in the world today. It’s very, very strong. Nvidia is pushing it very hard. What Nvidia has done with Grace Hopper is essentially taken 72 to 144 Arm CPU cores, and bolted it to an H100. It replaces the x86 implementation. Nvidia has also done all the CUDA driver work for Arm-based CPUs. It’s great for us that Nvidia is shipping it. What’s the impact to the business going from Armv8 to Armv9? I saw that Armv9 accounted for 15% of royalty revenue in the December quarter from 10% the prior quarter. Is that pace going to keep up? It is. A couple of things to keep in mind on v8 to v9. We’re going to see very, very fast adoption with v9. Everything that we do in servers is v9. It’s more power efficient and has a huge amount of security features. Then in mobile, premium Android is mostly all v9. Over the next couple of years, most Android smartphones will move that way. I expect the other alternative operating system on phones to go that way as well. Then you get into the economics. When we went from v7 to v8, we doubled the royalty rates from about 1%-1.5% to 3%. On v8 to v9, we’ve doubled it again to 5% or close to 6%. It’s a huge tailwind for us in royalty growth. We locked down those v9 contracts in 2020-2021, knowing that starting in 2023, they would start to kick in. Our confidence rate on the sustainability of that is quite high. Intel, under CEO Pat Gelsinger, has prioritized Intel Foundry—to give the market an alternative to Taiwan Semiconductor. How did it feel to be on the stage at Intel’s recent Foundry event, and what do you see from that partnership going forward? I think Intel has realized that for Intel Foundry to be successful, they were going to have to look at where Taiwan Semiconductor was shipping a lot of volume. Intel Foundry executive Stu Pann said 80% of TSMC’s logic wafers have Arm in some shape or form. So partnering with Arm is table stakes for Intel to grow that business. Quite candidly, when I came on board, it was a little chilly between the two companies. I had a lot of meetings with Pat Gelsinger after I started. We came to a meeting of the minds that both companies would benefit, and more broadly, the ecosystem would benefit if we partnered closely. They’ve been great. They’re spending a lot of engineering effort to make sure that the world’s best server chip based on Arm can be built on Intel’s manufacturing process. On one level, that sounds kind of crazy, but they’re quite committed to it. We would love to see them be successful. So let's recap all that BULLISH goodness. Arm is making over $100 per SOC (System on Chip) Nvidia's most high end GPU's are going to be using 144 core ARM chips and ARM is getting paid per Core x86-x64 is getting replaced writ large ARM V9 version 3 is just getting started with it's higher royalty rates going from 10% of total revenue to 15% in the previously reported quarter AWS and increasingly Azure are using ARM based servers in their data cloud offerings. More power per watt, cheaper and more efficient Android is mostly all V9 Intel is getting friendly with ARM to fab it's chip production to compete with TSM and help out Intell in its continued success.
