,"Hi regards, This is not a ""copium"" post about the recent stock price drops. I am a 3rd world country regard who is a Software Engineer and I will share my insights into the industry with my broken ass English, if you want to join me on this journey, be my guest. The problem with NVDA is that they are ""overhyped"" not ""overpriced"". Some of you regards might say that ""OH THEIR STOCK PRICE INCREASED 150% YOY HOW IS THAT NOT OVERPRICED"", I will kindly ask you to check their income growth, which sits at 122% YOY. First of all, lets compare some other tech giants earnings to NVDA earnings to see what they are ""worth now"". Name Stock price EPS SP/EPS ratio AAPL 230 1,4 164 MSFT 413 2,95 140 AMD 145 0,16 1.035 META 516 5,16 100 AMZN 171 1,26 135 NVDA 116 0,68 170 As you can see above, they are not overpriced related to their current earnings. And I think that them going back to 110 will set them good for later improvements. But them getting hyped beyond recognition was the sole reason for them being priced at 130 per price. But before jumping into the NVDA analysis, lets go over every single tech stock in that list. AAPL Latest thing they achieved was M1 chip, converting old and worthless Macbook Pro hardware into a performing machine with great battery life. This was also accompanied by the fact that they can charge a premium for small hardware upgrades (200$ for a simple 256GB storage?), which helped them to sell new computers to their old customers and gain huge profits. How do I know this? Because after 2021, when M1 chip proved to be powerful and resourceful, most of our Macbook stack got renewed. I was using a 6 years old work Macbook before that, because newer Intel Macbooks did not promise anything new. But this was 3 years ago. Now, they are pretty much failing to create new income markets. Their latest tech demo ""Vision Pro"" failed miserably. Their only means to increase their income is to sell more hardware to push their services (AppStore and stuff), but this is also under investigation and they probably will have to open up their ecosystem more. MSFT They did suck tits before Nadella became a CEO. They tried to be a ""everything"" company but everything they did suck. Then Nadella came and transformed the rotting corpse of MSFT on the Golden Throne into the Cloud giant they are. They are platformless. Their services are used everywhere. They are bringing Windows into ARM devices (again) and it does not suck this time. New ARM platform seems to outperform M series Macbooks in battery performance, which will end years of Macbook supremacy. They are agile. They set and integrate trends easier. Game Pass? Azure? Cloud Office? AMD I am a fellow AMD user (7900XTX gang?) and oh boy they are at least a few years behind in datacenter solutions. Also given their driver problem history on Desktop, power draw problems and other bugs, they need more resources to fix their problems first. Also, sadly, they do not have CUDA. Personally, I am training some neural networks on my 7900XTX and it is 5 to 10 times faster than my CPU but also 5 to 10 times slower than NVDA counterpart. And also, I have to put in the extra work to find that specific framework that works with AMD and make the very specific adjustments before even I can start using the hardware. Even if their hardware can match NVDA, it is like having a really fast fighter jet without any software assistance, yeah you can MAYBE safely take off if you work hard enough, but you will never win against the jest with a strong software. And no one is buying their data center products (Other than their CPU's). I will get on this in NVDA's section. META They are a ""AD"" company, just like Google. They have some ""long game"" products (Metaverse and Google Self Driving as much as you joke them), but they are far from ALPHA phase. If they can show the world that this is the future, they might get a 60% to 90% increase in their value. ALSO THEY ARE BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WORTH NVDA PRODUCTS. AMZN The ""everything company"". They are big. But not as much profitable as the rest. For me, their biggest product is AWS. If they can create a new income source they will be the next 3T company, may be even earlier than GOOGL. NVDA AND OUR STAR CHILD. HOT TOPIC OF 2024. THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD. Do you remember when they wanted to acquire ARM? This was back in 2020, when their market cap was around 145 BILLION. Do you know how much they were willing to spend on ARM? 40 BILLION DOLLARS. This was before the AI craze and boom in their revenue. So why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU's of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace. Remember what I told you in AAPL's section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now? H100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell. And I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD. This was because in our company, we have bought A MILLION DOLLARS worth of NVDA datacenter products. There was a discussion in our team, if we should buy AMD datacenter GPU's because it was WAY cheaper, I mean 4-5 times cheaper. Everyone disagreed and we went with the NVDA GPU and AMD CPU, and we are just one team in a huge company. Remember when I told you I was a THIRD WORLD REGARD? Yeah. NVDA technologies are just spreading to this part of the world. Even we are spending MILLIONS of dollars for NVDA. And we are just starting to build up our NVDA datacenters. What do you think in 5 years, when it is time to upgrade, do you think that we will switch our provider and ditch all the work? Or do you think that we will go with NVDA and make them rich? Let the bears win some battles, so NVDA can win the war. EDIT: forgor some words",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,0.999,NEGATIVE

Some of you regards might say that ""OH THEIR STOCK PRICE INCREASED 150% YOY HOW IS THAT NOT OVERPRICED"", I will kindly ask you to check their income growth, which sits at 122% YOY. First of all, lets compare some other tech giants earnings to NVDA earnings to see what they are ""worth now"". Name Stock price EPS SP/EPS ratio AAPL 230 1,4 164 MSFT 413 2,95 140 AMD 145 0,16 1.035 META 516 5,16 100 AMZN 171 1,26 135 NVDA 116 0,68 170 As you can see above, they are not overpriced related to their current earnings. And I think that them going back to 110 will set them good for later improvements. But them getting hyped beyond recognition was the sole reason for them being priced at 130 per price. But before jumping into the NVDA analysis, lets go over every single tech stock in that list. AAPL Latest thing they achieved was M1 chip, converting old and worthless Macbook Pro hardware into a performing machine with great battery life. This was also accompanied by the fact that they can charge a premium for small hardware upgrades (200$ for a simple 256GB storage?), which helped them to sell new computers to their old customers and gain huge profits. How do I know this? Because after 2021, when M1 chip proved to be powerful and resourceful, most of our Macbook stack got renewed. I was using a 6 years old work Macbook before that, because newer Intel Macbooks did not promise anything new. But this was 3 years ago. Now, they are pretty much failing to create new income markets. Their latest tech demo ""Vision Pro"" failed miserably. Their only means to increase their income is to sell more hardware to push their services (AppStore and stuff), but this is also under investigation and they probably will have to open up their ecosystem more. MSFT They did suck tits before Nadella became a CEO. They tried to be a ""everything"" company but everything they did suck. Then Nadella came and transformed the rotting corpse of MSFT on the Golden Throne into the Cloud giant they are. They are platformless. Their services are used everywhere. They are bringing Windows into ARM devices (again) and it does not suck this time. New ARM platform seems to outperform M series Macbooks in battery performance, which will end years of Macbook supremacy. They are agile. They set and integrate trends easier. Game Pass? Azure? Cloud Office? AMD I am a fellow AMD user (7900XTX gang?) and oh boy they are at least a few years behind in datacenter solutions. Also given their driver problem history on Desktop, power draw problems and other bugs, they need more resources to fix their problems first. Also, sadly, they do not have CUDA. Personally, I am training some neural networks on my 7900XTX and it is 5 to 10 times faster than my CPU but also 5 to 10 times slower than NVDA counterpart. And also, I have to put in the extra work to find that specific framework that works with AMD and make the very specific adjustments before even I can start using the hardware. Even if their hardware can match NVDA, it is like having a really fast fighter jet without any software assistance, yeah you can MAYBE safely take off if you work hard enough, but you will never win against the jest with a strong software. And no one is buying their data center products (Other than their CPU's). I will get on this in NVDA's section. META They are a ""AD"" company, just like Google. They have some ""long game"" products (Metaverse and Google Self Driving as much as you joke them), but they are far from ALPHA phase. If they can show the world that this is the future, they might get a 60% to 90% increase in their value. ALSO THEY ARE BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WORTH NVDA PRODUCTS. AMZN The ""everything company"". They are big. But not as much profitable as the rest. For me, their biggest product is AWS. If they can create a new income source they will be the next 3T company, may be even earlier than GOOGL. NVDA AND OUR STAR CHILD. HOT TOPIC OF 2024. THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD. Do you remember when they wanted to acquire ARM? This was back in 2020, when their market cap was around 145 BILLION. Do you know how much they were willing to spend on ARM? 40 BILLION DOLLARS. This was before the AI craze and boom in their revenue. So why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU's of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace. Remember what I told you in AAPL's section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now? H100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell. And I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD. This was because in our company, we have bought A MILLION DOLLARS worth of NVDA datacenter products. There was a discussion in our team, if we should buy AMD datacenter GPU's because it was WAY cheaper, I mean 4-5 times cheaper. Everyone disagreed and we went with the NVDA GPU and AMD CPU, and we are just one team in a huge company. Remember when I told you I was a THIRD WORLD REGARD? Yeah. NVDA technologies are just spreading to this part of the world. Even we are spending MILLIONS of dollars for NVDA. And we are just starting to build up our NVDA datacenters. What do you think in 5 years, when it is time to upgrade, do you think that we will switch our provider and ditch all the work? Or do you think that we will go with NVDA and make them rich?

Some of you regards might say that ""OH THEIR STOCK PRICE INCREASED 150% YOY HOW IS THAT NOT OVERPRICED"", I will kindly ask you to check their income growth, which sits at 122% YOY. First of all, lets compare some other tech giants earnings to NVDA earnings to see what they are ""worth now"". Name Stock price EPS SP/EPS ratio AAPL 230 1,4 164 MSFT 413 2,95 140 AMD 145 0,16 1.035 META 516 5,16 100 AMZN 171 1,26 135 NVDA 116 0,68 170 As you can see above, they are not overpriced related to their current earnings. And I think that them going back to 110 will set them good for later improvements. But them getting hyped beyond recognition was the sole reason for them being priced at 130 per price. But before jumping into the NVDA analysis, lets go over every single tech stock in that list. AAPL Latest thing they achieved was M1 chip, converting old and worthless Macbook Pro hardware into a performing machine with great battery life. This was also accompanied by the fact that they can charge a premium for small hardware upgrades (200$ for a simple 256GB storage?), which helped them to sell new computers to their old customers and gain huge profits. How do I know this? Because after 2021, when M1 chip proved to be powerful and resourceful, most of our Macbook stack got renewed. I was using a 6 years old work Macbook before that, because newer Intel Macbooks did not promise anything new. But this was 3 years ago. Now, they are pretty much failing to create new income markets. Their latest tech demo ""Vision Pro"" failed miserably. Their only means to increase their income is to sell more hardware to push their services (AppStore and stuff), but this is also under investigation and they probably will have to open up their ecosystem more. MSFT They did suck tits before Nadella became a CEO. They tried to be a ""everything"" company but everything they did suck. Then Nadella came and transformed the rotting corpse of MSFT on the Golden Throne into the Cloud giant they are. They are platformless. Their services are used everywhere. They are bringing Windows into ARM devices (again) and it does not suck this time. New ARM platform seems to outperform M series Macbooks in battery performance, which will end years of Macbook supremacy. They are agile. They set and integrate trends easier. Game Pass? Azure? Cloud Office? AMD I am a fellow AMD user (7900XTX gang?) and oh boy they are at least a few years behind in datacenter solutions. Also given their driver problem history on Desktop, power draw problems and other bugs, they need more resources to fix their problems first. Also, sadly, they do not have CUDA. Personally, I am training some neural networks on my 7900XTX and it is 5 to 10 times faster than my CPU but also 5 to 10 times slower than NVDA counterpart. And also, I have to put in the extra work to find that specific framework that works with AMD and make the very specific adjustments before even I can start using the hardware. Even if their hardware can match NVDA, it is like having a really fast fighter jet without any software assistance, yeah you can MAYBE safely take off if you work hard enough, but you will never win against the jest with a strong software. And no one is buying their data center products (Other than their CPU's). I will get on this in NVDA's section. META They are a ""AD"" company, just like Google. They have some ""long game"" products (Metaverse and Google Self Driving as much as you joke them), but they are far from ALPHA phase. If they can show the world that this is the future, they might get a 60% to 90% increase in their value. ALSO THEY ARE BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WORTH NVDA PRODUCTS. AMZN The ""everything company"". They are big. But not as much profitable as the rest. For me, their biggest product is AWS. If they can create a new income source they will be the next 3T company, may be even earlier than GOOGL. NVDA AND OUR STAR CHILD. HOT TOPIC OF 2024. THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD. Do you remember when they wanted to acquire ARM? This was back in 2020, when their market cap was around 145 BILLION. Do you know how much they were willing to spend on ARM? 40 BILLION DOLLARS. This was before the AI craze and boom in their revenue. So why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU's of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace. Remember what I told you in AAPL's section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now? H100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell. And I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD. This was because in our company, we have bought A MILLION DOLLARS worth of NVDA datacenter products. There was a discussion in our team, if we should buy AMD datacenter GPU's because it was WAY cheaper, I mean 4-5 times cheaper. Everyone disagreed and we went with the NVDA GPU and AMD CPU, and we are just one team in a huge company. Remember when I told you I was a THIRD WORLD REGARD? Yeah. NVDA technologies are just spreading to this part of the world. Even we are spending MILLIONS of dollars for NVDA. And we are just starting to build up our NVDA datacenters. What do you think in 5 years, when it is time to upgrade, do you think that we will switch our provider and ditch all the work? Or do you think that we will go with NVDA and make them rich?

First of all, lets compare some other tech giants earnings to NVDA earnings to see what they are ""worth now"". Name Stock price EPS SP/EPS ratio AAPL 230 1,4 164 MSFT 413 2,95 140 AMD 145 0,16 1.035 META 516 5,16 100 AMZN 171 1,26 135 NVDA 116 0,68 170 As you can see above, they are not overpriced related to their current earnings. And I think that them going back to 110 will set them good for later improvements. But them getting hyped beyond recognition was the sole reason for them being priced at 130 per price. But before jumping into the NVDA analysis, lets go over every single tech stock in that list. AAPL Latest thing they achieved was M1 chip, converting old and worthless Macbook Pro hardware into a performing machine with great battery life. This was also accompanied by the fact that they can charge a premium for small hardware upgrades (200$ for a simple 256GB storage?), which helped them to sell new computers to their old customers and gain huge profits. How do I know this? Because after 2021, when M1 chip proved to be powerful and resourceful, most of our Macbook stack got renewed. I was using a 6 years old work Macbook before that, because newer Intel Macbooks did not promise anything new. But this was 3 years ago. Now, they are pretty much failing to create new income markets. Their latest tech demo ""Vision Pro"" failed miserably. Their only means to increase their income is to sell more hardware to push their services (AppStore and stuff), but this is also under investigation and they probably will have to open up their ecosystem more. MSFT They did suck tits before Nadella became a CEO. They tried to be a ""everything"" company but everything they did suck. Then Nadella came and transformed the rotting corpse of MSFT on the Golden Throne into the Cloud giant they are. They are platformless. Their services are used everywhere. They are bringing Windows into ARM devices (again) and it does not suck this time. New ARM platform seems to outperform M series Macbooks in battery performance, which will end years of Macbook supremacy. They are agile. They set and integrate trends easier. Game Pass? Azure? Cloud Office? AMD I am a fellow AMD user (7900XTX gang?) and oh boy they are at least a few years behind in datacenter solutions. Also given their driver problem history on Desktop, power draw problems and other bugs, they need more resources to fix their problems first. Also, sadly, they do not have CUDA. Personally, I am training some neural networks on my 7900XTX and it is 5 to 10 times faster than my CPU but also 5 to 10 times slower than NVDA counterpart. And also, I have to put in the extra work to find that specific framework that works with AMD and make the very specific adjustments before even I can start using the hardware. Even if their hardware can match NVDA, it is like having a really fast fighter jet without any software assistance, yeah you can MAYBE safely take off if you work hard enough, but you will never win against the jest with a strong software. And no one is buying their data center products (Other than their CPU's). I will get on this in NVDA's section. META They are a ""AD"" company, just like Google. They have some ""long game"" products (Metaverse and Google Self Driving as much as you joke them), but they are far from ALPHA phase. If they can show the world that this is the future, they might get a 60% to 90% increase in their value. ALSO THEY ARE BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WORTH NVDA PRODUCTS. AMZN The ""everything company"". They are big. But not as much profitable as the rest. For me, their biggest product is AWS. If they can create a new income source they will be the next 3T company, may be even earlier than GOOGL. NVDA AND OUR STAR CHILD. HOT TOPIC OF 2024. THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD. Do you remember when they wanted to acquire ARM? This was back in 2020, when their market cap was around 145 BILLION. Do you know how much they were willing to spend on ARM? 40 BILLION DOLLARS. This was before the AI craze and boom in their revenue. So why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU's of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace. Remember what I told you in AAPL's section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now? H100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell. And I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD. This was because in our company, we have bought A MILLION DOLLARS worth of NVDA datacenter products. There was a discussion in our team, if we should buy AMD datacenter GPU's because it was WAY cheaper, I mean 4-5 times cheaper. Everyone disagreed and we went with the NVDA GPU and AMD CPU, and we are just one team in a huge company. Remember when I told you I was a THIRD WORLD REGARD? Yeah. NVDA technologies are just spreading to this part of the world. Even we are spending MILLIONS of dollars for NVDA. And we are just starting to build up our NVDA datacenters. What do you think in 5 years, when it is time to upgrade, do you think that we will switch our provider and ditch all the work? Or do you think that we will go with NVDA and make them rich? Let the bears win some battles, so NVDA can win the war. EDIT: forgor some words",heres why nvidia will hit 40T by 2025 rape comment and subscribe,1,0.525,1.0,NEGATIVE

EDIT: forgor some words","NVDA is reliant on the companies you’re listing spending more and more on their products.NVDA cannot grow revenues unless the others grow revenues.Until the big boys spend more on NVDA than they do on buybacks (and they won’t, they’ll protect their share price), it’s a non starter.As it sits you’re looking at 20 years if they keep growing their income by $10B a year (current YoY net income increase) to break even on a $3T evaluation.It’s not feasible, because we know the CapEx of their buyers aren’t growing that fast. All those companies told you what they’ll spend in the next 12 months, and none of them spend even 50% of their CapEx with NVDA. For the record, even if they all spent 100% of their CapEx with NVDA you still don’t gain $10B YoY…That said, you may very well see $5, $10, fuck it $100T market cap. There is no limit as to how high the market cap can go.You’ll just never see a return on the investment at those levels outside of selling to the next NVDArd.",0,0.55,1.0,NEGATIVE

NVDA technologies are just spreading to this part of the world. Even we are spending MILLIONS of dollars for NVDA. And we are just starting to build up our NVDA datacenters. What do you think in 5 years, when it is time to upgrade, do you think that we will switch our provider and ditch all the work? Or do you think that we will go with NVDA and make them rich?

I am a 3rd world country regard who is a Software Engineer and I will share my insights into the industry with my broken ass English, if you want to join me on this journey, be my guest. The problem with NVDA is that they are ""overhyped"" not ""overpriced"". Some of you regards might say that ""OH THEIR STOCK PRICE INCREASED 150% YOY HOW IS THAT NOT OVERPRICED"", I will kindly ask you to check their income growth, which sits at 122% YOY. First of all, lets compare some other tech giants earnings to NVDA earnings to see what they are ""worth now"".

And I think that them going back to 110 will set them good for later improvements. But them getting hyped beyond recognition was the sole reason for them being priced at 130 per price. But before jumping into the NVDA analysis, lets go over every single tech stock in that list. AAPL Latest thing they achieved was M1 chip, converting old and worthless Macbook Pro hardware into a performing machine with great battery life. This was also accompanied by the fact that they can charge a premium for small hardware upgrades (200$ for a simple 256GB storage?), which helped them to sell new computers to their old customers and gain huge profits. How do I know this? Because after 2021, when M1 chip proved to be powerful and resourceful, most of our Macbook stack got renewed. I was using a 6 years old work Macbook before that, because newer Intel Macbooks did not promise anything new. But this was 3 years ago. Now, they are pretty much failing to create new income markets. Their latest tech demo ""Vision Pro"" failed miserably. Their only means to increase their income is to sell more hardware to push their services (AppStore and stuff), but this is also under investigation and they probably will have to open up their ecosystem more. MSFT They did suck tits before Nadella became a CEO. They tried to be a ""everything"" company but everything they did suck. Then Nadella came and transformed the rotting corpse of MSFT on the Golden Throne into the Cloud giant they are. They are platformless. Their services are used everywhere. They are bringing Windows into ARM devices (again) and it does not suck this time. New ARM platform seems to outperform M series Macbooks in battery performance, which will end years of Macbook supremacy. They are agile. They set and integrate trends easier. Game Pass? Azure? Cloud Office? AMD I am a fellow AMD user (7900XTX gang?) and oh boy they are at least a few years behind in datacenter solutions. Also given their driver problem history on Desktop, power draw problems and other bugs, they need more resources to fix their problems first. Also, sadly, they do not have CUDA. Personally, I am training some neural networks on my 7900XTX and it is 5 to 10 times faster than my CPU but also 5 to 10 times slower than NVDA counterpart. And also, I have to put in the extra work to find that specific framework that works with AMD and make the very specific adjustments before even I can start using the hardware. Even if their hardware can match NVDA, it is like having a really fast fighter jet without any software assistance, yeah you can MAYBE safely take off if you work hard enough, but you will never win against the jest with a strong software. And no one is buying their data center products (Other than their CPU's). I will get on this in NVDA's section. META They are a ""AD"" company, just like Google. They have some ""long game"" products (Metaverse and Google Self Driving as much as you joke them), but they are far from ALPHA phase. If they can show the world that this is the future, they might get a 60% to 90% increase in their value. ALSO THEY ARE BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WORTH NVDA PRODUCTS. AMZN The ""everything company"". They are big. But not as much profitable as the rest. For me, their biggest product is AWS. If they can create a new income source they will be the next 3T company, may be even earlier than GOOGL. NVDA AND OUR STAR CHILD. HOT TOPIC OF 2024. THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD. Do you remember when they wanted to acquire ARM? This was back in 2020, when their market cap was around 145 BILLION. Do you know how much they were willing to spend on ARM? 40 BILLION DOLLARS. This was before the AI craze and boom in their revenue. So why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU's of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace. Remember what I told you in AAPL's section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now? H100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell. And I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD.

,"Hi regards, This is not a ""copium"" post about the recent stock price drops. I am a 3rd world country regard who is a Software Engineer and I will share my insights into the industry with my broken ass English, if you want to join me on this journey, be my guest. The problem with NVDA is that they are ""overhyped"" not ""overpriced"". Some of you regards might say that ""OH THEIR STOCK PRICE INCREASED 150% YOY HOW IS THAT NOT OVERPRICED"", I will kindly ask you to check their income growth, which sits at 122% YOY. First of all, lets compare some other tech giants earnings to NVDA earnings to see what they are ""worth now"". Name Stock price EPS SP/EPS ratio AAPL 230 1,4 164 MSFT 413 2,95 140 AMD 145 0,16 1.035 META 516 5,16 100 AMZN 171 1,26 135 NVDA 116 0,68 170 As you can see above, they are not overpriced related to their current earnings. And I think that them going back to 110 will set them good for later improvements. But them getting hyped beyond recognition was the sole reason for them being priced at 130 per price. But before jumping into the NVDA analysis, lets go over every single tech stock in that list. AAPL Latest thing they achieved was M1 chip, converting old and worthless Macbook Pro hardware into a performing machine with great battery life. This was also accompanied by the fact that they can charge a premium for small hardware upgrades (200$ for a simple 256GB storage?), which helped them to sell new computers to their old customers and gain huge profits. How do I know this? Because after 2021, when M1 chip proved to be powerful and resourceful, most of our Macbook stack got renewed. I was using a 6 years old work Macbook before that, because newer Intel Macbooks did not promise anything new. But this was 3 years ago. Now, they are pretty much failing to create new income markets. Their latest tech demo ""Vision Pro"" failed miserably. Their only means to increase their income is to sell more hardware to push their services (AppStore and stuff), but this is also under investigation and they probably will have to open up their ecosystem more. MSFT They did suck tits before Nadella became a CEO. They tried to be a ""everything"" company but everything they did suck. Then Nadella came and transformed the rotting corpse of MSFT on the Golden Throne into the Cloud giant they are. They are platformless. Their services are used everywhere. They are bringing Windows into ARM devices (again) and it does not suck this time. New ARM platform seems to outperform M series Macbooks in battery performance, which will end years of Macbook supremacy. They are agile. They set and integrate trends easier. Game Pass? Azure? Cloud Office? AMD I am a fellow AMD user (7900XTX gang?) and oh boy they are at least a few years behind in datacenter solutions. Also given their driver problem history on Desktop, power draw problems and other bugs, they need more resources to fix their problems first. Also, sadly, they do not have CUDA. Personally, I am training some neural networks on my 7900XTX and it is 5 to 10 times faster than my CPU but also 5 to 10 times slower than NVDA counterpart. And also, I have to put in the extra work to find that specific framework that works with AMD and make the very specific adjustments before even I can start using the hardware. Even if their hardware can match NVDA, it is like having a really fast fighter jet without any software assistance, yeah you can MAYBE safely take off if you work hard enough, but you will never win against the jest with a strong software. And no one is buying their data center products (Other than their CPU's). I will get on this in NVDA's section. META They are a ""AD"" company, just like Google. They have some ""long game"" products (Metaverse and Google Self Driving as much as you joke them), but they are far from ALPHA phase. If they can show the world that this is the future, they might get a 60% to 90% increase in their value. ALSO THEY ARE BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WORTH NVDA PRODUCTS. AMZN The ""everything company"". They are big. But not as much profitable as the rest. For me, their biggest product is AWS. If they can create a new income source they will be the next 3T company, may be even earlier than GOOGL. NVDA AND OUR STAR CHILD. HOT TOPIC OF 2024. THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD. Do you remember when they wanted to acquire ARM? This was back in 2020, when their market cap was around 145 BILLION. Do you know how much they were willing to spend on ARM? 40 BILLION DOLLARS. This was before the AI craze and boom in their revenue. So why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU's of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace. Remember what I told you in AAPL's section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now? H100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell. And I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD.

NVDA technologies are just spreading to this part of the world. Even we are spending MILLIONS of dollars for NVDA. And we are just starting to build up our NVDA datacenters. What do you think in 5 years, when it is time to upgrade, do you think that we will switch our provider and ditch all the work? Or do you think that we will go with NVDA and make them rich? Let the bears win some battles, so NVDA can win the war. EDIT: forgor some words","Nvidia is doing well now and in the near future because of a combination of vision, business savviness and some luck. They helped build the market for AI chips. Buuuut, now that the market is established, all of big-tech is waking up and massively ramping up efforts to build their own AI chips. I think the situation is, and will be, similar to Tesla - all car companies are making EVs now, there is no overwhelming reason to buy a Tesla now if you want an EV. What all of this means is that Nvidia's current income levels are probably just for 5ish years and their revenue is going to peak soon. This completely does not justify a 5 or 10 T market cap. Also, there is massive strategic interest from many rich countries not to depend too heavily on a Taiwanese country because of the threat of China. So no, a 5 or 10T market cap makes no sense at all.",0,0.552,0.996,NEGATIVE
,"Hi regards, This is not a ""copium"" post about the recent stock price drops. I am a 3rd world country regard who is a Software Engineer and I will share my insights into the industry with my broken ass English, if you want to join me on this journey, be my guest. The problem with NVDA is that they are ""overhyped"" not ""overpriced"". Some of you regards might say that ""OH THEIR STOCK PRICE INCREASED 150% YOY HOW IS THAT NOT OVERPRICED"", I will kindly ask you to check their income growth, which sits at 122% YOY. First of all, lets compare some other tech giants earnings to NVDA earnings to see what they are ""worth now"". Name Stock price EPS SP/EPS ratio AAPL 230 1,4 164 MSFT 413 2,95 140 AMD 145 0,16 1.035 META 516 5,16 100 AMZN 171 1,26 135 NVDA 116 0,68 170 As you can see above, they are not overpriced related to their current earnings. And I think that them going back to 110 will set them good for later improvements. But them getting hyped beyond recognition was the sole reason for them being priced at 130 per price. But before jumping into the NVDA analysis, lets go over every single tech stock in that list. AAPL Latest thing they achieved was M1 chip, converting old and worthless Macbook Pro hardware into a performing machine with great battery life. This was also accompanied by the fact that they can charge a premium for small hardware upgrades (200$ for a simple 256GB storage?), which helped them to sell new computers to their old customers and gain huge profits. How do I know this? Because after 2021, when M1 chip proved to be powerful and resourceful, most of our Macbook stack got renewed. I was using a 6 years old work Macbook before that, because newer Intel Macbooks did not promise anything new. But this was 3 years ago. Now, they are pretty much failing to create new income markets. Their latest tech demo ""Vision Pro"" failed miserably. Their only means to increase their income is to sell more hardware to push their services (AppStore and stuff), but this is also under investigation and they probably will have to open up their ecosystem more. MSFT They did suck tits before Nadella became a CEO. They tried to be a ""everything"" company but everything they did suck. Then Nadella came and transformed the rotting corpse of MSFT on the Golden Throne into the Cloud giant they are. They are platformless. Their services are used everywhere. They are bringing Windows into ARM devices (again) and it does not suck this time. New ARM platform seems to outperform M series Macbooks in battery performance, which will end years of Macbook supremacy. They are agile. They set and integrate trends easier. Game Pass? Azure? Cloud Office? AMD I am a fellow AMD user (7900XTX gang?) and oh boy they are at least a few years behind in datacenter solutions. Also given their driver problem history on Desktop, power draw problems and other bugs, they need more resources to fix their problems first. Also, sadly, they do not have CUDA. Personally, I am training some neural networks on my 7900XTX and it is 5 to 10 times faster than my CPU but also 5 to 10 times slower than NVDA counterpart. And also, I have to put in the extra work to find that specific framework that works with AMD and make the very specific adjustments before even I can start using the hardware. Even if their hardware can match NVDA, it is like having a really fast fighter jet without any software assistance, yeah you can MAYBE safely take off if you work hard enough, but you will never win against the jest with a strong software. And no one is buying their data center products (Other than their CPU's). I will get on this in NVDA's section. META They are a ""AD"" company, just like Google. They have some ""long game"" products (Metaverse and Google Self Driving as much as you joke them), but they are far from ALPHA phase. If they can show the world that this is the future, they might get a 60% to 90% increase in their value. ALSO THEY ARE BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WORTH NVDA PRODUCTS. AMZN The ""everything company"". They are big. But not as much profitable as the rest. For me, their biggest product is AWS. If they can create a new income source they will be the next 3T company, may be even earlier than GOOGL. NVDA AND OUR STAR CHILD. HOT TOPIC OF 2024. THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD. Do you remember when they wanted to acquire ARM? This was back in 2020, when their market cap was around 145 BILLION. Do you know how much they were willing to spend on ARM? 40 BILLION DOLLARS. This was before the AI craze and boom in their revenue. So why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU's of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace. Remember what I told you in AAPL's section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now? H100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell. And I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD. This was because in our company, we have bought A MILLION DOLLARS worth of NVDA datacenter products. There was a discussion in our team, if we should buy AMD datacenter GPU's because it was WAY cheaper, I mean 4-5 times cheaper. Everyone disagreed and we went with the NVDA GPU and AMD CPU, and we are just one team in a huge company. Remember when I told you I was a THIRD WORLD REGARD? Yeah.

Do you remember when they wanted to acquire ARM? This was back in 2020, when their market cap was around 145 BILLION. Do you know how much they were willing to spend on ARM? 40 BILLION DOLLARS. This was before the AI craze and boom in their revenue. So why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU's of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace. Remember what I told you in AAPL's section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now? H100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell. And I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD. This was because in our company, we have bought A MILLION DOLLARS worth of NVDA datacenter products. There was a discussion in our team, if we should buy AMD datacenter GPU's because it was WAY cheaper, I mean 4-5 times cheaper. Everyone disagreed and we went with the NVDA GPU and AMD CPU, and we are just one team in a huge company. Remember when I told you I was a THIRD WORLD REGARD? Yeah. NVDA technologies are just spreading to this part of the world. Even we are spending MILLIONS of dollars for NVDA. And we are just starting to build up our NVDA datacenters. What do you think in 5 years, when it is time to upgrade, do you think that we will switch our provider and ditch all the work? Or do you think that we will go with NVDA and make them rich? Let the bears win some battles, so NVDA can win the war. EDIT: forgor some words","Like if they keep printing/pressing enter for money to the system, 5T is low. It will be 50T. Maybe even more and a beer will cost you 50$.",0,0.52,1.0,NEGATIVE
