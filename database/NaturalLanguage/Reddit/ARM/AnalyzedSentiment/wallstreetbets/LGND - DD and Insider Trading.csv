,"Hi everyone, I'm back after my last DD which went..... okay. BYON stock swung like I expected, but not entirely to the levels I expected. This time, I've come armed with more information on a different stock: LGND. I went through their insider buys and sells and found some really interesting patterns. Now these are only open market buys. This means they weren't scheduled or part of an RSU. Check out this chart below: (blue arrow is the most recent buy) Some damn good timing. Now it's not perfect, but we can't expect it to be. Also remember that insiders only buy for one reason, they think the stock price is going to go up. The sells are not as informative, but I have to say that some of these are just extremely well timed. It's got a relatively high P/E, so I can only think that the market is factoring in some high upcoming revenue, or it's overvalued. More guidance on company: https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ligand-lgnd-posts-long-term-outlook-updates-portfolio-progress - little outdated but good My positions: Long on shares only. Soft stop loss at -15%. Will cut down on my positions if I see a nice bump. Happy to answer more questions about this.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,0.999,NEGATIVE
