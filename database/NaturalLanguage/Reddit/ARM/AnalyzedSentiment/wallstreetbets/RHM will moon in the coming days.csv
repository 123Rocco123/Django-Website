,"Let me try to explain the situation to you regards as simply as possible: German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall lost 7% last week after a Bloomberg article about possible peace talks amidst Western allies. (btw Putin has already stated that Russia will not take part in these negotiations) The market is waiting for a sign as to whether the West will continue to provide money for future arms deliveries. Zelenskyy is presenting his “Victory Plan” to the UN today and will talk to Biden tomorrow. So we are going to get a new point of reference in the next few days. So far Ukraine's allies have taken the position of supplying the country with enough weapons to prevent a defeat. However, they are not supplying enough for a victory either. (basic american strategy: defeat the conventional russian armed forces with as few (american) losses as possible. also don't escalate into WW3 lol) The worry now is that the West will give up and force Ukraine into a ceasefire... That's not gonna happen. America wants to slowly bleed Russia dry and has successfully implemented this strategy over the last two years. Nothing will change, because letting Russia win would only lead to bigger problems and show countries like China that you can get away with pretty much anything in the long run. Besides, Russia is facing more and more economic and personnel problems. So an end to the war in which Russia “loses” is also in sight. I'm sure that Zelenskyy will get new concessions on arms deliveries and aid packages in the coming days and worried investors will be reassured. Rheinmetall is set for the next few years even without further orders for Ukraine. And the upcoming war between Israel and Hezbollah is not yet priced in either. Germany is a close ally of Israel and may also supply weapons.

So far Ukraine's allies have taken the position of supplying the country with enough weapons to prevent a defeat. However, they are not supplying enough for a victory either. (basic american strategy: defeat the conventional russian armed forces with as few (american) losses as possible. also don't escalate into WW3 lol) The worry now is that the West will give up and force Ukraine into a ceasefire... That's not gonna happen. America wants to slowly bleed Russia dry and has successfully implemented this strategy over the last two years. Nothing will change, because letting Russia win would only lead to bigger problems and show countries like China that you can get away with pretty much anything in the long run. Besides, Russia is facing more and more economic and personnel problems. So an end to the war in which Russia “loses” is also in sight. I'm sure that Zelenskyy will get new concessions on arms deliveries and aid packages in the coming days and worried investors will be reassured. Rheinmetall is set for the next few years even without further orders for Ukraine. And the upcoming war between Israel and Hezbollah is not yet priced in either. Germany is a close ally of Israel and may also supply weapons.
