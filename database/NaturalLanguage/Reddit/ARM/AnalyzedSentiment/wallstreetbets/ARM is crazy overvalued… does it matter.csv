,"I have ARM in one of my watchlists, and I see it often. Lately, I have only seen green. In fact, the stock is up almost exactly 100% since its low of $87 on April 19. However, it took me about 5 minutes to realize just how overvalued the company is. First of all, it is currently sitting at a market cap of 182 billion dollars. When you look closer, you will see that the company had normalized net income of $395 million dollars in 2023. You read that right. 395 million. Total 2023 revenue was just 2.6 billion. It has a P/E of 600+. These are shocking numbers for a company with that high of a market cap. ARM is riding on the AI wave, obviously. Nvidia is on a meteoric rise, and any company that mentions AI sees their stock prices skyrocket. However, ARM’s entire business model is royalties. They created the ARM computer chip architecture in 1985, which is far more efficient than Intel’s x86. ARM architecture is used in almost every mobile device, and lately, many computer chips in laptops and desktops (All of Apple’s chips use ARM). This all sounds great for ARM, until you realize that they don’t design these chips, nor do they build them. They are simply benefitting from the recent AI hype. Don’t be fooled however… with the way the market is behaving, this stock could run up much further than any of us expect. I wanted to insult some of the analysts that are continuing to recommend buys and increasing PO’s, but they probably know it will continue to rise despite these fundamentals. Or they are pumping it up on purpose. Because of how crazy this is, I’m staying on the sidelines. (I actually am just too poor to lose more money). Proceed with caution into any plays on this company. And remember that the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,0.999,NEGATIVE

Some of the ARM designs are slightly more efficient at low power because they sacrifice performance, and a lot of them have marginally better idle power draw, but for all intents and purpose it’s not more efficient.The only reason that’s a meme that exists is that Apple came out with chips on the desktop that were 2+ nodes ahead of Intel at the time, and Intel was the only thing they’d ever compare themselves to. Like, sure you’re twice as fast while using less power, but you’re also comparing yourself to 6 year old chips, not to mention the cherry picking.Now you have the CEO feeding people dogshit about how “only ARM can do AI” and “ARM will be over 50% client market on 5 years.” It’s all horseshit from a technical perspective, and sooner or later the numbers they promise won’t come about.
