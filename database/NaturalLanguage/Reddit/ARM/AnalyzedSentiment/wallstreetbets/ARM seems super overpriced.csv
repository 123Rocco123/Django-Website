,"Hello fellow regards, I have never posted on here before but I wanted to bring the topic of ARM up. They have a P/E Ratio of 1.3k and have earnings coming up on the 8th After close and just wanted to get your opinion’s on it. I know it gets pumped alot for no reason and I know they have a super secure buisness model but I just don’t see them ever reaching this price and it being worth it at the moment. Do you guys expect a drop when they report earnings or do you think it will just be green because they will most likely beat earnings. This market is so wack. Thanks for your time.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,0.999,NEGATIVE

I will refrain from using the M word as that was settled in court. Now they have their share, and the IP becomes increasingly complex and powerful, they jack up their rates. They benefit from all “tech” growth across mobile, automotive, etc and now cloud and infrastructure as well. It’s a recent IPO with a lot of hype but it’s no startup",1,0.544,0.999,POSITIVE

I think TSM had positive earnings and guidance if not mistaken but still went down. QCOM was the only one up today but don’t know the details.
