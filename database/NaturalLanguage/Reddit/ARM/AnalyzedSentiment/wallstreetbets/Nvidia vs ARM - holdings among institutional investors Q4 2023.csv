,,"Looks more like a brain neural activity of a NVDA holder vs ARM holder. I might be wrong, I donâ€™t understand half the words Iâ€™m saying. ARM to the moon! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€",0,0.498,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,I can barely read a 2d chart written in crayon and you expect me to be able to read 4d matrix shit?,0,0.508,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"So does this mean ARM is more retail investment than it is institutional (they've already gotten out of it, retail is bagholding) or does this just represent the fact that ARM has way less stock available?",0,0.544,0.999,NEGATIVE
,,"According to some studies, only 20% of investors are retail. In case of ARM, 90% is hold by Softbank.",1,0.529,0.997,NEGATIVE
,,"Doesn't Softbank's lockup end on March 12th? Which at current valuation, would likely sell? (they tried to sell their holdings to NVDA for $40b in 2022 and were blocked by regulators).",2,0.512,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"""Since the lockup is still in effect, only about 9.5% of ARM's total outstanding shares are being traded. The remaining 90.5% become eligible to be traded once the lockup expires on March 12. Investment firm SoftBank (SFTB.Y) owns most of the locked-up shares, and the stock's strong momentum could incentivize SoftBank and others to start selling to realize their gains"".",3,0.525,0.998,NEGATIVE
,,Retail bag holding March 13 the stock lock up over and soft bank got 90% of that companies stock to pay with and we work hurt them a lot arm bought them back with more to give,1,0.562,0.999,NEGATIVE
,,This is the most regarded comment that I've read today on WSB. Softbank isn't going to just unload 90% of the float on the open market when the unlock happens. They will spread it out like 1% a month.,2,0.531,0.769,NEGATIVE
,,Lmfaoo I know that but I can see that price dropping back to pre ai hype rally prices arm is not worth $140,3,0.544,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,The stock is super low float that why it has such wild price swings. Unloading even 1% a month right now will be enough selling pressure to crash itâ€¦ not to mention everyoneâ€™s expectation that selling starts in March.,3,0.527,0.999,NEGATIVE
,,Perhaps. Perhaps not. If other institutional investors are waiting for Softbank to unload so they can pick up shares... the selling pressure could be met with an equal amount of buy pressure. It's in Softbank's best interest to do anything they can to not tank the price of the stock. My guess is they won't be selling unless there is significant buy-side interest to support the sales,4,0.56,1.0,NEGATIVE

,,It's a good thing if the company has been public for a long time. Not with ARM because that 90% is owned by SoftBank. There is good chance that they will dump their shares and leave dump retail holding the bag.,1,0.571,1.0,NEGATIVE

,,So it shows that Nvidia shares are more evenly distributed than arm chairs. That indicates more players and a stronger back hold against share price dropping. Because if I already have a price target for Nvidia and it drops I might buy more? The last part might just be wishful thinking of a bag holder.,2,0.54,0.872,NEGATIVE
,,"Correct, you can use it as a tool to see how many institutional investors are involved. This is interesting if you search for some small-cap / mid cap stocks to see ownership distribution.ARM is not the best example because - as already many redditors pointed out - is hold 90% by Softbank but that is currently not reflected in the SEC filings. Will be interesting to see how the share distributions evolve with the next quarterly updates full available mid of May.",3,0.523,0.916,POSITIVE
