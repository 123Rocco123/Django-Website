XOM has been hovering around $100 for quite some time, and will be a major winner soon. Think about 2022, Tech sold off and Energy stocks were crazy. 2023, Tech was crazy and Energy stocks were lackluster and sold off. Last years losers are this years winners. Feel like rotation is coming and oil about to start a run -- XOM has a lot of room.",2,0.525,0.999,NEGATIVE
