,,"Anyone that knows about this knows Intel is fucked. Hedged their future on high-NA EUV, making something like 200 billion in capital investments over the next 10 years while simultaneously trying to separate from their largest profit center China. Ohh and they have yet to secure any whales to keep their foundries full, themselves even opting for TSMC for i9, i7 and i3 production. And did I mention the bottleneck of talent, higher wage requirements and China’s ability to flood the market with excess DUV capacity? China has some ground to make up for, absolutely, but you’d be wrong to count them out. You should be more worried about Intel staying in business considering their 5N4Ys is turning into 2N5Y with 18A being on par with TSMCs refresh of their last generation. All this is really doing is proving to the West how essential Taiwan is and how fucked they would be if the chips stop flowing.",1,0.527,1.0,NEGATIVE

,,"not really. iirc, 1 is stalled due to pipefitters insisting they build better fabs than tsmc, who's actually built the best fabs... and the other is postponed 'indefinitely' (and seemingly, the usa's loss is japan's gain)it doesn't help that the us govt has fucked them over, both with the aforementioned union bs and publicly calling intel ""the national champion"" and presumably dumping far more money at intel's sorry fabs.plus, it never made much sense, given the silicon shield and how this would basically erode it.",3,0.514,1.0,NEGATIVE
