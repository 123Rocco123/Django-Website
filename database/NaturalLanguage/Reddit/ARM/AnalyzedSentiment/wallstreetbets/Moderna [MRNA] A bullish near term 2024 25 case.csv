[Note: Bancel isn’t shy about promoting Moderna!!!].","u/DemisHassabisFan It's a difficult balance, like yourself I'm interested in what the drug actually does, however fundamentally I'm investing to make money & ideally have a more comfortable retirement.I love their VZV/Shingles product, here's a bit more detail about itThe VZV trial had a phase 1/2 trial with 500 candidates, which is way more candidates than required for a regular phase 1 trial because with positive results Moderna can then rapidly move it into phase 3 (Moderna does this a lot as it has confidence in it's mRNA ""coding""; More info provided below). In this case, Moderna was coding for the same antigen that's in Shingrix (a bit of a cheat!), which is an FDA approved drug with a seriously impressive 90% efficacy!!OK, so why the heck would Moderna want to go head to head with a product with 90% efficacy & such a respected brand?......... Bancel in a 31May24 Bernstein Webcast answered that very question at48.45 ""I want to know is it non inferior to Shingrix or not? Because if it is not, we are done. If it is, we’re going to a Phase III because I think even if we get only 20% or 40% market share gain against Shingrix, it is going to be a $6bn to $10bn franchise. I don’t need to invest $1 of CapEx at a 95% incremental gross margin of a product that can [be made] off-season, but it’s not seasonal product. I can [make it] in Q1, when I don’t do COVID & flu and so on —indiscernible — of CapEx, 90% gross margin on $2bn, you can do the math easily. For $400m Phase III cost, it’s a very good ROI. And so that’s the type of investment we’re doing a lot right now. The good news about those Phase III is we only do them once."" [i.e. they like non-seasonal drugs such as VZV because they can produce it at any time their manufacturing plants have capacity (i.e. outside seasonal peak Flu, Covid, RSV etc), rather than leaving them mothballed.

[Note: Bancel isn’t shy about promoting Moderna!!!].","u/jourdenaYou could well be correct in that it's currently overvalued! I'm certainly choosing to invest at a risky time, as the company transitions from being a one-trick pony (i.e. just covid) to a financially stable, biotech platform company.One of the earliest things I read when researching Moderna was that Bancel told early investors ""it's going to be a growth platform or go bankrupt. The notion that this would be a 1 or 2 drug company makes zero scientific sense. It would be zero or a lot."" Given that 2 drugs have already been approved with a further 2 in the pipeline, I'm extremely confident in Moderna's future.Personally, what sets Moderna apart from many pharma companies is that it's a genuine platform company. They've proven the platform works (e.g. the way you design it / get it in the body / it has drug like properties / manufacture it etc), which reduces the ""technical risk"", leaving it with the ""biology risk"" (which traditional pharma also faces; e.g. some rare genetic disease have low biology risk as they’re well understood, however some diseases like HIV & cancer are very high biology risk).It took me a while to fully understand this concept. Essentially, the central insight is that in Moderna’s case success in one thing (CV19), makes success in other related areas (i.e. within each related modality; The modalities being Respiratory, latent diseases, rare disease etc) much more likely..... with their platform, “success begets success.” Bancel sums this up as “Predictable, Replicable Drugs, In Abundance”!!.... THIS IS THE POWER OF A PLATFORM, it's the principal reason I invested.All in all, for me, when considering whether or not Moderna is overvalued has more to do with your investment time frame than anything else. Frankly, I've honestly no idea if it's overvalued today/this week/next month, however I'm very confident that it's cheap from a long term investment perspective.... Time is my friend!This ship ain't for sinking! All the best with your own investments. BB",1,0.542,0.786,POSITIVE

Moderna has previously said ""we don’t anticipate advancing into further studies in the absence of further outside funding."" However, you have to wonder given the continuing spread of this disease & its economic impact if they were perhaps just giving potential funders time to prepare a package in the event that these results are strong? · Moderna's VZV (Herpes/Shingles; mRNA1468; TAM c.$5-6bn) phase 1/2 trial ends in Jul24, with a 27Mar24 press release saying ""We listed comparable or higher CD4 & CD8 T cell responses as compared to Shingrix."" Additional (durability) results are expected in the next few months, with the product advancing towards a pivotal Phase 3 trial. · Moderna's CMV (mRNA1647; TAM c.$2-5bn) trial is expected to provide interim analysis, possibly even the final analysis for efficacy in 2024. · Moderna/Vertex's Cystic Fibrosis (mRNA3692 / Vertex Vx522; TAM ?), phase 1/2 results are expected to be released by YE24. I reckon the financial impact on Moderna, if the drug is approved in a few years’ time, will be fairly modest. However, IF they could take their ""aerosol delivery"" LNP knowledge into other respiratory diseases it could mean no more arm jabs & instead smaller doses direct the lungs... Now that's seriously valuable! ACTIONS SET IN MOTION IN 2024, WHICH WILL IMPACT 2024 & 2025: · 27Mar24 Positive clinical trial data, led to 3 drugs (EBV, VZV, Norovirus) being moved to phase 3 · 29Apr24 It's seasonal Flu (mRNA1010; TAM c.$7bn) elicited some strong immune responses, with Moderna intending to file (for FDA approval) in 2024 · 02May24 Presentation explained that its cancer drug INT (mRNA4157; TAM of possibly $2-3bn per cancer type) had 3 phase 3 trials (Adjuvant melanoma, NSCLC & cSCC) & 2 phase 2 trials (RCC & bladder cancer) ongoing & that it hoped to file for ""accelerated approval."" IF approved it could mean INT sales in 2025 in the US & possibly also in other countries · 31May24 FDA approved Moderna's RSV (mRNA1345; TAM c.$10bn) vaccine. It will be on sale in the US in 2024 & is waiting for regulatory review in multiple other countries, with some likely to approve in 2024 & others 2025; · 07Jun24 Moderna asked the FDA to review its Covid NextGen (mRNA1283; TAM c.$10bn) 2024/25 formula (Note: It outperformed Spikevax with a 1/5th of its dose). Assuming it's approved, it will be ready for sale in 2025 ……………….. I think it’s fair to say I’m pretty bullish on Moderna! However, I find the Bird flu mania distracting & frankly hope that none of these vaccines are required. When I invested my long term pension assets, I bought into Moderna primarily on the strength of its’ platform & its’ ability to churn out a large variety of drugs across different modalities (i.e. Respiratory, cancer, latent diseases etc). This is something special, relatively unique & sets it apart from many other Pharma groups. Moderna’s plan to have 4 products on sale in 2025 (NextGen covid, Seasonal Flu, Flu/Covid & RSV), with a total of 15 products over the next 5 years is what excites me & I believe will drive my investment towards outsized profits! But, don’t take my word on it, Bancel on 31May 24 (""Bernstein's 40th Annual Strategic Decisions Conference"" at8.45) said ""I believe we are going to become the biggest vaccine company in the world, in that time frame [15 drugs in 5yrs] just because of the number of products we have, if you look at the number of products we have in the late stage development vaccine it is more than the rest of industry combined!"" [Note: Bancel isn’t shy about promoting Moderna!!!].","u/Huge_Philosopher5580 Q: Did Moderna & Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccines cause Rare cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart)?A: The short answer is, yes it did......... The more informed answer is that a research arm of the World Health Organization (the Global Vaccine Data Network) ""looked at expected versus observed rates of 13 medical conditions that were considered “adverse events of special interest” in a study population of 99 million vaccinated people [in] eight countries, making it the largest Covid vaccine study to date""........ However, the key bit of information that is either not known or is deliberately not disclosed is ""the odds of all of these adverse events is still much, much higher when infected with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), so getting vaccinated is still by far the safer choice” CEO of biotechnology company Centivax Jacob Glanville, who is not involved in the study, told Forbes.""
