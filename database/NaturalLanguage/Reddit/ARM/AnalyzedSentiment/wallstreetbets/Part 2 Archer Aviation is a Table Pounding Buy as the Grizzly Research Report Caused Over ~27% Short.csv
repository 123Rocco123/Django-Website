,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,0.999,NEGATIVE

I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.","If you have any idea how the FAA works, both on the regulatory level and on a practical aviation level, you would understand the profound difficulty any of these aviation startups will have in achieving any profitability.",0,0.508,0.948,NEGATIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range.

These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",YEP,2,0.5,0.998,POSITIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative.

It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",For the sake of OP’s sanity - I hope it was done by chat gpt,1,0.503,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it.

The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",I read the short report and analysed it. I felt it was necessary to do DD before I put in this bagger.,2,0.504,0.966,NEGATIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",You mean bagholder.

This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.","how about u eat my ASSI am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision.

Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",I have but it was the unibomber so…..,1,0.5,0.828,NEGATIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime.

Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative.

Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.","I have 20 3.50 calls for November 1st, there has been a few dark pool and whale orders on ARCHER this past week.",0,0.532,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation.

Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",This post aged beautifully,0,0.505,0.996,POSITIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company.

Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.","""""The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation.Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.”""""",0,0.517,0.704,NEGATIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute.

But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",Ohhhhhh juicy. Do you have a link. To this I'll update.,1,0.502,0.857,NEGATIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it.

,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism.

Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill.

Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.","Great question. The stock was $5 just a few weeks ago. Short seemingly started piling in when they had just let up. I've rode the stock down about ~28%. That's when I a DD and found the short.I think this stock can easily do $5 plus again from here to November / December. I could be just flat out wrong so. But I'm ok with it. I plan on staggering calls and buying shares. Just looking for good price action on calls which there is right now ie they're cheap. Oct 18, Nov 15 and I will keep going from there. I want to make sure I catch all positive news. I'm just going to keep building and rolling into new shares and calls.",2,0.56,0.836,NEGATIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan.

This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs.

The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",I think this is low risk and deep value.

,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft.

,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.","Holy shit.

If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.","Eh, I have no real comments on the shorts reports, but VTOL is an extremely difficult thing that military has spend hundreds of billions and 80 years trying to make work with not much reliable success. Helicopters are considered ""mature"" technology yet also still very dangerous. Energy density of oil is still vastly superior to any batteries available which puts some hard current limits on things like range versus capacity.That said, there's some key differences between those and evtol.From a risk management perspective, All it's going to take is one highly public Kobe Bryant or a Troy Gentry and the whole things going to crater. That's very hard to predict but it's still immature and early enough is that's all it going to take to eat massive losses.It's cheap enough I'll go ahead and put down some funny money on it in long, but it's money I've accepted could instantly go down in flames if a Kobe happens",0,0.525,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute.

Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.","That makes it worse, not better. If weather wipes out a traditional aircraft, people will say it was the result of weather. If weather wipes out an e-vtol (or any experimental aircraft) people will say it is the result of inferior machines. You've just identified a fact that will fuck over this company and think that it is a defense of them.",2,0.526,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report.

This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative.

Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",Someone agrees with OP’s assessment.

,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation.

According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",Damn is that you?

,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th.

San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",Yes its disheartening seeing share prices fall for NO reason but traders playing games. The main plant is almost finish and all indications the equipment needed to make the aircraft is being installed.

,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024.

Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan.

This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders.

Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.","Out of curiosity, what is your opinion on Joby. From my understanding they’re developing a direct competitor product but are much further along. I hold ACHR right now because I think they’re undervalued but you seem like you probably have done quite a bit of research on Joby as well",0,0.514,0.979,POSITIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me.

I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",Cathie has been making great plays lately,0,0.514,0.997,POSITIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done.

While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.","As an ARCH bagholder, I appreciate your post",0,0.502,0.958,POSITIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft.

Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",I try to do my research,1,0.505,0.593,POSITIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative.

With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",I don’t have patience to write long DD like this but can claim that I have done extensive research on this.My personal position is 100+ LEAPS for Joby and 2150 in stock.I only believe in Joby and I strongly feel Archer is going to fold or go bust in 4 years or less.I will give reasons for this in short as I don’t have patience n don’t have time or care to convince anyone.Joby truly developed eVTOL from scratch and have complete new new design. Archer is just electric helicopter where they are assembler of aircraft where why may have just swap the engine with electric motors. Due to this their aircraft is almost 1200lbs heavier than Joby. This in itself going to kill then in operating cost and cannot compete with Joby which will multi fold efficient n cheaper to operate thereby cheaper on pricingArcher is mostly style n less substance. Their flight has yet to do extensive flight testing. They are flying empty ✈️. So currently it’s just baloon with no payload. Once you add payload most likely their design will go bust. The design is too heavy n bulkyDilution- Archer is going for extensive dilution every quarter against plant setup and labor supply from Stellantis . Moreover they plan issue more shares.Archer certification in time is very difficult given they need to integrate number of desperate components n technology. Joby developed almost 80-90% IP in-house so they integrate seamlessly with common software language.Archer is led by businessman vs Joby is led by technocratJoby has successfully tested hydrogen flight. In 5-6 year they will have it approved. Then they will have huge cost advantage and unparalleled technology edgeAutonomy- only Joby has full autonomous rights to their own plane. Archer sold it to Wisk/Boeing. Robo Air-Taxi. This is where real money is. Believe me Robo AirTaxi will happen before Tesla/Waymo or Aurora.Once you do in depth study you will uncover few more obvious reasons why archer is way behind and over priced at current valuation.Overall Archer is not gonna pop it’s gonna poop 💩 soon.,0,0.524,0.994,NEGATIVE

Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump.

FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.","Holy shit.

,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time.

Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.","""Believe me Robo AirTaxi will happen before Tesla/Waymo or Aurora.""This is where you lost all your credibility.",1,0.499,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation.

However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.","Good DD - I have no issue with Joby but there are a few counter points to your DD that should be understood.You make a big deal about creating their own IP but Archer's counter point is that their parts are industry standard and can be purchased and produced more easily. Personally, I think both have a fair point. Archer also has their own IP in the most important parts which include the drive train.I really like the look and feel of Archer way more than Joby. Joby looks like they took a drone from DJI and scaled it up to a person capable aircraft. Not necessarily a bad thing but as far as style goes Archer definitely has that edge. Also, they will soon have their pilot test certification soon. So that's no really a great argument against them. Their for-test certification is coming soon and will be a major announcement.Nothing really to say here as this stuff ain't cheap. Raising capital is something they both have to do. It's not like you can make the argument that Joby doesn't have to do this too.Both are have delivered aircraft to the military and both are set to deliver more. Again, both will be players in this arena and that's a good thing. Competition is a good thing. Don't forget a short report and subsequent short float on Joby is a thing too as their short is about ~19%.The reason why I chose Archer however is that their current market cap has much deeper value than Joby at these current levels.Currently Joby is valued at $3.74 Billion while Archer Aviation is valued at only $1.09 Billion with a much higher float. So, with all of that I have to think Archer at this moment is a better buy. Both of their market caps can easily be in the $50 - $100 Billion range in the 4 - 6 year future which will be a substantial gain for all those invested. In the short term, if Archer keeps pushing and gets their certs a 3x increase will be a $3 Billion market cap and that seems completely justified. That would also be a 300% increase in the stock price from $3 to $9 a share. I say this is an easy bagger if you ask me. Deep fucking value if there ever was one.",1,0.533,0.999,POSITIVE

Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.","Archer is really trying hard to project itself in same league as Joby and they have been successful largely in their plan to create that image but reality is they are no way close to Joby.Archer outstanding shares are going to increase at least double in next year alone due to dilution to Stellantis and others.You not assigning any premium to fact that Joby has enormous IP capital- whole design, hydrogen, autonomous , software/hardware, almost 90% parts and way ahead in progress.Archer looks are sexy but that extra weight to make it sexy makes it commercially not viable against nimble Joby as per mile cost will be too high (assuming bulky Archer can lift that payload). Joby did incredible job at reducing weight by redesigning everything.",2,0.527,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative.

Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational.

Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest.

Don't forget, Archer first started off with the Maker which was a smaller aircraft.The hydrogen thing is not really important right now so let's get these guys flying first and then we can advance to more payload, larger eVTOL's in general and further distances. I think the pipeline for both of these companies will be great. They just need to get off the ground first. Literally.Again, one has a current market cap of 3.47 B and the other only 1 B.

Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",Archer is not valueless but it’s going bankrupt at some point and then they have only one buyer- Wisk/Boeing. Who will buy them for scrap value.,4,0.531,0.998,NEGATIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation.

Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",They literally have major investors that have literally just recently invested including the US government. What are you talking about. You must be Grizzly with a short to have written this much in my DD report. Good luck with your short. Let's see how it all pans out.,5,0.517,0.998,NEGATIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00.

Your DD conveniently ignores why Archer is weak and valued correctly. You keep comparing to Joby. I say if Joby is $3M then yes Archer at $1M with impending HUGE HUGE HUGE dilution is overvalued at $1M.Don’t have any shorts or long or anything abt Archer.I wish you luck with your conviction and hope I’m wrong but this not smelling good from get go.You mentioned Maker… that was toy and how much flight details data have they released on that or even about midnight.Why founders fought and one left.

Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.","So basically, flying car go brrrr?",0,0.501,0.988,NEGATIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis.

Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025.

Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.","If this guy is betting on this > Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia Then I promise he has not seen the Dukes of Hazzard...or Smokey and the Bandit.Good luck on the high tech wizardry coming out of Covington, Georgia.",0,0.524,0.588,NEGATIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me.

Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",Guys! Good news Joby popped 20% today on added investment from Toyota! that is great news for the entire industry.,0,0.542,0.996,POSITIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks.

This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",Bet you’re feeling pretty well validated now! Awesome DD!!,0,0.518,0.999,POSITIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front.

And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.","I also got 100 contracts of $4 nov 1st, let’s gooooo",0,0.541,0.762,POSITIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative.

Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft.

Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan.

Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest.

Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",how confident we feeling,1,0.51,0.999,POSITIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it.

However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.","we gettin a bag, easy",2,0.503,0.644,NEGATIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM.

The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",It's deep value right now.

,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute.

In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.","BTW Motley fool also said this, https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/09/26/could-investing-50000-in-archer-aviation-make-you/ inveting $50,000 to make you a millionaire.",1,0.566,0.994,NEGATIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime.

Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",Hell of a research. Thank you.,0,0.5,0.986,POSITIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time.

Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",I have some 2026 calls lol,0,0.51,0.907,POSITIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00.

Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.","I have a stock for you. Netflix!

,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported.

TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",Congrats I’m gonna buy a few shares.

,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis.

In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",sure i will get some calls just for lols,0,0.511,0.508,POSITIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in.

While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",Looks like I’m buying more 2026 3.00 calls tomorrow,0,0.506,0.915,POSITIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front.

Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",3k in 7$ april 25 calls,0,0.515,0.999,NEGATIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative.

Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.","Nice DD, thanks for taking the time and effort to make it.I've looked into Archer a few times now and while I'm tempted to buy in, I have a couple of hurdles I'm struggling to get over. First of all I'm having a hard time seeing a scenario where they aren't just acquired by another megacorp. Boeing going balls-deep and consolidating them with Wisk makes a lot of sense; both companies are functionally the same, it merely seems to be the case that Archer want to push a more VIP and military-oriented aircraft line-up while Wisk is designed much more in the mould of an air-taxi Uber. Stellantis might also be interested in a direct acquisition if they can envision a more profitable return by cutting out other major investors like United and Boeing, as well as gaining them exposure to valuable US military contracts.I'm also not fully convinced by the eVTOL air-taxi concept. As a means of rapid transportation it does have potential (is there anyone who doesn't want to reach their destination not just in style but also half an hour earlier??) but I need to know exactly how they're going to make it affordable for people that aren't just high-income earners, because otherwise it will ultimately be an unprofitable service due to the complexity of the technology and the lack of a large clientele base. The stock has a lot of potential but the hurdles are really fucking big, I ain't gonna lie.",0,0.539,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it.

Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.","So what are we thinking here, January of 25 calls?",0,0.518,0.999,NEGATIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company.

Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",I thought Joby is the leader? Their stock is also pretty cheap.,0,0.599,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly.

Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders.

Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.","When the SFAR comes out in October, the press will write: ""FAA authorizes commercial operation of eVTOLs"" ""FAA launches new era of air mobility"". The time to buy is now, not later",0,0.547,0.528,NEGATIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested.

Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",Went YOLO on it!

,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”.

With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",Bought 100 $5 contracts April 2025,0,0.518,0.977,POSITIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information.

What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",Options down ~40% today.

,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company.

This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",Okay I’m in,0,0.5,0.726,NEGATIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft.

Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",it couldn't fit the screen,1,0.5,1.0,NEGATIVE

Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",Dang that's a lot of words I ain't gonna read but I'm kinda glad Robinhood executed my call for me without me asking. Gonna cancel the sell I placed on half my shares.,0,0.519,0.91,NEGATIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute.

Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.","Already have ~1k shares & a handful of calls for next year. Each time it drops i throw a bit more in, not earth shattering amounts, but a few hundred here & there.They have been permitted in NY & CA already with Florida being worked on(from what I know, obviously i don't know everything).Thanks to your amazing DD, think I will start loading more calls, thanks for that!!P.S. your military case is more right on than you know. These are coming, the investment from the DoD is there and many are excited about it. They will be used for troop & equipment transport in CA very soon(they have many bases in fairly close proximity so the use is obvious). There's talk of putting them on some ships to gather supplies without needing to go inland, so many uses have been discussed-with more uses being revealed all the time. I see the military being a large enough customer even without the commercial aspects, but they have that too!I too believe that ACHR will be huge in the coming years!",0,0.522,0.993,POSITIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company.

Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational.

Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest.

Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information. Update: Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms. A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from MarketBeat.com, Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00. Update 2: This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.","You had me until Stellantis.Literally the biggest POS automaker, wouldn’t touch anything they invest in with a 10ft pole",0,0.505,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation.

Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.” “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to [industry] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.” The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices. Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range. However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR. “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver [the rule] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.” While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorization bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release. There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",When you try to make the argument that dilution is good for shareholders you lose a lot of credibility.,0,0.514,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"I did some digging because I felt my previous DD on Archer Aviation wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information. Other DD's you may remember that have been spot on are of ARM, ARM_2, NVIDIA, VRT, MICROSOFT, APPLE and others. When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in. Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF. In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis. First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a ~19% and ~22% short in the eVTOL startups respectively. Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”. Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written. Grizzly's article you can read for yourself but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023): Misleading DoD contract: Claim: Archer’s DoD contract was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract, with only $1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023, far less significant than portrayed. Reference: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023."" Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Claim: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a handful of flights, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress. Reference: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights."" Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Claim: Archer’s partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant. Reference: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation."" FAA Certification Timeline: Claim: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive Type Certification for its Midnight aircraft until at least 2028, not 2024 as Archer claimed. Reference: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate."" Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Claim: Archer settled a legal dispute with Wisk/Boeing by giving $100 million in free shares to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims. Reference: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing."" Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Claim: Archer promised its San Jose lab and small-scale production facility would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines. Reference: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Claim: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing free shares to partners like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense. Reference: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early."" All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it. Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024. ***Misleading DoD contract: Reality: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft. Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the U.S. Air Force as part of its $142 million contract under the AFWERX Agility Prime program. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results. Use of Aircraft: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also pilot training, maintenance, and certification support, further validating the value of the contract *Flight Activity Misrepresentation: Reality: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report. Ongoing Flight Testing: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the Midnight eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed daily test flights in preparation for their FAA certification and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested. Video Footage Authenticity: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants: Reality: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments. United Airlines has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In August 2023, United was part of a $215 million investment round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a $10 million pre-delivery payment for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft. Stellantis, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In January 2023, Stellantis committed $150 million in equity and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the Midnight eVTOL. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer. Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. *****FAA Certification Timeline: Reality: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification. Significant FAA Milestones Achieved: Archer has made substantial progress in its FAA certification pathway: Final Airworthiness Criteria: On May 23, 2024, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria for the Midnight aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification. Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate and Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations For-Credit Flight Testing: As of September 2024, Archer successfully completed 402 test flights. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for for-credit flight testing, which is expected to begin in early 2024. Delivery to the U.S. Air Force: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. Part 135 Certification: On August 15, 2024, Archer delivered its first Midnight aircraft to the U.S. Air Force under the AFWERX Agility Prime program, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. ***Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing: Reality: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them. Collaboration Instead of Defeat: The settlement has evolved into a collaboration agreement between Archer and Wisk, with Boeing as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft. Boeing Investment: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a significant investment in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like Stellantis and United Airlines. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. ***Incomplete Manufacturing Facility: Reality: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis. San Jose Facility: Archer completed the installation of its high-volume battery pack manufacturing line at the San Jose Integrated Test Lab in May 2024. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to 15,000 battery packs per year, a crucial step toward scaling production. Conforming Midnight Aircraft: Archer’s first conforming Midnight aircraft is expected to be completed in Q4 2023, with flight testing set to begin in early 2024. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress. Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility: In addition, Archer began construction on a high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia in March 2023. This facility, projected to support the production of up to 650 eVTOL aircraft per year, is on track for completion in 2024, ahead of the Midnight eVTOL’s planned entry into service in 2025. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to complete construction by the end of the year as of July 2024. ***Stock Dilution and Early Vesting: Reality: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis. Stellantis Partnership: Since August 2023, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing $55 million following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to 650 aircraft annually once their Covington, Georgia facility is operational. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders. Wisk/Boeing Settlement: The Boeing/Wisk settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to autonomy technology, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a $215 million funding round, which included other major investors like United Airlines and ARK Invest. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs. As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision. If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported. Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August. My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute. I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify. While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations. This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft. With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares. Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information.
