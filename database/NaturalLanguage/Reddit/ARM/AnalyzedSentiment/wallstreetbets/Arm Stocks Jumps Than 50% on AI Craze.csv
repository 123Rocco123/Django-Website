,"""Shares of British chip designer Arm surged more than 50% after its earnings report surprised analysts and suggested artificial intelligence may be driving a recovery in the semiconductor industry. The company said it made a record $824 million of sales in its last quarter, and projected as much as $900 million for the current quarter. Both figures topped Wall Street expectations, reflecting a recovery in demand for parts of the chip industry fueled in large part by big investments in artificial intelligence computing. Arm shares rose to about $115 Thursday, sending its market value to over $117 billion and more than doubling its price at its initial public offering last year. Arm’s chip designs are in nearly all the world’s smartphones, making its results an indicator of the health of the handset market. A faster-than-expected shift to AI gave a boost to the results, Arm executives said. Many of the latest Arm-based smartphone chips have AI capabilities built in, and Arm-based circuits are part of some of the most advanced AI systems made by Nvidia, the leader in AI computing. “Given we are in the very early innings of AI adoption, we expect Arm’s sales to remain robust” in the coming years, analysts at Citi said in a note. Arm’s earnings surprise and market surge come at a time of mixed fortunes for the broader chip industry. Qualcomm, a major designer of mobile-phone chips, reported better-than-expected results last month. Nvidia has reported several quarters of blockbuster results as AI investments skyrocket, sending its shares to new highs and making it one of the world’s most valuable companies. Intel has had healthier sales in recent months as the personal-computer market recovers, although the company last month gave a muted outlook due to weakness in its programmable-chip and self-driving units.""

Maybe selling limited blocks of stock with a limit on the price sold for each blockHowever, I don’t have real knowledge of how institutions manage large scale trades to maximize return.What do you think?I also don’t know how best to take advantage of this. I am not comfortable trading options. I came into the recent run up holding 450 shares, sold all for a short term profit and then bought 450 shares when the stock dropped, then sold again (at $143 /share) for a profit, then just bought 500 shares today at $128 / share. I expect the stock will go up again in the next few days and that it will continue to be very volatile.What I am not sure of is at what price SoftBank will be selling after March 12. It will probably be somewhat less than whatever the market price is on March 11. I would like to be a long term owner of ARM.
