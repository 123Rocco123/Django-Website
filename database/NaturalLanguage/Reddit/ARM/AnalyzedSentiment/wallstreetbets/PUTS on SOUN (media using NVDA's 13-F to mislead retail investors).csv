,"Hi all - I almost never post but the recent run-up of SOUN (as well as NNOX, RXRX) are pure hype being driven by the media's incorrect interpretation of NVDA's recent 13-F filing. Companies that hold >$100M of public equities are required to report an 13-F filing. NVDA filed their first ever 13-F report on February 14th, 2024. The media picked that up and is spinning the narrative as if NVDA just initiated these positions and are going to establish some kind of strategic relationship. That is not the case. The reality is that NVDA was only recently required to file a 13-F report because they invested $100M in ARM's IPO. This pushed their total holdings above the $100M threshold and made them report on all of their public equity positions. Many of these positions were established a long time ago and have no basis on any meaningful strategic relationship. SOUN is one such example. Per Pitchbook, Nvidia invested in SOUN during the companies Series C (2015) and Series D (2017) rounds. This was made by Nvidia GPU Ventures, which invests in AI startups to support the NVDA GPU ecosystem. There hasn't been any meaningful partnerships announced between NVDA and SOUN since they invested. So what is SOUN? They're a voice-recognition AI company like Shazam (but smaller). The company went public via. SPAC in April 2022, raised a bunch of equity, burned it all, and raised a bunch of debt to stay afloat. Earnings are on 2/29.

,"Hi all - I almost never post but the recent run-up of SOUN (as well as NNOX, RXRX) are pure hype being driven by the media's incorrect interpretation of NVDA's recent 13-F filing. Companies that hold >$100M of public equities are required to report an 13-F filing. NVDA filed their first ever 13-F report on February 14th, 2024. The media picked that up and is spinning the narrative as if NVDA just initiated these positions and are going to establish some kind of strategic relationship. That is not the case. The reality is that NVDA was only recently required to file a 13-F report because they invested $100M in ARM's IPO. This pushed their total holdings above the $100M threshold and made them report on all of their public equity positions. Many of these positions were established a long time ago and have no basis on any meaningful strategic relationship. SOUN is one such example. Per Pitchbook, Nvidia invested in SOUN during the companies Series C (2015) and Series D (2017) rounds. This was made by Nvidia GPU Ventures, which invests in AI startups to support the NVDA GPU ecosystem. There hasn't been any meaningful partnerships announced between NVDA and SOUN since they invested. So what is SOUN? They're a voice-recognition AI company like Shazam (but smaller).
