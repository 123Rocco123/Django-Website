,"Hi, me again. I gave you the AMD DD yesterday (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1biqt1k/dd_i_ddd_the_nvidia_run_up_last_year_250700_and/). I liked reading all the insight from people smarter than me and the regardation in the comments, thank you for that. I'm here today to talk about the B200 because it came up a lot. What I'm going to show is that AMD will still sell a lot of MI300Xs even when it comes out. First let me say the B200 is great and will be the leader, and will sell a gazillions. However, for whatever reason Nvidia decided to make their stats and metrics highly misleading in their announcement, especially for laymen who don't know what the fuck they are looking at and just see big numbers and monkey brain instincts kick in. The B200 and GB200 do have a sizeable lead on the MI300X, but its not 4x or 1000x or whatever I was seeing in the comments. The raw performance difference from MI300X to B200 is 90% for FLOPs and 51% for memory bandwidth. The B200 has 36% more transistors than the MI300X, so it is simply a larger chip (by transistor) and that accounts for a lot of the difference. AMD can scale their next chip up if they want more FLOPs and memory bandwidth too. Basically the issues with Nvidia's announcement boil down to 1) not revealing their methodology, 2) doing apples to oranges comparisons, and 3) giving metrics that are intentionally misleading so people watching do apples to oranges comparisons. I'm not going to cover everything, but I will just give a quick rundown of how I got to my numbers. We are going to use these two pages: https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gb200-nvl72/ https://www.amd.com/en/products/accelerators/instinct/mi300/mi300x.html First lets define what we are talking about. MI300X The MI300X is basically like a giant GPU. Up to 8 of them fit in a big computer that goes in a rack in a datacenter. They are connected to the server using PCIE like your graphics card, but are also interconnected with each other using Infinity Fabric cables. Infinity Fabric is important because it allows the cards to bypass the CPU when transferring data from one card to another. AMD's metrics are for one card. GB200 The GB200 is a giant two-rack computer. It is made up of 72 individual graphics cards and 36 CPUs. Nvidia's version of Infinity Fabric is called NVLink, and all of the 72 GPUs and 36 CPUs are all connected to one another using NVLink. This is the largest interconnection of its kind, which is the impressive part of the GB200. Nvlink also can connect multiple GB200s together so all of their GPUs can talk with one another. This scale of Nvlink is really the killer app of the GB200, not the chips. In Nvidia's marketing material, it shows metrics for one whole GB200 system and also for one GB200 ""superchip"" which includes 2 GPUs and a CPU. Superchip is intentionally misleading though, because its 3 separate chips on a board (and one is a CPU), not one big chip. 2x GB200 ""superchips"" each with 2 GPUs and 1 CPU B200 The B200 is a single giant GPU. Its probably something like what each of the GPUs on the ""superchips"" are, but we don't know for sure. Either way its a single chip like the MI300X. I'm going to call the GPUs on the superchips B200s for simplicity sake. Nvidia's Long Green Dick Bar Charts I've looked through all of these, and they are all almost completely meaningless other than as trend indicators. They don't tell you even what metrics are being shown other than a two word description. Forget testing methodologies and all the details needed to understand them. I can tell you that the massive NVLink setup in the GB200 is going to lead to huge efficiency and clustering improvements, but on an individual chip basis, there is not as big of a difference between the B200 and the H200 or MI300X other than size. Comparing apples-to-apples The MI300X's specs are plainly available, but nvidia hasn't released all of them for the B200 yet. Nvidia does give us 10 PFLOPs per ""superchip"" of 16 bit floating point with sparsity (this is a common type of number for AI) and AMD gives us 2.61 PFLOPs per card. Remember, the ""superchip"" is actually 3 chips on a board: a CPU and two GPUs. The CPU on the GB200 superchip is probably providing a minuscule amount of FP16 compared to the GPUs, so we can just divide the number by 2 to get 5. So that's the best metric we can get right now: 2.61 AMD vs 5 Nvidia (FP16 PFLOPs w/ sparsity) or 90% more. Memory Bandwidth For LLM inference, or what happens when you type ""tldr this wsb post:"" into chatgpt, memory bandwidth is the most important bottleneck. Nvidia gives us a comparable figure for this: 16 TB/s for 2 GPUs or 8 TB/s per B200. The MI300X has 5.3 TB/s of memory bandwidth, so the B200 is running with 51% more memory bandwidth. Yes its good, but not out of this world The new nvidia chips coming out later this year are a solid generational move and will be great for customers. However there is no magic, and most of their per-chip performance increase from previous nvidia chips is because they are a lot larger. The H100 and H200 are 80B transistors, the MI300X is 153B transistors, and this new B200 is 208B transistors. There is no magic with the new B200 other than it is a lot bigger in terms of transistor count and has slightly smaller more efficient transistors. The real killer app of the B200 is the way it can be combined with hundreds or thousands of other B200s using NVLink. AMD does have Infinity Fabric which connects 8 GPUs, but they haven't done this scale of integration yet. However its a reasonable assumption AMD can scale Infinity Link in the same way, so this isn't putting AMD out of the question for its next generation. Where does the MI300X fit in? Read my other post for more details about the AMD value proposition, but I'll do a quick summary here. Remember that the MI300X is probably currently the leader in performance and will be until the B200 comes out. That gives it 9 months give or take at the top. However, it does not need to remain the leader to sell in a volume that will be a huge increase in revenue and profit for AMD. There are plenty of niches that the MI300X does fill that the B200 doesn't. For instance the MI300X does have over double the 64 bit floating point performance of the B200. 64 bit floats are used in scientific modelling but not in AI. Presumably Nvidia will release another card that competes for general compute performance, but the MI300X does both AI and large scale compute well. Also for smaller deployments that can't leverage NVLink's large scaling efficiencies, the MI300X can easily make sense. The MI300X does have a similar interconnect at 8-card scale with Infinity Fabric. Also its likely companies will pick up the MI300X simply to diversify so Nvidia doesn't have negotiating leverage on them or because they want to reduce supply chain risk. Lastly AMD can always drop the price and still have a huge profit margin. Its easy for me to imagine a 15% AMD AI accelerator market share with the B200 existing for these reasons. Furthermore, none of the additions from the GB200 or B200 are serious moats for Nvidia that AMD can't cross. AMD can scale up its chip transistor counts, add more stacks of HBM, and scale Infinity Link in the same way. The GB200 is great, but it does not represent a hurdle AMD can't cross.",Once you go Blackwell you never go Backwell,0,0.502,0.862,POSITIVE

,"Hi, me again. I gave you the AMD DD yesterday (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1biqt1k/dd_i_ddd_the_nvidia_run_up_last_year_250700_and/). I liked reading all the insight from people smarter than me and the regardation in the comments, thank you for that. I'm here today to talk about the B200 because it came up a lot. What I'm going to show is that AMD will still sell a lot of MI300Xs even when it comes out. First let me say the B200 is great and will be the leader, and will sell a gazillions. However, for whatever reason Nvidia decided to make their stats and metrics highly misleading in their announcement, especially for laymen who don't know what the fuck they are looking at and just see big numbers and monkey brain instincts kick in. The B200 and GB200 do have a sizeable lead on the MI300X, but its not 4x or 1000x or whatever I was seeing in the comments. The raw performance difference from MI300X to B200 is 90% for FLOPs and 51% for memory bandwidth. The B200 has 36% more transistors than the MI300X, so it is simply a larger chip (by transistor) and that accounts for a lot of the difference. AMD can scale their next chip up if they want more FLOPs and memory bandwidth too. Basically the issues with Nvidia's announcement boil down to 1) not revealing their methodology, 2) doing apples to oranges comparisons, and 3) giving metrics that are intentionally misleading so people watching do apples to oranges comparisons. I'm not going to cover everything, but I will just give a quick rundown of how I got to my numbers. We are going to use these two pages: https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gb200-nvl72/ https://www.amd.com/en/products/accelerators/instinct/mi300/mi300x.html First lets define what we are talking about. MI300X The MI300X is basically like a giant GPU. Up to 8 of them fit in a big computer that goes in a rack in a datacenter. They are connected to the server using PCIE like your graphics card, but are also interconnected with each other using Infinity Fabric cables. Infinity Fabric is important because it allows the cards to bypass the CPU when transferring data from one card to another. AMD's metrics are for one card. GB200 The GB200 is a giant two-rack computer. It is made up of 72 individual graphics cards and 36 CPUs. Nvidia's version of Infinity Fabric is called NVLink, and all of the 72 GPUs and 36 CPUs are all connected to one another using NVLink. This is the largest interconnection of its kind, which is the impressive part of the GB200. Nvlink also can connect multiple GB200s together so all of their GPUs can talk with one another. This scale of Nvlink is really the killer app of the GB200, not the chips. In Nvidia's marketing material, it shows metrics for one whole GB200 system and also for one GB200 ""superchip"" which includes 2 GPUs and a CPU. Superchip is intentionally misleading though, because its 3 separate chips on a board (and one is a CPU), not one big chip. 2x GB200 ""superchips"" each with 2 GPUs and 1 CPU B200 The B200 is a single giant GPU. Its probably something like what each of the GPUs on the ""superchips"" are, but we don't know for sure. Either way its a single chip like the MI300X. I'm going to call the GPUs on the superchips B200s for simplicity sake. Nvidia's Long Green Dick Bar Charts I've looked through all of these, and they are all almost completely meaningless other than as trend indicators. They don't tell you even what metrics are being shown other than a two word description. Forget testing methodologies and all the details needed to understand them. I can tell you that the massive NVLink setup in the GB200 is going to lead to huge efficiency and clustering improvements, but on an individual chip basis, there is not as big of a difference between the B200 and the H200 or MI300X other than size. Comparing apples-to-apples The MI300X's specs are plainly available, but nvidia hasn't released all of them for the B200 yet. Nvidia does give us 10 PFLOPs per ""superchip"" of 16 bit floating point with sparsity (this is a common type of number for AI) and AMD gives us 2.61 PFLOPs per card. Remember, the ""superchip"" is actually 3 chips on a board: a CPU and two GPUs. The CPU on the GB200 superchip is probably providing a minuscule amount of FP16 compared to the GPUs, so we can just divide the number by 2 to get 5. So that's the best metric we can get right now: 2.61 AMD vs 5 Nvidia (FP16 PFLOPs w/ sparsity) or 90% more. Memory Bandwidth For LLM inference, or what happens when you type ""tldr this wsb post:"" into chatgpt, memory bandwidth is the most important bottleneck. Nvidia gives us a comparable figure for this: 16 TB/s for 2 GPUs or 8 TB/s per B200. The MI300X has 5.3 TB/s of memory bandwidth, so the B200 is running with 51% more memory bandwidth. Yes its good, but not out of this world The new nvidia chips coming out later this year are a solid generational move and will be great for customers. However there is no magic, and most of their per-chip performance increase from previous nvidia chips is because they are a lot larger. The H100 and H200 are 80B transistors, the MI300X is 153B transistors, and this new B200 is 208B transistors. There is no magic with the new B200 other than it is a lot bigger in terms of transistor count and has slightly smaller more efficient transistors. The real killer app of the B200 is the way it can be combined with hundreds or thousands of other B200s using NVLink. AMD does have Infinity Fabric which connects 8 GPUs, but they haven't done this scale of integration yet. However its a reasonable assumption AMD can scale Infinity Link in the same way, so this isn't putting AMD out of the question for its next generation. Where does the MI300X fit in? Read my other post for more details about the AMD value proposition, but I'll do a quick summary here. Remember that the MI300X is probably currently the leader in performance and will be until the B200 comes out. That gives it 9 months give or take at the top. However, it does not need to remain the leader to sell in a volume that will be a huge increase in revenue and profit for AMD. There are plenty of niches that the MI300X does fill that the B200 doesn't. For instance the MI300X does have over double the 64 bit floating point performance of the B200. 64 bit floats are used in scientific modelling but not in AI. Presumably Nvidia will release another card that competes for general compute performance, but the MI300X does both AI and large scale compute well. Also for smaller deployments that can't leverage NVLink's large scaling efficiencies, the MI300X can easily make sense. The MI300X does have a similar interconnect at 8-card scale with Infinity Fabric. Also its likely companies will pick up the MI300X simply to diversify so Nvidia doesn't have negotiating leverage on them or because they want to reduce supply chain risk. Lastly AMD can always drop the price and still have a huge profit margin. Its easy for me to imagine a 15% AMD AI accelerator market share with the B200 existing for these reasons. Furthermore, none of the additions from the GB200 or B200 are serious moats for Nvidia that AMD can't cross. AMD can scale up its chip transistor counts, add more stacks of HBM, and scale Infinity Link in the same way. The GB200 is great, but it does not represent a hurdle AMD can't cross.",Yep exactly.

,"Hi, me again. I gave you the AMD DD yesterday (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1biqt1k/dd_i_ddd_the_nvidia_run_up_last_year_250700_and/). I liked reading all the insight from people smarter than me and the regardation in the comments, thank you for that. I'm here today to talk about the B200 because it came up a lot. What I'm going to show is that AMD will still sell a lot of MI300Xs even when it comes out. First let me say the B200 is great and will be the leader, and will sell a gazillions. However, for whatever reason Nvidia decided to make their stats and metrics highly misleading in their announcement, especially for laymen who don't know what the fuck they are looking at and just see big numbers and monkey brain instincts kick in. The B200 and GB200 do have a sizeable lead on the MI300X, but its not 4x or 1000x or whatever I was seeing in the comments. The raw performance difference from MI300X to B200 is 90% for FLOPs and 51% for memory bandwidth. The B200 has 36% more transistors than the MI300X, so it is simply a larger chip (by transistor) and that accounts for a lot of the difference. AMD can scale their next chip up if they want more FLOPs and memory bandwidth too. Basically the issues with Nvidia's announcement boil down to 1) not revealing their methodology, 2) doing apples to oranges comparisons, and 3) giving metrics that are intentionally misleading so people watching do apples to oranges comparisons. I'm not going to cover everything, but I will just give a quick rundown of how I got to my numbers. We are going to use these two pages: https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gb200-nvl72/ https://www.amd.com/en/products/accelerators/instinct/mi300/mi300x.html First lets define what we are talking about. MI300X The MI300X is basically like a giant GPU. Up to 8 of them fit in a big computer that goes in a rack in a datacenter. They are connected to the server using PCIE like your graphics card, but are also interconnected with each other using Infinity Fabric cables. Infinity Fabric is important because it allows the cards to bypass the CPU when transferring data from one card to another. AMD's metrics are for one card. GB200 The GB200 is a giant two-rack computer. It is made up of 72 individual graphics cards and 36 CPUs. Nvidia's version of Infinity Fabric is called NVLink, and all of the 72 GPUs and 36 CPUs are all connected to one another using NVLink. This is the largest interconnection of its kind, which is the impressive part of the GB200. Nvlink also can connect multiple GB200s together so all of their GPUs can talk with one another. This scale of Nvlink is really the killer app of the GB200, not the chips. In Nvidia's marketing material, it shows metrics for one whole GB200 system and also for one GB200 ""superchip"" which includes 2 GPUs and a CPU. Superchip is intentionally misleading though, because its 3 separate chips on a board (and one is a CPU), not one big chip. 2x GB200 ""superchips"" each with 2 GPUs and 1 CPU B200 The B200 is a single giant GPU. Its probably something like what each of the GPUs on the ""superchips"" are, but we don't know for sure. Either way its a single chip like the MI300X. I'm going to call the GPUs on the superchips B200s for simplicity sake. Nvidia's Long Green Dick Bar Charts I've looked through all of these, and they are all almost completely meaningless other than as trend indicators. They don't tell you even what metrics are being shown other than a two word description. Forget testing methodologies and all the details needed to understand them. I can tell you that the massive NVLink setup in the GB200 is going to lead to huge efficiency and clustering improvements, but on an individual chip basis, there is not as big of a difference between the B200 and the H200 or MI300X other than size. Comparing apples-to-apples The MI300X's specs are plainly available, but nvidia hasn't released all of them for the B200 yet. Nvidia does give us 10 PFLOPs per ""superchip"" of 16 bit floating point with sparsity (this is a common type of number for AI) and AMD gives us 2.61 PFLOPs per card. Remember, the ""superchip"" is actually 3 chips on a board: a CPU and two GPUs. The CPU on the GB200 superchip is probably providing a minuscule amount of FP16 compared to the GPUs, so we can just divide the number by 2 to get 5. So that's the best metric we can get right now: 2.61 AMD vs 5 Nvidia (FP16 PFLOPs w/ sparsity) or 90% more. Memory Bandwidth For LLM inference, or what happens when you type ""tldr this wsb post:"" into chatgpt, memory bandwidth is the most important bottleneck. Nvidia gives us a comparable figure for this: 16 TB/s for 2 GPUs or 8 TB/s per B200. The MI300X has 5.3 TB/s of memory bandwidth, so the B200 is running with 51% more memory bandwidth. Yes its good, but not out of this world The new nvidia chips coming out later this year are a solid generational move and will be great for customers. However there is no magic, and most of their per-chip performance increase from previous nvidia chips is because they are a lot larger. The H100 and H200 are 80B transistors, the MI300X is 153B transistors, and this new B200 is 208B transistors. There is no magic with the new B200 other than it is a lot bigger in terms of transistor count and has slightly smaller more efficient transistors. The real killer app of the B200 is the way it can be combined with hundreds or thousands of other B200s using NVLink. AMD does have Infinity Fabric which connects 8 GPUs, but they haven't done this scale of integration yet. However its a reasonable assumption AMD can scale Infinity Link in the same way, so this isn't putting AMD out of the question for its next generation. Where does the MI300X fit in? Read my other post for more details about the AMD value proposition, but I'll do a quick summary here. Remember that the MI300X is probably currently the leader in performance and will be until the B200 comes out. That gives it 9 months give or take at the top. However, it does not need to remain the leader to sell in a volume that will be a huge increase in revenue and profit for AMD.

The H100 and H200 are 80B transistors, the MI300X is 153B transistors, and this new B200 is 208B transistors. There is no magic with the new B200 other than it is a lot bigger in terms of transistor count and has slightly smaller more efficient transistors. The real killer app of the B200 is the way it can be combined with hundreds or thousands of other B200s using NVLink. AMD does have Infinity Fabric which connects 8 GPUs, but they haven't done this scale of integration yet. However its a reasonable assumption AMD can scale Infinity Link in the same way, so this isn't putting AMD out of the question for its next generation. Where does the MI300X fit in? Read my other post for more details about the AMD value proposition, but I'll do a quick summary here. Remember that the MI300X is probably currently the leader in performance and will be until the B200 comes out. That gives it 9 months give or take at the top. However, it does not need to remain the leader to sell in a volume that will be a huge increase in revenue and profit for AMD. There are plenty of niches that the MI300X does fill that the B200 doesn't. For instance the MI300X does have over double the 64 bit floating point performance of the B200. 64 bit floats are used in scientific modelling but not in AI. Presumably Nvidia will release another card that competes for general compute performance, but the MI300X does both AI and large scale compute well. Also for smaller deployments that can't leverage NVLink's large scaling efficiencies, the MI300X can easily make sense. The MI300X does have a similar interconnect at 8-card scale with Infinity Fabric. Also its likely companies will pick up the MI300X simply to diversify so Nvidia doesn't have negotiating leverage on them or because they want to reduce supply chain risk. Lastly AMD can always drop the price and still have a huge profit margin. Its easy for me to imagine a 15% AMD AI accelerator market share with the B200 existing for these reasons. Furthermore, none of the additions from the GB200 or B200 are serious moats for Nvidia that AMD can't cross. AMD can scale up its chip transistor counts, add more stacks of HBM, and scale Infinity Link in the same way. The GB200 is great, but it does not represent a hurdle AMD can't cross.","as tinygrad showed the problem with AMD is at the instruction level right now (might be different between the consumer chips and the DC chips, but I somewhat doubt this).on top of that, add that there isn't this fast interconnect available - you thought 400GbE is fast? try external NVlink switches. they are a killer feature.as much as I love AMD, AMD can't hold a candle yet to B200.",0,0.545,0.528,POSITIVE

What I'm going to show is that AMD will still sell a lot of MI300Xs even when it comes out. First let me say the B200 is great and will be the leader, and will sell a gazillions. However, for whatever reason Nvidia decided to make their stats and metrics highly misleading in their announcement, especially for laymen who don't know what the fuck they are looking at and just see big numbers and monkey brain instincts kick in. The B200 and GB200 do have a sizeable lead on the MI300X, but its not 4x or 1000x or whatever I was seeing in the comments. The raw performance difference from MI300X to B200 is 90% for FLOPs and 51% for memory bandwidth. The B200 has 36% more transistors than the MI300X, so it is simply a larger chip (by transistor) and that accounts for a lot of the difference. AMD can scale their next chip up if they want more FLOPs and memory bandwidth too. Basically the issues with Nvidia's announcement boil down to 1) not revealing their methodology, 2) doing apples to oranges comparisons, and 3) giving metrics that are intentionally misleading so people watching do apples to oranges comparisons. I'm not going to cover everything, but I will just give a quick rundown of how I got to my numbers. We are going to use these two pages: https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gb200-nvl72/ https://www.amd.com/en/products/accelerators/instinct/mi300/mi300x.html First lets define what we are talking about. MI300X The MI300X is basically like a giant GPU. Up to 8 of them fit in a big computer that goes in a rack in a datacenter. They are connected to the server using PCIE like your graphics card, but are also interconnected with each other using Infinity Fabric cables. Infinity Fabric is important because it allows the cards to bypass the CPU when transferring data from one card to another. AMD's metrics are for one card. GB200 The GB200 is a giant two-rack computer. It is made up of 72 individual graphics cards and 36 CPUs. Nvidia's version of Infinity Fabric is called NVLink, and all of the 72 GPUs and 36 CPUs are all connected to one another using NVLink. This is the largest interconnection of its kind, which is the impressive part of the GB200. Nvlink also can connect multiple GB200s together so all of their GPUs can talk with one another. This scale of Nvlink is really the killer app of the GB200, not the chips. In Nvidia's marketing material, it shows metrics for one whole GB200 system and also for one GB200 ""superchip"" which includes 2 GPUs and a CPU. Superchip is intentionally misleading though, because its 3 separate chips on a board (and one is a CPU), not one big chip. 2x GB200 ""superchips"" each with 2 GPUs and 1 CPU B200 The B200 is a single giant GPU. Its probably something like what each of the GPUs on the ""superchips"" are, but we don't know for sure. Either way its a single chip like the MI300X. I'm going to call the GPUs on the superchips B200s for simplicity sake. Nvidia's Long Green Dick Bar Charts I've looked through all of these, and they are all almost completely meaningless other than as trend indicators. They don't tell you even what metrics are being shown other than a two word description. Forget testing methodologies and all the details needed to understand them. I can tell you that the massive NVLink setup in the GB200 is going to lead to huge efficiency and clustering improvements, but on an individual chip basis, there is not as big of a difference between the B200 and the H200 or MI300X other than size. Comparing apples-to-apples The MI300X's specs are plainly available, but nvidia hasn't released all of them for the B200 yet. Nvidia does give us 10 PFLOPs per ""superchip"" of 16 bit floating point with sparsity (this is a common type of number for AI) and AMD gives us 2.61 PFLOPs per card. Remember, the ""superchip"" is actually 3 chips on a board: a CPU and two GPUs. The CPU on the GB200 superchip is probably providing a minuscule amount of FP16 compared to the GPUs, so we can just divide the number by 2 to get 5. So that's the best metric we can get right now: 2.61 AMD vs 5 Nvidia (FP16 PFLOPs w/ sparsity) or 90% more. Memory Bandwidth For LLM inference, or what happens when you type ""tldr this wsb post:"" into chatgpt, memory bandwidth is the most important bottleneck. Nvidia gives us a comparable figure for this: 16 TB/s for 2 GPUs or 8 TB/s per B200. The MI300X has 5.3 TB/s of memory bandwidth, so the B200 is running with 51% more memory bandwidth.

The CPU on the GB200 superchip is probably providing a minuscule amount of FP16 compared to the GPUs, so we can just divide the number by 2 to get 5. So that's the best metric we can get right now: 2.61 AMD vs 5 Nvidia (FP16 PFLOPs w/ sparsity) or 90% more. Memory Bandwidth For LLM inference, or what happens when you type ""tldr this wsb post:"" into chatgpt, memory bandwidth is the most important bottleneck. Nvidia gives us a comparable figure for this: 16 TB/s for 2 GPUs or 8 TB/s per B200. The MI300X has 5.3 TB/s of memory bandwidth, so the B200 is running with 51% more memory bandwidth. Yes its good, but not out of this world The new nvidia chips coming out later this year are a solid generational move and will be great for customers. However there is no magic, and most of their per-chip performance increase from previous nvidia chips is because they are a lot larger. The H100 and H200 are 80B transistors, the MI300X is 153B transistors, and this new B200 is 208B transistors. There is no magic with the new B200 other than it is a lot bigger in terms of transistor count and has slightly smaller more efficient transistors. The real killer app of the B200 is the way it can be combined with hundreds or thousands of other B200s using NVLink. AMD does have Infinity Fabric which connects 8 GPUs, but they haven't done this scale of integration yet. However its a reasonable assumption AMD can scale Infinity Link in the same way, so this isn't putting AMD out of the question for its next generation. Where does the MI300X fit in? Read my other post for more details about the AMD value proposition, but I'll do a quick summary here. Remember that the MI300X is probably currently the leader in performance and will be until the B200 comes out. That gives it 9 months give or take at the top. However, it does not need to remain the leader to sell in a volume that will be a huge increase in revenue and profit for AMD. There are plenty of niches that the MI300X does fill that the B200 doesn't. For instance the MI300X does have over double the 64 bit floating point performance of the B200. 64 bit floats are used in scientific modelling but not in AI. Presumably Nvidia will release another card that competes for general compute performance, but the MI300X does both AI and large scale compute well. Also for smaller deployments that can't leverage NVLink's large scaling efficiencies, the MI300X can easily make sense. The MI300X does have a similar interconnect at 8-card scale with Infinity Fabric. Also its likely companies will pick up the MI300X simply to diversify so Nvidia doesn't have negotiating leverage on them or because they want to reduce supply chain risk. Lastly AMD can always drop the price and still have a huge profit margin. Its easy for me to imagine a 15% AMD AI accelerator market share with the B200 existing for these reasons. Furthermore, none of the additions from the GB200 or B200 are serious moats for Nvidia that AMD can't cross.

I can tell you that the massive NVLink setup in the GB200 is going to lead to huge efficiency and clustering improvements, but on an individual chip basis, there is not as big of a difference between the B200 and the H200 or MI300X other than size. Comparing apples-to-apples The MI300X's specs are plainly available, but nvidia hasn't released all of them for the B200 yet. Nvidia does give us 10 PFLOPs per ""superchip"" of 16 bit floating point with sparsity (this is a common type of number for AI) and AMD gives us 2.61 PFLOPs per card. Remember, the ""superchip"" is actually 3 chips on a board: a CPU and two GPUs. The CPU on the GB200 superchip is probably providing a minuscule amount of FP16 compared to the GPUs, so we can just divide the number by 2 to get 5. So that's the best metric we can get right now: 2.61 AMD vs 5 Nvidia (FP16 PFLOPs w/ sparsity) or 90% more. Memory Bandwidth For LLM inference, or what happens when you type ""tldr this wsb post:"" into chatgpt, memory bandwidth is the most important bottleneck. Nvidia gives us a comparable figure for this: 16 TB/s for 2 GPUs or 8 TB/s per B200. The MI300X has 5.3 TB/s of memory bandwidth, so the B200 is running with 51% more memory bandwidth. Yes its good, but not out of this world The new nvidia chips coming out later this year are a solid generational move and will be great for customers. However there is no magic, and most of their per-chip performance increase from previous nvidia chips is because they are a lot larger. The H100 and H200 are 80B transistors, the MI300X is 153B transistors, and this new B200 is 208B transistors. There is no magic with the new B200 other than it is a lot bigger in terms of transistor count and has slightly smaller more efficient transistors. The real killer app of the B200 is the way it can be combined with hundreds or thousands of other B200s using NVLink. AMD does have Infinity Fabric which connects 8 GPUs, but they haven't done this scale of integration yet. However its a reasonable assumption AMD can scale Infinity Link in the same way, so this isn't putting AMD out of the question for its next generation. Where does the MI300X fit in? Read my other post for more details about the AMD value proposition, but I'll do a quick summary here. Remember that the MI300X is probably currently the leader in performance and will be until the B200 comes out. That gives it 9 months give or take at the top. However, it does not need to remain the leader to sell in a volume that will be a huge increase in revenue and profit for AMD. There are plenty of niches that the MI300X does fill that the B200 doesn't. For instance the MI300X does have over double the 64 bit floating point performance of the B200. 64 bit floats are used in scientific modelling but not in AI. Presumably Nvidia will release another card that competes for general compute performance, but the MI300X does both AI and large scale compute well. Also for smaller deployments that can't leverage NVLink's large scaling efficiencies, the MI300X can easily make sense. The MI300X does have a similar interconnect at 8-card scale with Infinity Fabric. Also its likely companies will pick up the MI300X simply to diversify so Nvidia doesn't have negotiating leverage on them or because they want to reduce supply chain risk. Lastly AMD can always drop the price and still have a huge profit margin. Its easy for me to imagine a 15% AMD AI accelerator market share with the B200 existing for these reasons. Furthermore, none of the additions from the GB200 or B200 are serious moats for Nvidia that AMD can't cross. AMD can scale up its chip transistor counts, add more stacks of HBM, and scale Infinity Link in the same way.

AMD can scale their next chip up if they want more FLOPs and memory bandwidth too. Basically the issues with Nvidia's announcement boil down to 1) not revealing their methodology, 2) doing apples to oranges comparisons, and 3) giving metrics that are intentionally misleading so people watching do apples to oranges comparisons.

MI300X The MI300X is basically like a giant GPU. Up to 8 of them fit in a big computer that goes in a rack in a datacenter. They are connected to the server using PCIE like your graphics card, but are also interconnected with each other using Infinity Fabric cables. Infinity Fabric is important because it allows the cards to bypass the CPU when transferring data from one card to another. AMD's metrics are for one card. GB200 The GB200 is a giant two-rack computer. It is made up of 72 individual graphics cards and 36 CPUs. Nvidia's version of Infinity Fabric is called NVLink, and all of the 72 GPUs and 36 CPUs are all connected to one another using NVLink. This is the largest interconnection of its kind, which is the impressive part of the GB200. Nvlink also can connect multiple GB200s together so all of their GPUs can talk with one another. This scale of Nvlink is really the killer app of the GB200, not the chips. In Nvidia's marketing material, it shows metrics for one whole GB200 system and also for one GB200 ""superchip"" which includes 2 GPUs and a CPU. Superchip is intentionally misleading though, because its 3 separate chips on a board (and one is a CPU), not one big chip. 2x GB200 ""superchips"" each with 2 GPUs and 1 CPU B200 The B200 is a single giant GPU. Its probably something like what each of the GPUs on the ""superchips"" are, but we don't know for sure. Either way its a single chip like the MI300X.

I'm going to call the GPUs on the superchips B200s for simplicity sake. Nvidia's Long Green Dick Bar Charts I've looked through all of these, and they are all almost completely meaningless other than as trend indicators. They don't tell you even what metrics are being shown other than a two word description. Forget testing methodologies and all the details needed to understand them. I can tell you that the massive NVLink setup in the GB200 is going to lead to huge efficiency and clustering improvements, but on an individual chip basis, there is not as big of a difference between the B200 and the H200 or MI300X other than size. Comparing apples-to-apples The MI300X's specs are plainly available, but nvidia hasn't released all of them for the B200 yet. Nvidia does give us 10 PFLOPs per ""superchip"" of 16 bit floating point with sparsity (this is a common type of number for AI) and AMD gives us 2.61 PFLOPs per card. Remember, the ""superchip"" is actually 3 chips on a board: a CPU and two GPUs. The CPU on the GB200 superchip is probably providing a minuscule amount of FP16 compared to the GPUs, so we can just divide the number by 2 to get 5. So that's the best metric we can get right now: 2.61 AMD vs 5 Nvidia (FP16 PFLOPs w/ sparsity) or 90% more. Memory Bandwidth For LLM inference, or what happens when you type ""tldr this wsb post:"" into chatgpt, memory bandwidth is the most important bottleneck. Nvidia gives us a comparable figure for this: 16 TB/s for 2 GPUs or 8 TB/s per B200. The MI300X has 5.3 TB/s of memory bandwidth, so the B200 is running with 51% more memory bandwidth. Yes its good, but not out of this world The new nvidia chips coming out later this year are a solid generational move and will be great for customers. However there is no magic, and most of their per-chip performance increase from previous nvidia chips is because they are a lot larger. The H100 and H200 are 80B transistors, the MI300X is 153B transistors, and this new B200 is 208B transistors. There is no magic with the new B200 other than it is a lot bigger in terms of transistor count and has slightly smaller more efficient transistors. The real killer app of the B200 is the way it can be combined with hundreds or thousands of other B200s using NVLink. AMD does have Infinity Fabric which connects 8 GPUs, but they haven't done this scale of integration yet. However its a reasonable assumption AMD can scale Infinity Link in the same way, so this isn't putting AMD out of the question for its next generation. Where does the MI300X fit in? Read my other post for more details about the AMD value proposition, but I'll do a quick summary here. Remember that the MI300X is probably currently the leader in performance and will be until the B200 comes out. That gives it 9 months give or take at the top. However, it does not need to remain the leader to sell in a volume that will be a huge increase in revenue and profit for AMD. There are plenty of niches that the MI300X does fill that the B200 doesn't. For instance the MI300X does have over double the 64 bit floating point performance of the B200. 64 bit floats are used in scientific modelling but not in AI. Presumably Nvidia will release another card that competes for general compute performance, but the MI300X does both AI and large scale compute well. Also for smaller deployments that can't leverage NVLink's large scaling efficiencies, the MI300X can easily make sense. The MI300X does have a similar interconnect at 8-card scale with Infinity Fabric. Also its likely companies will pick up the MI300X simply to diversify so Nvidia doesn't have negotiating leverage on them or because they want to reduce supply chain risk.

Infinity Fabric is important because it allows the cards to bypass the CPU when transferring data from one card to another. AMD's metrics are for one card. GB200 The GB200 is a giant two-rack computer. It is made up of 72 individual graphics cards and 36 CPUs. Nvidia's version of Infinity Fabric is called NVLink, and all of the 72 GPUs and 36 CPUs are all connected to one another using NVLink. This is the largest interconnection of its kind, which is the impressive part of the GB200. Nvlink also can connect multiple GB200s together so all of their GPUs can talk with one another.

Infinity Fabric is important because it allows the cards to bypass the CPU when transferring data from one card to another. AMD's metrics are for one card. GB200 The GB200 is a giant two-rack computer. It is made up of 72 individual graphics cards and 36 CPUs. Nvidia's version of Infinity Fabric is called NVLink, and all of the 72 GPUs and 36 CPUs are all connected to one another using NVLink. This is the largest interconnection of its kind, which is the impressive part of the GB200. Nvlink also can connect multiple GB200s together so all of their GPUs can talk with one another. This scale of Nvlink is really the killer app of the GB200, not the chips. In Nvidia's marketing material, it shows metrics for one whole GB200 system and also for one GB200 ""superchip"" which includes 2 GPUs and a CPU. Superchip is intentionally misleading though, because its 3 separate chips on a board (and one is a CPU), not one big chip. 2x GB200 ""superchips"" each with 2 GPUs and 1 CPU B200 The B200 is a single giant GPU. Its probably something like what each of the GPUs on the ""superchips"" are, but we don't know for sure. Either way its a single chip like the MI300X. I'm going to call the GPUs on the superchips B200s for simplicity sake. Nvidia's Long Green Dick Bar Charts I've looked through all of these, and they are all almost completely meaningless other than as trend indicators. They don't tell you even what metrics are being shown other than a two word description. Forget testing methodologies and all the details needed to understand them. I can tell you that the massive NVLink setup in the GB200 is going to lead to huge efficiency and clustering improvements, but on an individual chip basis, there is not as big of a difference between the B200 and the H200 or MI300X other than size. Comparing apples-to-apples The MI300X's specs are plainly available, but nvidia hasn't released all of them for the B200 yet. Nvidia does give us 10 PFLOPs per ""superchip"" of 16 bit floating point with sparsity (this is a common type of number for AI) and AMD gives us 2.61 PFLOPs per card. Remember, the ""superchip"" is actually 3 chips on a board: a CPU and two GPUs. The CPU on the GB200 superchip is probably providing a minuscule amount of FP16 compared to the GPUs, so we can just divide the number by 2 to get 5. So that's the best metric we can get right now: 2.61 AMD vs 5 Nvidia (FP16 PFLOPs w/ sparsity) or 90% more. Memory Bandwidth For LLM inference, or what happens when you type ""tldr this wsb post:"" into chatgpt, memory bandwidth is the most important bottleneck. Nvidia gives us a comparable figure for this: 16 TB/s for 2 GPUs or 8 TB/s per B200. The MI300X has 5.3 TB/s of memory bandwidth, so the B200 is running with 51% more memory bandwidth. Yes its good, but not out of this world The new nvidia chips coming out later this year are a solid generational move and will be great for customers. However there is no magic, and most of their per-chip performance increase from previous nvidia chips is because they are a lot larger. The H100 and H200 are 80B transistors, the MI300X is 153B transistors, and this new B200 is 208B transistors. There is no magic with the new B200 other than it is a lot bigger in terms of transistor count and has slightly smaller more efficient transistors. The real killer app of the B200 is the way it can be combined with hundreds or thousands of other B200s using NVLink. AMD does have Infinity Fabric which connects 8 GPUs, but they haven't done this scale of integration yet. However its a reasonable assumption AMD can scale Infinity Link in the same way, so this isn't putting AMD out of the question for its next generation. Where does the MI300X fit in? Read my other post for more details about the AMD value proposition, but I'll do a quick summary here. Remember that the MI300X is probably currently the leader in performance and will be until the B200 comes out. That gives it 9 months give or take at the top. However, it does not need to remain the leader to sell in a volume that will be a huge increase in revenue and profit for AMD. There are plenty of niches that the MI300X does fill that the B200 doesn't. For instance the MI300X does have over double the 64 bit floating point performance of the B200. 64 bit floats are used in scientific modelling but not in AI. Presumably Nvidia will release another card that competes for general compute performance, but the MI300X does both AI and large scale compute well. Also for smaller deployments that can't leverage NVLink's large scaling efficiencies, the MI300X can easily make sense. The MI300X does have a similar interconnect at 8-card scale with Infinity Fabric. Also its likely companies will pick up the MI300X simply to diversify so Nvidia doesn't have negotiating leverage on them or because they want to reduce supply chain risk. Lastly AMD can always drop the price and still have a huge profit margin. Its easy for me to imagine a 15% AMD AI accelerator market share with the B200 existing for these reasons. Furthermore, none of the additions from the GB200 or B200 are serious moats for Nvidia that AMD can't cross. AMD can scale up its chip transistor counts, add more stacks of HBM, and scale Infinity Link in the same way. The GB200 is great, but it does not represent a hurdle AMD can't cross.","Agreed, law not the best word (it's just the popular phrase to describe the math), good with theorem, effect, whatever. It just seems it will hit a point of diminishing returns at some point but is currently in early stage hockey stick uptrend.I just heard about Cerebras in an article from Barron's earlier this week.
