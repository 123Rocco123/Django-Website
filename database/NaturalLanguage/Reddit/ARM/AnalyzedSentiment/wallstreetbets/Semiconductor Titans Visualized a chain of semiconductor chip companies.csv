Semiconductor Titans Visualized","equipment manufactures part is very simplified, there are so many more equipment and material venders in between, a lot of them are base in Taiwan so regards here won't have access tho.For example, the Quartz Furnace tube manufacture TSC(5434.TW) stonk went up after earthquake cause tube are known to break easily, then you have ASE(3711.TW | NYSE: ASX) that provide advanced packaging services that support TSMC's CoWoS, or you have ASC(4770.TW) that provide chemical supplies, or Acter Technology(5536.TW) that help build massive clean rooms for TSMC, Kinik(1560.TW) here selling sci-fi sand papers that polish the wafers",0,0.526,0.999,NEGATIVE
