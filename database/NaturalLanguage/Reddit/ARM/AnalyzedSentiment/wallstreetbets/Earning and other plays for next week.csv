There are a lot of earnings next week, and my positions are as follow: SAVE - 20x 5/10 3.5c@0.39(Earnings 5/6 premarket) HIMS - 10x 5/10 12.5c@0.8, 10x 5/10 13.5c@0.5 (Earnings 5/6 AH) PLTR - 5x 5/10 22.5c@1.8 (Earning 5/6 AH) HOOD - 5x 5/10 17c@1.37, 5x 5/10 17.5c@0.9 (Earnings 5/8 AH) Actually wondering if I should roll over my HOOD calls to 8/16 20c, and my PLTR calls to 7/19 24c (in case stock doesnt go tits up after earnings and my calls dont gain much or even lose money) Also have ARM strangle, SOUN calls, MCHP calls and U calls in my watchlist, might add them as well for earnings. Other calls: ALCC - 10x 5/17 12.5c@2.9 (Sam Altman my GOAT, hoping for a big pop after the merger announcement) IBRX - 10x 6/21 10c@1.42 (Good squeeze potential, great fundamentals and deals, earnings also coming up on 5/9) RILY - 10x 5/17 35c@2.2 (Again, great squeeze potential and earnings coming up 5/14 will be interesting how it plays out) What do you guys think, will these calls print? What are your guys positions for next week?",Yea I feel like gambling cuz I feel like it’s very over bought lol,4,0.502,0.998,NEGATIVE
