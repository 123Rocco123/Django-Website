Now, with the AI boom, the performance of CPUs is much less important - it basically just exists to manage the GPUs hooked up to it.If you're looking to build a new AI training cluster/farm, do you buy expensive, power hungry Intel CPUs for 2% more performance you don't need? Or do you buy the cheap ARM chip that eats a quarter of the power and supplies 98% of the performance?Note that this hasn't happened yet, and ARM looks great even without any AI.
