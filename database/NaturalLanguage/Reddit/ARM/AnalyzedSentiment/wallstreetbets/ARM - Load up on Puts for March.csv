The best for put options would be a race to the bottom, SoftBank would like to offload the full 90% at the highest price. However selling even 10% would cause a massive drop given the liquidity is very thin with only 10% float.So they would probably offload 10% take the hit and wait for the stock to recover again and sell another 10%sell them off market for a discount to another bank or fund. This would be the best so they don’t cause a massive drop. However the buying fund and bank would need to hedge this massive amount of shares and not sure how that will go.sell them to multiple banks and funds, this would be the best but it will cause a Holdout Problem. Meaning that one buyer can ruin the deal by underbidding so we again get the race to the bottom.Anyway, I can imagine SoftBank being smart enough to offload the shares at a decent price and not tank the market.
