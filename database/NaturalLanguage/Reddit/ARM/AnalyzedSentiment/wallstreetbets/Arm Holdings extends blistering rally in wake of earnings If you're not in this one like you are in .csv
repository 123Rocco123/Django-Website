,,"Eh, it happens. Once you get down near where you started, I guess that is a safe time to bail. But some people like to do it like they are playing roulette and just let it ride.I read an article that if you started with $1000 in INTC 20 years ago, you would have $2400 today. An annualized return of 4.4%. An index fund would have beat that rate of return. https://stocks.apple.com/A5Bk-TRrrR8aHt_tI53TnDwI guess it matters what stock you pick.

,,"ARM is in NVIDIA, Samsung, Apple, Tesla, Ford F-150s, and more. These other companies pay licensing fees for ARMâ€™s designs to work with their chips. I have a feeling it will go even higher in the next couple of years with AI, EV sales and consumer electronics always selling. It may not look like it, but windows like this may look over priced, but itâ€™s going to go up due to everything that they are in. Soft Bank may end up selling a little to dilute the number of shares and the price may come down after their 6 month window since the IPO expires, and that would be the time to snatch up some of it in March.Hereâ€™s a video of their CEO talking about the majority of the products that they are a part of: https://www.msn.com/en-us/video/money/arm-ceo-on-earnings-outlook-ai-nvidia-as-partner/vi-BB1hZmem?ocid=socialshare",1,0.54,0.905,NEGATIVE
