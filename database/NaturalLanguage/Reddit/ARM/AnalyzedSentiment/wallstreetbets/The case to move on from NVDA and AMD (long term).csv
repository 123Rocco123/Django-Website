,"There are times when I read about GPU makers here and I'm wondering if any of you have ever tried renting GPU by the hour or week or month for AI purposes in the past 2 years? If so have you ever calculated how much you're being charged per FLOP or in general the direction of the price of raw compute? As AI becomes mainstream and inference demand grows, what do you think happens to the basic laws of supply and demand? I was in the data center business (aka HPC) until end of last year and I can tell you that pricing for Nvidia A100 rental had compressed by 70% over the last 2 years. The only reason you're seeing all these great GPU sales is because of 2 things: AI compute demand exploded, and greedy mofo distributors have been hording GPUs - yeah you heard me. I used to sell container loads of servers equipped with various GPUs like the A100, and then H100 purchased from the spot market (we do not have the volume to deal with Nvidia directly), and I've seen warehouses full of these GPUs sitting there waiting for the highest bidder. The only way Nvidia (or AMD for that matter) distributors get their discounts and priority is by placing huge orders. While you hear about big news of TSLA or AMZN buying a few billions worth of GPUs from NVDA, significant chunk of their GPU business is distributed by companies you've never heard of and made into complete systems via companies like SMCI. If you own the supply and you restrict the supply on the street, what will happen to the price on the street? There's a warehouse in Yokohama that I've been to that was floor to ceiling in tens of thousands of boxes of GPUs, waiting for the highest bidder. Smuggling is also hugely profitable, not that my company ever did that, but we did have a ball selling overpriced A100s to Saudi Arabia before that was banned by the State Dept. However, the story goes that there's a vibrant and profitable smuggling business between Taiwan and China (where the most advanced GPUs are banned) via the Kinmen Islands which is only a few miles away from mainland China. Google Kinmen and you'll see there's been this brouhaha over 2 dead ""fishermen"" from the TWCG chasing and then hitting the ""fishing boat"" (that has FOUR huge outboard engines made for speed) and causing the boat to capsize and killing 2 of 4 ""fishermen"". Coincidence that none of the TWCG law enforcement personnel had their bodycams turned on, and rumor goes that TWCG is actually the biggest smuggler of them all. Why not? A few boxes here and there ""fall off the truck"" by TSM's loading dock and gets picked up by a non-descript van. Anyone ever looked at NVDA sales volume in Taiwan vs. its meager population? Yes they export a lot of that in the form of finished systems, but even the State Dept can't keep track of everything - there are plenty of ways to fudge the numbers, including TSM yield rates on ""defective"" GPUs. While TSLA, GOOG, MSFT, AMZN, META can all get their hands on the high end GPUs directly at great discounts, why do you think they also invest heavily in their own AI chip development using RISC-V or ARM? Why do you think companies like Tenstorrent has gotten so much press over the past 12 months around their open RISC-V ecosystem designed for general AI and compute? Ah but what do I know, I'm just a permabear regard (according to some) and I have no idea when this Jenga game will end. Enjoy the moonshot while it lasts, and congrats to all who profited hugely on NVDA, DELL, and SMCI the last few weeks.

But i will say that the demand right now is so crazy it might not be affected by the artificial supply constraint by these distributors. Hell even the general compute infrastructure for fortune 500 companies is still being fleshed out plus all maturation of the various models being deployed. There is a lot of bullshit but there is also s lot of value out there too. I dont think the jenga tower is gonna fall anytime soon. At least until the money has been spent trying to bring AI to all these companies and then they realize they just traded salary and benefit expenses for compute bills and specialized engineers.,0,0.526,0.967,NEGATIVE

These companies will buy and buy and buy until they are satisfied... and then the price will pop maybe 30-50%The counter argument is they will always have to constantly upgrade their specs etc every set amount of years because tech keeps advancing - which is the bull case long term for NVDA,2,0.544,0.653,POSITIVE
