,"The recent judgement amounted to less than 2.5% of Apples current cash flow. The Chinese are fucking broke, Apple would've lost money there if Tim Apple had directly jerked off Xi himself. Their economy is collapsing, their market is collapsing, their real estate market is collapsing. No shit they are losing money there, the Chinese need to eat, not buy iPhones. Apple was one of the original fucking chip designers for AI. Since A11 in 2017, they built their own Neural Engine (ANE) and they include compute units in their current M chips that make them some of the most power efficient chips available for AI. Has Apple ever released anything that wasn't the best version of it's existing product space? iPhone - ground breaking at release. iPad - stupid at launch and now you give one to all of your shit head kids I am sure. MacBook - Apple literally just dunked on all of their competition with one generation of MacBooks by just returning to form and it has been praised by even the worst Apple haters. Chips - AI has been in the iPhone for nearly 10 fuckin years now you nonces and their ARM implementation is god tier. You know why your iPhone isn't dead when you want to jerk off on your lunch break? Apple saw ARM 50 miles away and switched before everyone. Same with the M lineup, literally leagues ahead of their competitors on the FIRST GEN LAUNCH. Guess what - probably also AI!!! WOW! Releasing a finished product at launch? Unheard of!! I know you guys just buy every piece of shit unfinished COD that gets released so I am sure that's how your pea brains seem to think this works. AI will come from Apple when it is ready, no sooner, no later. The pay a sick dividend and that hasn't gone away. The continue to dunk on earnings and people still sell the stock because idk, they're expecting ""iPhone 20 with new built in AI Dynamic Dildo machine that flys you to a private island""!!! Apple is a growth company that is not going away, you will still buy the same dumb fucking Apple Watch every year and you know it. So shut the flyin fadoodle up, I am sick of reading ""aPpLe MaKe No Ai!!!"" It's coming you morons, I want them to nail it out of the park because that's what buyers expect and want out of Apple. It feels like their stock is disconnected from reality when Apple continues to blow your minds with the same basic ass shit while you sell their stock from your iPhone every single year.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,0.999,NEGATIVE

You know why your iPhone isn't dead when you want to jerk off on your lunch break? Apple saw ARM 50 miles away and switched before everyone. Same with the M lineup, literally leagues ahead of their competitors on the FIRST GEN LAUNCH. Guess what - probably also AI!!! WOW! Releasing a finished product at launch? Unheard of!! I know you guys just buy every piece of shit unfinished COD that gets released so I am sure that's how your pea brains seem to think this works. AI will come from Apple when it is ready, no sooner, no later. The pay a sick dividend and that hasn't gone away. The continue to dunk on earnings and people still sell the stock because idk, they're expecting ""iPhone 20 with new built in AI Dynamic Dildo machine that flys you to a private island""!!! Apple is a growth company that is not going away, you will still buy the same dumb fucking Apple Watch every year and you know it. So shut the flyin fadoodle up, I am sick of reading ""aPpLe MaKe No Ai!!!"" It's coming you morons, I want them to nail it out of the park because that's what buyers expect and want out of Apple. It feels like their stock is disconnected from reality when Apple continues to blow your minds with the same basic ass shit while you sell their stock from your iPhone every single year.",Agree.

,"The recent judgement amounted to less than 2.5% of Apples current cash flow. The Chinese are fucking broke, Apple would've lost money there if Tim Apple had directly jerked off Xi himself. Their economy is collapsing, their market is collapsing, their real estate market is collapsing. No shit they are losing money there, the Chinese need to eat, not buy iPhones. Apple was one of the original fucking chip designers for AI. Since A11 in 2017, they built their own Neural Engine (ANE) and they include compute units in their current M chips that make them some of the most power efficient chips available for AI. Has Apple ever released anything that wasn't the best version of it's existing product space? iPhone - ground breaking at release. iPad - stupid at launch and now you give one to all of your shit head kids I am sure. MacBook - Apple literally just dunked on all of their competition with one generation of MacBooks by just returning to form and it has been praised by even the worst Apple haters. Chips - AI has been in the iPhone for nearly 10 fuckin years now you nonces and their ARM implementation is god tier.
