,"Let's say Nvidia goes down after earnings. Obviously best time to buy calls at that point, but would a drop in Nvidia price affect other semiconductors or AI stocks like AMD, TSM, SMCI, ARM or anything related?","It's not going to tank - even if the earnings disappoint - they will take it upto 1000-1100 for the split... NVidia is in heavy holdings and the speculator is only helping the price... It might do a correctivs dip to knock out weak holders but will then continue it's march to the moon... Thing is there is no other bubble to funnel the money towards? What are they going to do? Make the REITS rocket? Costco, Walmart rocket? What other place is there to absorb such heavy cash that is fundamentally sound for mid - long run? Look for that first...until then tech is it, maybe even other discounted associated tech will absorb the trailing funds because moving forward the ROI appeal of NVDA is diminishing, but will then reset after the split to return 5-10x",0,0.518,1.0,NEGATIVE

Obviously best time to buy calls at that point, but would a drop in Nvidia price affect other semiconductors or AI stocks like AMD, TSM, SMCI, ARM or anything related?","Intel is looking like it is fueling up for an ARM style rocket, I see little reason for it to not be trading at 400 considering the amount of capital expenditure now coming to fruition and getting ideally posirioned to take advantage of orrders from NVidia, Microsoft (which should be looking into hardware game soon enough - handhelds, vrs, wearables, mobile phones, foldables etc.), and other home appliances manufacturers...while TSMC is busy with concentrated digital market, Intel is positioned to take over orders from that market and the tangible goods market which should all be evolving to the next gen smart appliances and household goods - an opinion - something about the extreme downplay of INTC reaks of ARM style downplay to me... One of these days we might wake up to see INTC take off harder and faster than ARM! I am in! ",2,0.527,0.93,POSITIVE

Obviously best time to buy calls at that point, but would a drop in Nvidia price affect other semiconductors or AI stocks like AMD, TSM, SMCI, ARM or anything related?","I have followed Intel for a long time. I have never owned any. They always seem to disappoint. They are not an innovative company. They've survived on sales to PC makers and the military. They are at $44 right now, and you think they should be $400. That is not going to happen for a while, if ever.",3,0.578,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"Let's say Nvidia goes down after earnings. Obviously best time to buy calls at that point, but would a drop in Nvidia price affect other semiconductors or AI stocks like AMD, TSM, SMCI, ARM or anything related?","I understand where you're coming from, even the post covid tech rally intel was the only ticker to disappoint by a huge margin... But historically they have been superior to AMD...and have always maintained that superiority...they were undergoing a massive capacity expansion a few phases of which are now live, more ground breaking happening in Germany and EU. And while we will never know the finer details of what makes a stock soar till it is in ""after the fact"" phase, I am of the opinion if it is ever going to payout, it is going to be this chip rally season when we will probably hear some surprise announcement about the application of it's foundary services...it's decently priced to park 10-15% of portfolio in but I am keeping it at 40% at least till NVDA reports, if INTC clicks then I will continue to hold...",4,0.53,0.976,NEGATIVE

In an event that NVDA pulls an AMDâ€™s earning where they did meet expectations, but investors are selling it would most likely the market would normalize, and not tank. Maybe all other semi-conductors would fall with it as well. It wouldnâ€™t be a significant pull back. Hopefully, everyone starts to switch over to AMD as the new NVDA lol",0,0.548,0.996,NEGATIVE
