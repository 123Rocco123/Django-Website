,"TLDR at the top. Chicago Bears case: General market uncertainty. SPY facing resistance Geopolitical threats in the form of Chinese aggression to Taiwan and sanctions from US Chicago Bulls case: Most explosive growth of any company, growing revenue and profit almost 20% Q/Q over the past year Strong future demand, first to market advantage with no immediate threats The chart and timing of May 22nd earnings. Shorts can’t help themselves trying to call crash My positions: Jan2025 1000c May 24 950c The bear case is self explanatory so I will not go into much detail. We are coming to the end of a massive QE cycle and almost everyone has lost spending power. Money is tight which risks a broad market sell off. I will look for more bank failures home and abroad to signal a short term dump. A significant threat from China would shake everything TSM touches. Right now we see posturing from the CCP and the occasional show of aggression when the politics call for it, but no signs of imminent invasion yet. The bull case is simply bulletproof. Breaking down the above points below: The earnings are in. AMD revenue has been flat for 3-4 years and they are supposed to compete with NVDA? They are not in the same league - no one is. NVDA is the only mega cap stock putting up these kind of numbers. Speculation is a bull’s best friend, and the trajectory is unparalleled with this stock. Cryptocurrency mining is not going anywhere, and it just got more expensive to mine after the latest round of BTC halving. More computing power = more revenue for miners and this market competition will intensify. NVDA price seems to correlate with BTC but the crypto mining revenue stream is consistent. The other revenue stream is of course AI applications in which an arms race is taking place. The psychology of us ‘investors’ is mostly really stupid, but the buzz matters. This is the only company anyone is excited about. Market makers know this and they know they can fetch a high price when earnings rolls around. The chart is set up for new heights with the dip bought within a week. I plan on holding my jan2025c through earnings. NVDA for the past year has beat the seemingly aggressive expectations it sets for itself. They say 24B revenue this quarter but I think closer to 27B. Let the speculation begin. It will be interesting to see if we get another dip before a significant event like last earnings feb 2024 and GTC meeting March 18. If so, I buy more. Good luck everyone!

,"TLDR at the top. Chicago Bears case: General market uncertainty. SPY facing resistance Geopolitical threats in the form of Chinese aggression to Taiwan and sanctions from US Chicago Bulls case: Most explosive growth of any company, growing revenue and profit almost 20% Q/Q over the past year Strong future demand, first to market advantage with no immediate threats The chart and timing of May 22nd earnings. Shorts can’t help themselves trying to call crash My positions: Jan2025 1000c May 24 950c The bear case is self explanatory so I will not go into much detail. We are coming to the end of a massive QE cycle and almost everyone has lost spending power. Money is tight which risks a broad market sell off. I will look for more bank failures home and abroad to signal a short term dump. A significant threat from China would shake everything TSM touches. Right now we see posturing from the CCP and the occasional show of aggression when the politics call for it, but no signs of imminent invasion yet. The bull case is simply bulletproof. Breaking down the above points below: The earnings are in. AMD revenue has been flat for 3-4 years and they are supposed to compete with NVDA? They are not in the same league - no one is. NVDA is the only mega cap stock putting up these kind of numbers. Speculation is a bull’s best friend, and the trajectory is unparalleled with this stock. Cryptocurrency mining is not going anywhere, and it just got more expensive to mine after the latest round of BTC halving. More computing power = more revenue for miners and this market competition will intensify. NVDA price seems to correlate with BTC but the crypto mining revenue stream is consistent. The other revenue stream is of course AI applications in which an arms race is taking place. The psychology of us ‘investors’ is mostly really stupid, but the buzz matters. This is the only company anyone is excited about. Market makers know this and they know they can fetch a high price when earnings rolls around. The chart is set up for new heights with the dip bought within a week. I plan on holding my jan2025c through earnings.
