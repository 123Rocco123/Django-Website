,"After depositing $15k, I set a goal to invest in ‘value stocks’ and grow my portfolio by 20% annually, managing it myself by picking individual stocks. I started by buying 10 stocks, including Celsius, Tesla, Arm, Ferrari, and others. My portfolio grew to $18k. From there, it fluctuated, and at the time, I knew nothing about options. Eventually, I decided to throw it all into one name when I saw its price spiking. My account hit $30k for the first time. However, I still hadn’t learned to take profits and was stuck in a scarcity mindset, feeling like I had to ride every trade ‘to the max.’ 🤦 After watching my portfolio tank back to $12k, I started revenge trading to recover losses but ended up nearly losing everything. That experience pushed me to learn about options, including the Greeks, implied volatility, and moneyness. I then switched strategies, deciding to buy longer-dated options (LEAPS) with strikes that were somewhat ITM. I focused on companies that were ‘promising’ for the near to long term and had been beaten down. Instead of buying high and selling low, I started buying stocks at cheaper prices and simply waiting. Over time, my account began growing steadily as I stuck to my strategy and waited for my take-profit targets to be hit. I traded into hyped small-caps before eventually selling all my positions to go all-in on quantum. Now, I’m holding cash after finally taking profits for the first time.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

That's the kind of thing I'm looking for and lately been messing with finviz filters to find them. But idk what I'm doing. I believe in leaps but I can't just do leaps on spy since the economy is about to be shaken up quite a bit.,0,0.541,POSITIVE,0.706
