They are going to be this way until the Terminator spawns from another future time and tries to find John Connor. At that point, when Arnold spawns naked in a factory backdrop with molten steel spraying sparks of fire on his glorious liquid metal exoskeleton, then and only then, will the bears realize what AI is and can be used for.

A Google search query uses 10x less energy than a GPT query Here is the thing. When I GPT something I don't need to browse 100 websites to get one answer. Has anyone thought of that? I bet if you redid the study and actually included the practicality of asking something and getting a direct answer they would tell you that is a large cost savings.
