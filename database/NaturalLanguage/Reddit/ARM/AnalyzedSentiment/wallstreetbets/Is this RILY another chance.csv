,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates. July/later calls / shares may be nice risk/reward entered post earnings on 2/29 (so entry next week or so). Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank? It‚Äôs not like its readers have that much interest in these tiny-cap companies. They generally read about the big boys. WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing? SOROS, Group One, Susquehana, HAP Trading are short, along with our old friend Citadel Also, here‚Äôs a list of Bulls and Bears on social media. The Bulls are harder to find: Twitter Bears: Learn the counterpoints u/AlderLaneEggs u/aureliusvalue u/friendlybearsa u/wolfpackresearch u/froggyspence u/billabbatejr Twitter Bulls: https://twitter.com/determinanted https://twitter.com/Brinkswealth10 Fundamentals Who am I kidding, y‚Äôall care? TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates. July/later calls / shares may be nice risk/reward entered post earnings on 2/29 (so entry next week or so). Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank? It‚Äôs not like its readers have that much interest in these tiny-cap companies. They generally read about the big boys. WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing? SOROS, Group One, Susquehana, HAP Trading are short, along with our old friend Citadel Also, here‚Äôs a list of Bulls and Bears on social media. The Bulls are harder to find: Twitter Bears: Learn the counterpoints u/AlderLaneEggs u/aureliusvalue u/friendlybearsa u/wolfpackresearch u/froggyspence u/billabbatejr Twitter Bulls: https://twitter.com/determinanted https://twitter.com/Brinkswealth10 Fundamentals Who am I kidding, y‚Äôall care? TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it.

Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates. July/later calls / shares may be nice risk/reward entered post earnings on 2/29 (so entry next week or so). Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank? It‚Äôs not like its readers have that much interest in these tiny-cap companies. They generally read about the big boys. WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing?

TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation.

TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates. July/later calls / shares may be nice risk/reward entered post earnings on 2/29 (so entry next week or so). Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position.

Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank? It‚Äôs not like its readers have that much interest in these tiny-cap companies. They generally read about the big boys. WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing? SOROS, Group One, Susquehana, HAP Trading are short, along with our old friend Citadel Also, here‚Äôs a list of Bulls and Bears on social media. The Bulls are harder to find: Twitter Bears: Learn the counterpoints u/AlderLaneEggs u/aureliusvalue u/friendlybearsa u/wolfpackresearch u/froggyspence u/billabbatejr Twitter Bulls: https://twitter.com/determinanted https://twitter.com/Brinkswealth10 Fundamentals Who am I kidding, y‚Äôall care? TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates.

Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates. July/later calls / shares may be nice risk/reward entered post earnings on 2/29 (so entry next week or so). Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank? It‚Äôs not like its readers have that much interest in these tiny-cap companies. They generally read about the big boys. WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing? SOROS, Group One, Susquehana, HAP Trading are short, along with our old friend Citadel Also, here‚Äôs a list of Bulls and Bears on social media. The Bulls are harder to find: Twitter Bears: Learn the counterpoints u/AlderLaneEggs u/aureliusvalue u/friendlybearsa u/wolfpackresearch u/froggyspence u/billabbatejr Twitter Bulls: https://twitter.com/determinanted https://twitter.com/Brinkswealth10 Fundamentals Who am I kidding, y‚Äôall care? TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it.

Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong.

Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank? It‚Äôs not like its readers have that much interest in these tiny-cap companies. They generally read about the big boys. WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing?

TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes.

WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing?

TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates. July/later calls / shares may be nice risk/reward entered post earnings on 2/29 (so entry next week or so). Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action.

TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates. July/later calls / shares may be nice risk/reward entered post earnings on 2/29 (so entry next week or so). Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank? It‚Äôs not like its readers have that much interest in these tiny-cap companies. They generally read about the big boys. WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing? SOROS, Group One, Susquehana, HAP Trading are short, along with our old friend Citadel Also, here‚Äôs a list of Bulls and Bears on social media. The Bulls are harder to find: Twitter Bears: Learn the counterpoints u/AlderLaneEggs u/aureliusvalue u/friendlybearsa u/wolfpackresearch u/froggyspence u/billabbatejr Twitter Bulls: https://twitter.com/determinanted https://twitter.com/Brinkswealth10 Fundamentals Who am I kidding, y‚Äôall care? TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research. Make your own conclusions! This ticker is not discussed enough given how interesting and asymmetric the opportunity is.","Yeah, have to respect the opposing views - it's much harder to short than to go long, and he's got a decent track record. Shorting in Nov was great... shorting now, though, not so much imo, but we'll see. The asymmetric risk is very much to the upside imo. I think on the downside if $15 breaks significantly people are hoping for a margin call against Riley's shares lent to AXOS which were probably collateralized around $15-$17.I have a suspicion that the large risk reversal - if not a short protecting an exit - is potentially a buyback-related trade to protect against sub $15 given the impact on the margin loan.It'd be great if during this earnings call they updated on the status of that loan as it's material to the equity price at this point.",1,0.512,0.984,NEGATIVE

Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates. July/later calls / shares may be nice risk/reward entered post earnings on 2/29 (so entry next week or so). Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank?

The Bulls are harder to find: Twitter Bears: Learn the counterpoints u/AlderLaneEggs u/aureliusvalue u/friendlybearsa u/wolfpackresearch u/froggyspence u/billabbatejr Twitter Bulls: https://twitter.com/determinanted https://twitter.com/Brinkswealth10 Fundamentals Who am I kidding, y‚Äôall care? TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it.

Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates. July/later calls / shares may be nice risk/reward entered post earnings on 2/29 (so entry next week or so). Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank? It‚Äôs not like its readers have that much interest in these tiny-cap companies. They generally read about the big boys. WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing?

The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank? It‚Äôs not like its readers have that much interest in these tiny-cap companies. They generally read about the big boys. WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing? SOROS, Group One, Susquehana, HAP Trading are short, along with our old friend Citadel Also, here‚Äôs a list of Bulls and Bears on social media. The Bulls are harder to find: Twitter Bears: Learn the counterpoints u/AlderLaneEggs u/aureliusvalue u/friendlybearsa u/wolfpackresearch u/froggyspence u/billabbatejr Twitter Bulls: https://twitter.com/determinanted https://twitter.com/Brinkswealth10 Fundamentals Who am I kidding, y‚Äôall care? TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates. July/later calls / shares may be nice risk/reward entered post earnings on 2/29 (so entry next week or so). Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years.

If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates. July/later calls / shares may be nice risk/reward entered post earnings on 2/29 (so entry next week or so). Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank? It‚Äôs not like its readers have that much interest in these tiny-cap companies. They generally read about the big boys. WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing? SOROS, Group One, Susquehana, HAP Trading are short, along with our old friend Citadel Also, here‚Äôs a list of Bulls and Bears on social media. The Bulls are harder to find: Twitter Bears: Learn the counterpoints u/AlderLaneEggs u/aureliusvalue u/friendlybearsa u/wolfpackresearch u/froggyspence u/billabbatejr Twitter Bulls: https://twitter.com/determinanted https://twitter.com/Brinkswealth10 Fundamentals Who am I kidding, y‚Äôall care? TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates. July/later calls / shares may be nice risk/reward entered post earnings on 2/29 (so entry next week or so). Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank? It‚Äôs not like its readers have that much interest in these tiny-cap companies. They generally read about the big boys. WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing? SOROS, Group One, Susquehana, HAP Trading are short, along with our old friend Citadel Also, here‚Äôs a list of Bulls and Bears on social media. The Bulls are harder to find: Twitter Bears: Learn the counterpoints u/AlderLaneEggs u/aureliusvalue u/friendlybearsa u/wolfpackresearch u/froggyspence u/billabbatejr Twitter Bulls: https://twitter.com/determinanted https://twitter.com/Brinkswealth10 Fundamentals Who am I kidding, y‚Äôall care? TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023.

I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped.

Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates. July/later calls / shares may be nice risk/reward entered post earnings on 2/29 (so entry next week or so). Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank? It‚Äôs not like its readers have that much interest in these tiny-cap companies. They generally read about the big boys. WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing?

The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank? It‚Äôs not like its readers have that much interest in these tiny-cap companies. They generally read about the big boys. WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing? SOROS, Group One, Susquehana, HAP Trading are short, along with our old friend Citadel Also, here‚Äôs a list of Bulls and Bears on social media. The Bulls are harder to find: Twitter Bears: Learn the counterpoints u/AlderLaneEggs u/aureliusvalue u/friendlybearsa u/wolfpackresearch u/froggyspence u/billabbatejr Twitter Bulls: https://twitter.com/determinanted https://twitter.com/Brinkswealth10 Fundamentals Who am I kidding, y‚Äôall care? TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research. Make your own conclusions! This ticker is not discussed enough given how interesting and asymmetric the opportunity is.",Ditto!!emote:free_emotes_pack:thumbs_up,1,0.5,0.95,POSITIVE
,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates. July/later calls / shares may be nice risk/reward entered post earnings on 2/29 (so entry next week or so). Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do.

Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates. July/later calls / shares may be nice risk/reward entered post earnings on 2/29 (so entry next week or so). Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank? It‚Äôs not like its readers have that much interest in these tiny-cap companies. They generally read about the big boys. WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing?

The Bulls are harder to find: Twitter Bears: Learn the counterpoints u/AlderLaneEggs u/aureliusvalue u/friendlybearsa u/wolfpackresearch u/froggyspence u/billabbatejr Twitter Bulls: https://twitter.com/determinanted https://twitter.com/Brinkswealth10 Fundamentals Who am I kidding, y‚Äôall care? TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates. July/later calls / shares may be nice risk/reward entered post earnings on 2/29 (so entry next week or so). Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank? It‚Äôs not like its readers have that much interest in these tiny-cap companies. They generally read about the big boys. WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing? SOROS, Group One, Susquehana, HAP Trading are short, along with our old friend Citadel Also, here‚Äôs a list of Bulls and Bears on social media. The Bulls are harder to find: Twitter Bears: Learn the counterpoints u/AlderLaneEggs u/aureliusvalue u/friendlybearsa u/wolfpackresearch u/froggyspence u/billabbatejr Twitter Bulls: https://twitter.com/determinanted https://twitter.com/Brinkswealth10 Fundamentals Who am I kidding, y‚Äôall care? TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation.

Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong.

Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank?

The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank? It‚Äôs not like its readers have that much interest in these tiny-cap companies. They generally read about the big boys. WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing? SOROS, Group One, Susquehana, HAP Trading are short, along with our old friend Citadel Also, here‚Äôs a list of Bulls and Bears on social media. The Bulls are harder to find: Twitter Bears: Learn the counterpoints u/AlderLaneEggs u/aureliusvalue u/friendlybearsa u/wolfpackresearch u/froggyspence u/billabbatejr Twitter Bulls: https://twitter.com/determinanted https://twitter.com/Brinkswealth10 Fundamentals Who am I kidding, y‚Äôall care? TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates. July/later calls / shares may be nice risk/reward entered post earnings on 2/29 (so entry next week or so). Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years.

Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research. Make your own conclusions! This ticker is not discussed enough given how interesting and asymmetric the opportunity is.","So basically, I make money without having to read 45 minutes worth of DD from someone on WSB.I don't even know if you're betting up or down on RILY - they up 22% this month tho, so best luck if ya have calls friend!Deuces!",2,0.518,0.73,NEGATIVE
,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates. July/later calls / shares may be nice risk/reward entered post earnings on 2/29 (so entry next week or so). Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank? It‚Äôs not like its readers have that much interest in these tiny-cap companies. They generally read about the big boys. WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing? SOROS, Group One, Susquehana, HAP Trading are short, along with our old friend Citadel Also, here‚Äôs a list of Bulls and Bears on social media. The Bulls are harder to find: Twitter Bears: Learn the counterpoints u/AlderLaneEggs u/aureliusvalue u/friendlybearsa u/wolfpackresearch u/froggyspence u/billabbatejr Twitter Bulls: https://twitter.com/determinanted https://twitter.com/Brinkswealth10 Fundamentals Who am I kidding, y‚Äôall care? TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates. July/later calls / shares may be nice risk/reward entered post earnings on 2/29 (so entry next week or so). Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank?

WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing? SOROS, Group One, Susquehana, HAP Trading are short, along with our old friend Citadel Also, here‚Äôs a list of Bulls and Bears on social media. The Bulls are harder to find: Twitter Bears: Learn the counterpoints u/AlderLaneEggs u/aureliusvalue u/friendlybearsa u/wolfpackresearch u/froggyspence u/billabbatejr Twitter Bulls: https://twitter.com/determinanted https://twitter.com/Brinkswealth10 Fundamentals Who am I kidding, y‚Äôall care? TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation.

Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research. Make your own conclusions! This ticker is not discussed enough given how interesting and asymmetric the opportunity is.","BOUGHT 4000 RILY the past 2 months.I have followed and traded RILY stock for several years. Recently, I started to accumulate more shares than I ever owned in the past.2023 wasn't the best year for RILY, but this ongoing short case is a joke, in my opinion, and it will fail! I am not buying it at all and am confident in the management.A short squeeze was never a game for me. I love going against the shorts when I am very convinced that they are wrong about a good company, solid business, and great management. Therefore, I did not join the GameStop squeeze and others alike.In the past 12 years, it only happened twice that I loaded up the truck and went against the shorts. Both cases ended up in a massive squeeze, letting me profit 500+ and 900+ percent.I am very confident that RILY will be my 3rd successful short squeeze, and the longer this situation drags out, the better. RILY is paying a nifty dividend, but even better - my broker pays me an interest of 3% per month (36% per year) to lend my stocks out to the shorts. Come on, shorts, borrow all the stocks you want - I'm game!",0,0.552,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates. July/later calls / shares may be nice risk/reward entered post earnings on 2/29 (so entry next week or so). Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank? It‚Äôs not like its readers have that much interest in these tiny-cap companies. They generally read about the big boys. WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing?

This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank? It‚Äôs not like its readers have that much interest in these tiny-cap companies. They generally read about the big boys. WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing? SOROS, Group One, Susquehana, HAP Trading are short, along with our old friend Citadel Also, here‚Äôs a list of Bulls and Bears on social media. The Bulls are harder to find: Twitter Bears: Learn the counterpoints u/AlderLaneEggs u/aureliusvalue u/friendlybearsa u/wolfpackresearch u/froggyspence u/billabbatejr Twitter Bulls: https://twitter.com/determinanted https://twitter.com/Brinkswealth10 Fundamentals Who am I kidding, y‚Äôall care? TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates.

Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates. July/later calls / shares may be nice risk/reward entered post earnings on 2/29 (so entry next week or so). Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank? It‚Äôs not like its readers have that much interest in these tiny-cap companies. They generally read about the big boys. WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing? SOROS, Group One, Susquehana, HAP Trading are short, along with our old friend Citadel Also, here‚Äôs a list of Bulls and Bears on social media. The Bulls are harder to find: Twitter Bears: Learn the counterpoints u/AlderLaneEggs u/aureliusvalue u/friendlybearsa u/wolfpackresearch u/froggyspence u/billabbatejr Twitter Bulls: https://twitter.com/determinanted https://twitter.com/Brinkswealth10 Fundamentals Who am I kidding, y‚Äôall care? TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it.

Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank? It‚Äôs not like its readers have that much interest in these tiny-cap companies. They generally read about the big boys. WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing?

TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes.

WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing?

TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates. July/later calls / shares may be nice risk/reward entered post earnings on 2/29 (so entry next week or so). Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position.

Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank? It‚Äôs not like its readers have that much interest in these tiny-cap companies. They generally read about the big boys. WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing? SOROS, Group One, Susquehana, HAP Trading are short, along with our old friend Citadel Also, here‚Äôs a list of Bulls and Bears on social media. The Bulls are harder to find: Twitter Bears: Learn the counterpoints u/AlderLaneEggs u/aureliusvalue u/friendlybearsa u/wolfpackresearch u/froggyspence u/billabbatejr Twitter Bulls: https://twitter.com/determinanted https://twitter.com/Brinkswealth10 Fundamentals Who am I kidding, y‚Äôall care? TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates. July/later calls / shares may be nice risk/reward entered post earnings on 2/29 (so entry next week or so). Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank? It‚Äôs not like its readers have that much interest in these tiny-cap companies. They generally read about the big boys. WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing? SOROS, Group One, Susquehana, HAP Trading are short, along with our old friend Citadel Also, here‚Äôs a list of Bulls and Bears on social media. The Bulls are harder to find: Twitter Bears: Learn the counterpoints u/AlderLaneEggs u/aureliusvalue u/friendlybearsa u/wolfpackresearch u/froggyspence u/billabbatejr Twitter Bulls: https://twitter.com/determinanted https://twitter.com/Brinkswealth10 Fundamentals Who am I kidding, y‚Äôall care? TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it.

Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong.

Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank? It‚Äôs not like its readers have that much interest in these tiny-cap companies. They generally read about the big boys. WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing?

TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes.

TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates. July/later calls / shares may be nice risk/reward entered post earnings on 2/29 (so entry next week or so). Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position.

This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank? It‚Äôs not like its readers have that much interest in these tiny-cap companies. They generally read about the big boys. WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing? SOROS, Group One, Susquehana, HAP Trading are short, along with our old friend Citadel Also, here‚Äôs a list of Bulls and Bears on social media. The Bulls are harder to find: Twitter Bears: Learn the counterpoints u/AlderLaneEggs u/aureliusvalue u/friendlybearsa u/wolfpackresearch u/froggyspence u/billabbatejr Twitter Bulls: https://twitter.com/determinanted https://twitter.com/Brinkswealth10 Fundamentals Who am I kidding, y‚Äôall care? TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research. Make your own conclusions! This ticker is not discussed enough given how interesting and asymmetric the opportunity is.",It's doing exactly what I predicted - read again. I said earnings dump is stage one,1,0.634,0.876,POSITIVE
,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates.

Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates. July/later calls / shares may be nice risk/reward entered post earnings on 2/29 (so entry next week or so). Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank? It‚Äôs not like its readers have that much interest in these tiny-cap companies. They generally read about the big boys. WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing? SOROS, Group One, Susquehana, HAP Trading are short, along with our old friend Citadel Also, here‚Äôs a list of Bulls and Bears on social media. The Bulls are harder to find: Twitter Bears: Learn the counterpoints u/AlderLaneEggs u/aureliusvalue u/friendlybearsa u/wolfpackresearch u/froggyspence u/billabbatejr Twitter Bulls: https://twitter.com/determinanted https://twitter.com/Brinkswealth10 Fundamentals Who am I kidding, y‚Äôall care? TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it.

They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates. July/later calls / shares may be nice risk/reward entered post earnings on 2/29 (so entry next week or so). Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank? It‚Äôs not like its readers have that much interest in these tiny-cap companies. They generally read about the big boys. WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity?

TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes.

If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing? SOROS, Group One, Susquehana, HAP Trading are short, along with our old friend Citadel Also, here‚Äôs a list of Bulls and Bears on social media. The Bulls are harder to find: Twitter Bears: Learn the counterpoints u/AlderLaneEggs u/aureliusvalue u/friendlybearsa u/wolfpackresearch u/froggyspence u/billabbatejr Twitter Bulls: https://twitter.com/determinanted https://twitter.com/Brinkswealth10 Fundamentals Who am I kidding, y‚Äôall care? TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates. July/later calls / shares may be nice risk/reward entered post earnings on 2/29 (so entry next week or so). Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank?

This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank? It‚Äôs not like its readers have that much interest in these tiny-cap companies. They generally read about the big boys. WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing? SOROS, Group One, Susquehana, HAP Trading are short, along with our old friend Citadel Also, here‚Äôs a list of Bulls and Bears on social media. The Bulls are harder to find: Twitter Bears: Learn the counterpoints u/AlderLaneEggs u/aureliusvalue u/friendlybearsa u/wolfpackresearch u/froggyspence u/billabbatejr Twitter Bulls: https://twitter.com/determinanted https://twitter.com/Brinkswealth10 Fundamentals Who am I kidding, y‚Äôall care? TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates. July/later calls / shares may be nice risk/reward entered post earnings on 2/29 (so entry next week or so).

The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research.

,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates. July/later calls / shares may be nice risk/reward entered post earnings on 2/29 (so entry next week or so). Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank? It‚Äôs not like its readers have that much interest in these tiny-cap companies. They generally read about the big boys. WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing? SOROS, Group One, Susquehana, HAP Trading are short, along with our old friend Citadel Also, here‚Äôs a list of Bulls and Bears on social media. The Bulls are harder to find: Twitter Bears: Learn the counterpoints u/AlderLaneEggs u/aureliusvalue u/friendlybearsa u/wolfpackresearch u/froggyspence u/billabbatejr Twitter Bulls: https://twitter.com/determinanted https://twitter.com/Brinkswealth10 Fundamentals Who am I kidding, y‚Äôall care? TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes. Source: OpenInsider Q4 Earnings - and the post-earnings catalyst So there are plenty of reasons why Q4 earnings - coming up on 2/29 - could be a shitshow. Their balance sheet could take a serious hit from valuations of their private and public equity holdings given full year 2023 revenues for those companies (private) and the publicly traded equities and credit (asset value should reflect decreased overall valuations as of EOY on pretty much all public holdings including ddi, whose increase didn‚Äôt happen until this year). They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***.

They absolutely need to demonstrate good cashflow and balance sheet management - but personally doubt that will show up this time. They paid off most of their 2024 bonds on time. They have to demonstrate that between the cash they have on hand, and cash from operations they‚Äôll be able to pay their 2025 debt obligations to stave off semi-immediate bankruptcy concerns. They have historically paid a dividend, which I believe should end this earnings cycle, losing institutional investors betting on high dividend returns. Post-earnings catalyst Option 1: Earnings is a shit-show, and it‚Äôs so bad that bankruptcy is imminent. Impact: stock sells off and continues to sell off all the way to 0. Opinion: Low likelihood of bankruptcy in 2024 but higher as time moves on. Option 2: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow: Impact: 2025 bonds (due in Feb 2025) will lose their imminent bankruptcy risk pricing Stock may still sell off However, with the high short borrow fee (50%) short profits will start to shrink and without the imminent bankruptcy option they will have to think about exiting w/ profit As they start to exit, hit liquidity issues due to lack of free float Option 3: Balance sheet (audited) actually improves w/ positive cashflow. Company executes a buyback of shares and retires shares. Instead of a $30M dividend, they could expand the current buyback from $50M to $80M (or even more aggressive, depending on financial results). $80M at $16/share = 5 million shares = the entirety of the current free float Impact: Shorts borrow fee would go up Shorts would have to secure new borrows Shorts would fall into prisoner‚Äôs dilemma situation of whomever exit firsts wins as there‚Äôs not enough shares to fully cover Opinion: This to me is the interesting scenario, and it‚Äôs really only worth buying the shares, after earnings, if they are good and an aggressive buyback is executed Price Prediction This part is all speculation. Make your own up, no one knows, and position according to your prediction. Manage your own trades, risk, etc. Stage 1: Earnings Dump - Through Mar 1, Possibly Mar 8 With a 50% borrow fee, shorts need continuous downward movement. Earnings will provide the confirmation or rejection of that fear. Regardless of how good earnings are, I think shorts will push the price down post earnings as put positioning is way higher than call positioning - gamma will help shorts here. So the week of earnings (next week) and probably the week after will continue to sell Stage 2: Controlled Covering ~ Mar 8 - Mar 24 Like I mentioned, most shorts entered after the drop in November 2023. They‚Äôre also profitable, and it really sucks going from green to red in any position. However, after the dust has settled on a post-earnings dump, there will be no pending catalyst; it‚Äôs more likely that post earnings will see sort of buyback activity in any scenario that rily has retained earnings to use, or a dividend to pay out, causing some buys for either buyback or dividend Shorts need continued downward price movement given a 50% borrow fee. Without a catalyst (and if no imminent bankruptcy risk or legal risk, which the recent response works against) there‚Äôs not much left of a downward catalyst So the most reasonable shorts will start to eye the exits in this time frame. I‚Äôve already seen some trades that suggest they‚Äôre eyeing the exits. For example, take a look at this one. This is 1 million shares worth of upside protection and agreement to buy below 15. If you were shorting shares at 20+, you get a net credit of $.9/share, and either you take profits at 15, keep your shorts if flat and buy to close on open market, or if it takes off you can exercise your calls and cover your shorts at 20. I believe shorts will begin to cover after earnings, and use trades like this to cap their losses. That won‚Äôt necessarily cap the price, just the price they pay. Market makers will have to figure out how to hedge that position. Stage 3: UnControlled Covering -> After Mar 8, unknown timeframe With 11M shares short, and covering starting by the most reasonable shorters, the unreasonable ones will be later to exit. The later exits will have a higher price to exit. Some will try to double down with the newly available short availability. However, if RILY executes a buyback, then there‚Äôs even less availability. They can‚Äôt double down as easily without leveraging expensive puts that decay even more than the borrow fee. Shorting becomes even more expensive, while longs are getting paid the lending fee and any dividends/buybacks. At this point, price could spiral, particularly if new investors, say a bunch of retail investors that are pissed at short funds making shit up and turning off a buy button, and see another opportunity to profit and start loading up on calls. There is no way for 11M shares to cover. Right now, 5-6M could probably reasonably cover in the mid double digits but beyond that sky‚Äôs the limit. For longs, upside uncapped, downside capped. This will happen after reasonable shorts exist first. So we would need to see some covering or upward price movement. Ways to Play it - How and When This is how I‚Äôm thinking about it. Choose your own path or do nothing. When - See above - I have some long positions entered this week but I plan to enter the majority of the position after earnings***. Reasons:*** Any pre-earnings positions will likely see some drawdown. I‚Äôll also have the benefit of seeing whether or not the business is on track for default, which invalidates the long thesis. IV will drop after earnings making options cheaper Option 1: Shares Shares, in this situation, should be treated as infinite-date call options. Upside: get paid the lending fee, don‚Äôt have to get the timing right, don‚Äôt need as much upside in price to profit Downside: less leverage, could lose 100% all in the event of bankruptcy / short thesis is correct Option 2: Mid/Long duration Calls I have a prediction about the timeframe. I may be wrong, but I have some reasons for it. So I‚Äôm putting some in calls for April / May / July / later Upside - multiple returns, leveraged, don‚Äôt need to use as much capital to get upside in case of a true squeeze Downside - much more likely to lose 100% in the scenario that a) strong upside doesn‚Äôt materialize / stays flat, or b) rily only recovers a little Option 3: Risk Reversals: You could follow a trade like this, where you sell puts to buy calls. Upside: you get a credit and the trade doesn‚Äôt cost you anything DOWNSIDE - Your capital exposure is the same as the underlying equity. Do not size this beyond what you can choose to get assigned. Position this just as a share position. For example, if you followed the below trade, you don‚Äôt get any upside between 15 and 20, but all of it beyond 20, and you take all of the downside below 15. If you wanted to cap your downside, you could buy a put below 15 Option 4: Capped Risk Reversals: Here‚Äôs an example of this one: I bought a july 20c, sold a 15p, bought a 10p for a net cost of $10 per contract. Max loss is capped at $500 per contract if RILY closes <= 10 in July. You get no gains if RILY trades sideways or moderately recovers, and you get all the losses below 15 through 10, but nothing beyond that. You get all the gains beyond 20. Again, sharing research. Make your own conclusions! This ticker is not discussed enough given how interesting and asymmetric the opportunity is.",You fucked yourself on this one lol,1,0.518,0.807,NEGATIVE
,"Been collecting a bunch of research on this one. Goal of this post is to share this due diligence with links to raise awareness of an asymmetric opportunity. Not financial advice, sharing my research. Make your own decisions, double check any DD. For me, this has a similar (but not as strong - yet) setup to my endgame post from Jan 12, 2021. I‚Äôm slightly long now but plan to get more after earnings as I expect it will likely drop before climbing. TL;DR: Shorts overextended themselves on this one 11M shares short/5M freely traded, are currently in profit; I've published similar DD's before, including a famous 6-part EndGame series. Seen this story before. Capped downside uncapped upside. Expect that short entries will close after this earnings, and with low liquidity the reversal will be strong. I.e. flow will reverse from net selling to net buying post earnings regardless of whether retail participates. July/later calls / shares may be nice risk/reward entered post earnings on 2/29 (so entry next week or so). Summary Company had some shady dealings to buy some low-tier companies, and investors didn‚Äôt like it. This twitter thread has a lot of good callouts to the shady stuff However, outside counsel just completed a review and found no wrongdoing or issues with cap structure of acquisition Market cap is currently <=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions Heavy short positioning in the last 3 months corresponds with heavy negative news cycle, seemingly elevated fear, downward price movement; 3rd most in market, w/ short position > 2x the freely traded float Very low liquidity, small buys/sells move the price significantly Q4 earnings coming up on 2/29 could produce a positive catalyst - all that would need to happen is to avoid path to bankruptcy for shorts to eye the exits (a long hold w/ 50% borrow fee is hard to stay profitable on) Company has paid out a quarterly dividend that may end this cycle in favor of retained earnings, buybacks, or early debt payoff; high dividend payout % seems unsustainable Company has enough cash to currently pay out 2024 liabilities, near-term bankruptcy risk is low Bear: Company has a mix of businesses some of which are truly underperforming while others are ongoing minor cash cows - a really bad Q4 earnings is a death knell Bear: Company levered up significantly to acquire aggressively over the last 2 years; if these acquisitions don‚Äôt pan out bankruptcy risk is real in 2025+ Bull: short thesis requires significant, downward move (w/ 50% cost of carry for shorts) while longs get paid to hold Bear: Shorts control the majority of daily trading volume and price action, so any pump gets sold off without enough sustained buying pressure; something needs to fundamentally shift to attract investors Bear: Current put positioning helps short sellers (MMs sell more as puts get more itm). Counter: Gamma works in both directions Overview: RILY is a financial services / investment bank / private equity company that offers a mix of services w/ 2200 employees that‚Äôs been around for 27 years. Here‚Äôs their investor day presentation from Dec 2023 going into depth on what they do. Market making, underwriting, liquidation, wealth management, equity research, etc. along with direct public and private debt and equity investment. It‚Äôs their private takeover of FRG in 2023 that has gotten them into some trouble. Here‚Äôs the set of their trading symbols from their last 10-Q (3Q 2024) filing RILY positioning - longs and shorts. The short positioning is untenable in the situation that RILY does not go bankrupt. u/cbarkleysgolfswing outlined the impossibly tight liquidity situation in a previous post: (though I disagree on some points like insider buys and dividend as I talk about below): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194971b/rily_shorts_are_crowded_someones_gonna_get_pounded/ Right now there are 10+M shares sold short, with 12+M shares held by insiders, and 15+M held by institutions. There are only 30.5M shares outstanding. The majority of the 15M shares held by institutions are held by funds. The amount held by institutions can vary somewhat but generally stays constant as many are tracked to indices. We can assume that institutional holdings will not drop below roughly 12.5M shares for as long as RILY is tracked in indices. That means that of the 30.5M shares, roughly 25M are not freely traded, leaving only 5M shares in free trading. Short positioning is currently at 200% of freely traded shares. If RILY does not go bankrupt, and furthermore if there is a reason for RILY short sellers to close or for new investors to buy, there will be no exit for RILY short sellers that are late to close. (note that since the previous post, insider holdings and institutional holdings have increased). Short selling, since Nov 2023, has had a major lift in activity (Source: TradingView). On a daily basis, short volume is well above 60% of trading volume. This is extreme - means that 2 out of every daily trades is either a short to open or buy to close of a short position. Another way to say this, is that shorts are currently controlling the price action. (Source: Finra)üì∑ Combined with extremely low liquidity it‚Äôs very easy for short sellers (or buyers) to sway the price of the underlying. Shorts are paying roughly 50% borrow fee and are at full utilization of available borrows (Source: Ortex): Most of these shorts have been added in the last 3 months - i.e. after the big drop in November: Most short shares added in the last 3 months There is heavy positioning on put vs call OI skewed to the downside with extremely high IV**:** (Source: OptionCharts) It's so bad that the open interest put-call ratio is literally off the charts (diagram goes from 0-2 and rily‚Äôs value is at 3.27 LOL - literally any higher and the chart goes back to green) Lol at the put-call ratio Along with the increased short positioning, there has been significant increase in negative analyst coverage: At least 4 different law firms filing class action lawsuits suing for securities fraud tied to acquisition of FRG Articles by SeekingAlpha etc. Also something really fishy - Wall Street Journal coverage ‚ÄúHow an unremarkable deal became a big threat to a small IB‚Äù ‚ÄúUnraveling the money trail‚Ä¶‚Äù Now why would WSJ cover a tiny investment bank? It‚Äôs not like its readers have that much interest in these tiny-cap companies. They generally read about the big boys. WSJ Reporter who wrote the hit piece on RILY used to work at short-selling fund So, Jonathan Weil, who used to work at a hedge fund known for short selling, writes a WSJ article covering a small investment bank that is currently dominated by short selling activity? If that doesn‚Äôt pass the stink test for you‚Ä¶ Oh, look who Jonathan Weil follows on Twitter - the most vocal twitter bear As a result of all of this short activity, the equity for RILY is trading very poorly, basically down to covid lows: Additionally, bonds are beginning to price in liquidity risks for the company: (source, tradingview) RILY's 2025 bonds are pricing in some liquidity risk though bounced off recent lows So who‚Äôs short this thing? SOROS, Group One, Susquehana, HAP Trading are short, along with our old friend Citadel Also, here‚Äôs a list of Bulls and Bears on social media.

TL;DR They make money from a bunch of different business lines. ~$100M gross profit from operations (koyfin) Realized some investment losses last quarter Have loans from their acquisitions RILY has 27+ years of financial operations. Here‚Äôs an example from their investor day deck: That brings in decent income relative to their market cap: On the other hand, RILY owns and operates a motley crew of some really ‚Ä¶ unsexy‚Ä¶ companies as a result of its debt-fueled acquisitions: Targus (bc backpacks and financial services go well)? Mix of companies from FRG acquisition (31% stake) E.g. Pet Supplies Plus E.g. Buddy‚Äôs home furnishings Their entire communications portfolio of semi-dying companies (at least for which they make money in excess of their investment) But the investment arm is where all of the ??? are: Their public equity holdings are pretty terrible: Alta: 20% of their public equity, down 3% since sep 30 Bw: 20% of their public equity, down 73% since sept 30 DDI: 15% of their public equity, up 53% since Sept 30 (but most of the gains coming in 2024 so will not show in their Q4 results) Bebe: 15% of their public equity (trades OTC!, they own 75% of the company), down 40% since sept 30 üì∑ Public equity makes up 15% of their investment, but overall public equities they've held are pretty terrible FRG Acquisition: Take private at 2.8B - 2B of loan financing and 800M of equity, 31% coming from RILY, with some really high loan rates Take-private of FRG at EV of $2.8B funded by $2B of debt and $800MM of equity They valued it at $5.9B. Opinion: This seems high to me given the bottom rung of these companies and basing valuations off of 2026 estimates for companies that have declining revenues: Fact: That being said, they just entered into an agreement to sell Sylvan at $185M (they effectively bought it for $81M), so the valuation on that one at $165EV was at least fine. Opinion: All could be a red herring though, as Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and American Freight make up much of the valuation. American Freight is particularly ugly to me - ugly site, ugly product, ugly revenue growth (how a durable goods company had this significant topline revenue decline in a high inflation year is really really ugly): Opinion: The problem is they made this acquisition with $2B of debt. Very real bills to play. If these companies can be sold off or turned around - big win. If not, they‚Äôre in trouble. Dividends and Insider Buys For the most part, Bryant Riley (Chairman, CEO) has been using dividends paid to himself (as a shareholder) to buy shares on the open market. A weird, tax inefficient buyback. Would have been better to just do a buyback. Bryant Riley (Chairman and CEO) has about 7M shares. I calculated the amount he's received in dividends and compared it to the buybacks he's performed on the open market. He's spent 50% of the dividend income on buybacks, which is roughly what he'd have left on those dividends post taxes.
