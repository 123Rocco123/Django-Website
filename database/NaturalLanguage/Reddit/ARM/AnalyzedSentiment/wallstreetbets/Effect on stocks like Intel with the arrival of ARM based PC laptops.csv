,"With the upcoming release of the Microsoft surface tablet running on a very fast ARM based processor from Qualcomm, I think there is going to be a big shift in the next couple years, to where most laptops sold will eventually be ARM based. Now, a company like Intel, or AMD, have a fairly sizeable market on PC’s, and this is likely to have a serious impact on future sales, unless they follow suite. The power efficiency for laptops running ARM chips cannot be overstated, and people will definitely want to make the switch for office based work. I believe most offices have been transitioning from desktops to laptops for years now as well? The market for these new systems is going to be huge in a couple years. So what, in your opinion, is the best way to profit from this? Will Qualcomm become the next Nvidia?",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,0.999,NEGATIVE

AI is definitely the big thing, and these processes are very well suited to that. So the demand for these processors will grow because of AI as well. Screw Microsoft. I’m wondering what it’s going to be like when other manufacturers start making ARM based laptops.",1,0.547,0.997,NEGATIVE

So what, in your opinion, is the best way to profit from this? Will Qualcomm become the next Nvidia?","I'm taking the opposite position from what most people will say. ARM is going to overtake the personal PC market for CPUs.A surprisingly large number of users ONLY have a cell phone or tablet. ARM is perfect for 99.9% of PC use: web browsing, video streaming, office apps. Putting ARM chips in laptops will just give a larger screen space, keyboard, while allowing room for a larger battery.There's also been enough progress converting x86 programs to various ARMS that software availability is not an issue (for apps that aren't web-based, because let's be honest that's where it's all headed).",0,0.527,0.951,POSITIVE

Especially those Users.For the non technical user, there would be no way to even tell if they have an ARM or X86 CPU in their machine, provided the operating system conversion is done right.",1,0.516,0.994,POSITIVE

Will Qualcomm become the next Nvidia?","Sorry, Those two points were disjointed.Phone/tablet users show that their needs can be met with an ARM chip. Thus manufacturer of notebooks/towers will move to an ARM system to take advantage of the reduced power usage and extra space in their designs.For instance: you can buy a laptop with an x86... OR you can buy this ARM one that gets 10 hrs more battery life and is 1lb lighter.",2,0.525,1.0,NEGATIVE

I mean ther where those low power notebooks and even desktops always, with chrome books or Intel atom etc. Never really caught on. The thing is, PC users do different things with their machines than mobile device users.Now Apple has shown that the ARM design can be scaled up to meet those demands, but you still can't, say, swap a 4090 in to train your AI models or play the latest games.I'm sure a MS based ARM system could be designed in a way that you can, but really what's the big difference in the resulting system then. CPU only makes part of a system and its overall power consumption.At the end it will come down to price/performance and compatability. As we have seen in the past for example with the switch to ia64 architecture, compatability can take a long time.",3,0.531,0.999,NEGATIVE
