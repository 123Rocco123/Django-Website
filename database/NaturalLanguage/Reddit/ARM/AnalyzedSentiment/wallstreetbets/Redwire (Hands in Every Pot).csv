,"My Bull Reasoning for Redwire So some people have asked what’s the bull case or where Redwire has to grow. Below is a cumulative list in no particular order of my opinion. I’ve been in as low as $4, sold a fair share mid 7s but then loaded up in the $8 when I realized it wasn’t going down again and haven’t sold a share since then. I’ve done the same with rocket lab and this company is another sleeping monster. Again I fully feel it’s better to dca or at least do low level limit orders in order to not drive the price too high too fast. (I’m still dcaing at almost 14,000 shares) Note if you’re trying to get in I highly recommend you get what you can prior to Trump signing executive orders. No you don’t need to load up all in one day but stress manufacturing in space will be a priority for the Trump administration. Pilbox- market for it just in the pilboxes alone and as well as royalties from the crystals grown and other experiments within it. HIV market is alone 34 billion TAM. Bristol myers and eli lilly are two companies we partnered with and they are one of the heavy leaders in that field. Could expect millions annually if drug crystals grown in space show the purity levels that the chemists expect. Multiple avenues here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VttNK2UuY_w 2A. 3D bio printing- Goal is for organs which could be 7-10 years away pending how these next experiments go. Ultimate goal is manufacturing a full heart which costs 2 million alone for a donated heart (check the amount on the waiting list to receive a heart) over 3,000. Even 300 hearts a year you’re looking at over $600 million a year(I imagine a heart tailored to not be rejected would cost maybe 5-10 million)There are other applications they are trying to pursue as well with their 3d bio printing.(Knee, valves, heart patches etc) 2B. They could potentialy grow human tissues for drug and cosmetic testing, which could in turn render animal testing obsolete. That's great news for the animals, but on a financial note this could be huge, as it could accelerate bringing drugs to market as one important and costly development step could be skipped by going straight to human testing on printed tissues. 2C. Microgravity research and manufacturing includes semiconductors, agricultural, life support, etc https://redwirespace.com/newsroom/new-redwire-investigations-launching-on-spx-31-include-crystallization-and-plant-experiments-to-improve-life-on-earth-and-expand-humanitys-presence-in-space/ 3. VLEO- look up darpa with their otter program. Phase four, epl and redwire has been awarded contracts for this. Phase Four and Redwire received the most. Budget from DARPA for this year is 25 million, 2025 increased to -62 million with 2026 expected to be increased two fold again as we will be getting into the operation phase. For Europe we have SKIMSAT and Phantom. 4. Valkyrie Hall effect thrusters - Huge market for this. Redwire partnering with Phase Four on the developing of these…multiple applications. Full rate production starting 2025. 5. Link 16 - Redwire has the best link 16 antennas on the market. Even though there are some issues the FCC has, link 16 is too important for national security to pull away from. This market will only be increasing. https://redwirespace.com/newsroom/sda-completes-another-major-link-16-testing-milestone-with-successful-space-to-ship-demonstration/Currently subcontracted by York Space Systems and Rocket Lab. 6. Overseas market - I see some huge potential with Dubai and some other European markets. Redwire recently won a contract/grant from ESA for robotic arm development. 7. Redwires software line- not just hardware but they provide software to nasa and other space agencies. Veritrek for thermal analysis and ACORN for digital engineering. 8. Roll out solar arrays (ROSA) - Astrobotic’s Lunar Vertical Solar Array Technology program to deliver power on the lunar surface. 8 ROSA Thales Alina Space has put ROSA on their GEO satellites as a baseline option, Blue Ring strategic partner, we have 25 orders as of September 2024. 9. SDA contracting- potential for trache 3 awards but at the very least will receive subcontracting work for their antenna line. Rocket Lab selected them as a subcontractor for their antennas which with how rocket lab is all about doing their own research/work, has shown how far ahead redwire is in this antenna tech and has imo given up the fight in this market. 10. Their Robust camera line for both lunar/orbit, sun sensors/star trackers(Most of recent award for next generation interceptor program) 11. Fablab https://redwirespace.com/newsroom/redwire-wins-nasa-contract-to-advance-new-in-space-manufacturing-capability-for-journeys-to-moon-mars-and-beyond/ 12. Developed systems to build landing pads, roads and other forms of infrastructure on the moon. 13. Management looking after shareholder value. CEO by the books alone has made it clear that they aren’t trying to flood the market with shares. CEO currently holds about 143,000 shares. The board/CEO is very tight with their wallet when it comes to share issuance.","TLDRTicker: RDW Direction: Up Prognosis: Buy and hold. OP is bullish long term due to Redwire's diverse space-related projects and partnerships. Main Points: OP believes Redwire is undervalued and has potential for significant growth due to its involvement in various space technologies like 3D bioprinting, in-space manufacturing, satellite components, and lunar infrastructure development. They also praise the management for being shareholder-friendly. OP recommends DCAing into the stock.",0,0.537,POSITIVE,0.508

No you don’t need to load up all in one day but stress manufacturing in space will be a priority for the Trump administration. Pilbox- market for it just in the pilboxes alone and as well as royalties from the crystals grown and other experiments within it. HIV market is alone 34 billion TAM. Bristol myers and eli lilly are two companies we partnered with and they are one of the heavy leaders in that field. Could expect millions annually if drug crystals grown in space show the purity levels that the chemists expect. Multiple avenues here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VttNK2UuY_w 2A. 3D bio printing- Goal is for organs which could be 7-10 years away pending how these next experiments go. Ultimate goal is manufacturing a full heart which costs 2 million alone for a donated heart (check the amount on the waiting list to receive a heart) over 3,000. Even 300 hearts a year you’re looking at over $600 million a year(I imagine a heart tailored to not be rejected would cost maybe 5-10 million)There are other applications they are trying to pursue as well with their 3d bio printing.(Knee, valves, heart patches etc) 2B. They could potentialy grow human tissues for drug and cosmetic testing, which could in turn render animal testing obsolete. That's great news for the animals, but on a financial note this could be huge, as it could accelerate bringing drugs to market as one important and costly development step could be skipped by going straight to human testing on printed tissues. 2C.

VLEO- look up darpa with their otter program. Phase four, epl and redwire has been awarded contracts for this. Phase Four and Redwire received the most. Budget from DARPA for this year is 25 million, 2025 increased to -62 million with 2026 expected to be increased two fold again as we will be getting into the operation phase. For Europe we have SKIMSAT and Phantom. 4. Valkyrie Hall effect thrusters - Huge market for this. Redwire partnering with Phase Four on the developing of these…multiple applications. Full rate production starting 2025. 5. Link 16 - Redwire has the best link 16 antennas on the market. Even though there are some issues the FCC has, link 16 is too important for national security to pull away from.

Overseas market - I see some huge potential with Dubai and some other European markets. Redwire recently won a contract/grant from ESA for robotic arm development. 7. Redwires software line- not just hardware but they provide software to nasa and other space agencies. Veritrek for thermal analysis and ACORN for digital engineering. 8. Roll out solar arrays (ROSA) - Astrobotic’s Lunar Vertical Solar Array Technology program to deliver power on the lunar surface. 8 ROSA Thales Alina Space has put ROSA on their GEO satellites as a baseline option, Blue Ring strategic partner, we have 25 orders as of September 2024. 9. SDA contracting- potential for trache 3 awards but at the very least will receive subcontracting work for their antenna line. Rocket Lab selected them as a subcontractor for their antennas which with how rocket lab is all about doing their own research/work, has shown how far ahead redwire is in this antenna tech and has imo given up the fight in this market. 10.

,"My Bull Reasoning for Redwire So some people have asked what’s the bull case or where Redwire has to grow. Below is a cumulative list in no particular order of my opinion. I’ve been in as low as $4, sold a fair share mid 7s but then loaded up in the $8 when I realized it wasn’t going down again and haven’t sold a share since then. I’ve done the same with rocket lab and this company is another sleeping monster. Again I fully feel it’s better to dca or at least do low level limit orders in order to not drive the price too high too fast.
