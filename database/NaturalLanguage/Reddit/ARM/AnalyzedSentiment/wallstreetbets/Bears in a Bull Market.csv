""Everything that goes up, must come down"" the bear thinks to himself. Value investing, fundamentals and all that. Any company that has >100% gain in a single year is gearing up for a massive correction. En masse, they sacrifice their portfolios to giant green dildos. Then, miraculously, they win. The Big Red comes, and maybe 2% of all put positions actually profit because all the other bears ran out of money failing to time the top. The winners start salivating. If one company goes down, why not another? Why not the whole sector? Why not the entire market? Why not the economy? And so, the bears continue to short, unbeknowst to the fact they are speculators, too. Values investing? Fundamentals? Meaningless when you can make $10M from the entire country going tits up.

Can someone please explain to me why bears exist, am I regarded?","Not bearish or a perma-bull. I'm waiting. The stock market is up more of the time than it's down (even if inflation-adjusted). But bull markets eventually get crazy optimistic and euphoric. Not just ""growth over value"", but insanity over both. The last skeptical buyers and the slow joiners buy. Who, then, is left to keep buying after the run-up? The market falters, drifts down a little, has (steep) fake-out rallies, deteriorates, and finally depresses people. (Young people have not seen a real bear market. The COVID dip was only a dip.) As the bear progresses,, people depend on hope for recovery. When that fails they get even more depressed and start hating the stock market. Sometimes, supposed ""haven"" investments don't do much better, as a lot of people start to need their CASH and sell every type. Then the bear market eventually goes down to insane depths of despair, until a magic moment (sometimes called ""capitulation"") at the bottom. Bear markets usually don't last as long as bull markets, but they can go down deep, over 60% down. And they don't just hurt bad stocks. Good, even ""value,"" stocks go down too.The current bull market followed a flood of three trillion new US dollars dumped from heaven; the flood has diminished but the effects continue. Still a lot of spare money sloshing around.A 1972 book was ""Juncture Recognition in the Stock Market"" by W. G. Bretz; never mind his theory; the title -- juncture recognition -- is what we need. When will this bull market end? My current guess is: when businesses lose faith in Large-Language-Model-based AI, on which Nvidia now depends. Slogan: ""When NVDA starts to go, watch out below."" That's not a specific price target or a date target, rather an if-then event target. Could be next week or a year away. I'd also keep an eye on JPM; when ""best of breed"" falls, others fall more. Until then, bullish. (Aspen Aerogels and Abercrombie & Fitch are rising faster than Nvidia.)When the juncture finally seems to get near: NVDA puts? Selling? Unfortunately, I like buying and dislike selling. I hope I'll act when the madness ends.",1,0.542,1.0,NEGATIVE

This means that the bulls are caught between a rock and a hard place. The problem for the bulls is then that they obviously need the NVDA company to keep on performing well, which will then cause the stock price to go higher. That's then supposed to happen continuously from now on.But this then means that the required earnings of NVDA to reach the point where dividends and stock buybacks can have a good yield gets farther and farther away. So, even assuming that all the bullish thesis about the future AI market and NVDA's market share in that market are correct, NVDA stock is now overvalued to the point where it has become a meme stock.And there are big problems with the bullish thesis about the future AI market, as pointed out here.",0,0.587,1.0,NEGATIVE
