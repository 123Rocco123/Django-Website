Instead of selling I did a lot of DD. In my opinion they are not the average SPAC. Their management team is A1 and who doesn’t like that they have real relationships with NASA ($719mil contract) Space X, Northrop Grumman to name a few. Too many catalysts here for me: Successful landing bags them $118mil from NASA Another launch scheduled for March Earnings report coming in March were they should be able to report 4th Quarter revenue from the $719mil OMES contract and the receipt of the $118mil from NASA. Any tweet from Elon Musk ignites his millions of followers. By the way, space is Musk’s baby. IM-3 mission planned for June. At 3rd Quarter earnings call they said that they have submitted over $3bil in proposals. If IM-1 is successful, I believe some of these contracts will be awarded.With this landing they will show NASA and the entire world that they can accomplish this feat under a specific budget.
