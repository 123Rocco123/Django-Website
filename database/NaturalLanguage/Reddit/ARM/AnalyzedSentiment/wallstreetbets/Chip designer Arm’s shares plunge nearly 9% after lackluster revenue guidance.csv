,,"For a company that's so important in our world, from not just the notable chips in our phones but almost even more so the hundreds of tiny chips and MCUs designed by ARM or running the ARM ISA that each one of us interacts with so many times in every day without knowing it, they make surprisingly little money.I could see them growing to earn a lot more, but it would take more like years to even decades of slowly charging more while also becoming even more omnipresent, if they do too much at once people would look at something like RISC-V. Step 1 I guess was to be everywhere first and become the default ISA and toolchain for so much.",1,0.53,0.996,POSITIVE
