,"This might be one of Microsoft's most influential quarters in quite some time. The main argument for my thesis is OpenAI and recent AI model upgrades from in the form of GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-o1, and GPT-o1-mini. As well, I don't know if anyone noticed their Uranium portfolio's going through the roof but if not check out SMR, OKLO and others to see more. AI needs so much power that they are opening up defunct nuclear power plants on 3-mile island in Pennsylvania for new energy sources. What most media types don't have a window into, mostly I assume this because they keep saying the same silly thing over and over again, is that enterprise is using AI. AI is not going to come in the form of a ""killer app"". The killer app is ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Mistral. Those are the killer apps but those are also not important things in the AI arms race. AI in and of in itself is the killer app. The reason for this is that it commoditized intelligence in the form of tokens that can be literally bought and sold through the cloud. When certain media types keep railing on the notion that ""who's making money with this"" they are missing the reality in that people are making money with this each and every day. The enterprise is creating applications that are simply not understood by everyday people or analysts because there not the ""killer apps"" that people think of which represents mostly something popular that teenagers and young adults are into. Is Venmo a killer app? Is Facebook a killer apps still? I don't know maybe I'm just not with the times. What i do know is that is that AI is so large and so democratized that the use cases, while not killer, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in the enterprise setting. This is the fast and steady drum beat of GAI increasingly taking over all human cognitive tasks. It won't happen overnight but it is happening. I think what is happening with the media is that they can't put a metric to it so I will attempt to. AI adoption and penetration into everyday processes and tasks for enterprise is probably at 0.6%-1%. If you include the backlog of potential AI penetration it is probably 2 - 5% of all enterprise tasks and processes. The immediate 1 - 2 year outlook of AI penetration is probably 1 - 3% with a backlog of 6-9%. To be clear, I am not considering productivity gains because who the hell cares about any of that. I am specifically speaking about cold hard ROI of implementing an AI automation system and having that AI do the work that was once a human task now offloading to an AI automation task. I don't know how you feel about the above numbers but in my interpretation it is incredibly slow but growth can be incredibly exponential in relatively a short amount of time. The reason, I've written about this many times before, is because the data is not ready, the talent is not there to reconstruct and rebuild what needs to be in place to make efficient data process that are specific to AI, and many many other factors. This is why consulting through the likes of Accenture, Palantir, IBM and others will be very important in the coming years. It's my opinion that companies now matter how large or small won't be able to put in the right processes without proven practices that will foster from consultancy groups rather than at home grown talent. However, there will be clues of how well the progress is going. An AI channel check if you will. AI Channel Check through Microsoft Azure: Microsoft provides this channel check for us. Alphabet just completed their channel check and the news on AI was good. Continued spending for all things AI and healthy numbers in their core businesses to justify the continued spend. I look for Microsoft to report much in the same way in terms of AI CapEx/Spend. 2 quarters ago Microsoft started reporting the AI portion of their Azure Cloud revenues. 2 quarters ago it was 6%, and the previous quarter it rose to 7%. For their earnings report tomorrow the AI revenue should be in the 10-12% range. In my opinion 8% is not going to cut it. 1% quarterly gain seems slow. The number in aggregate should be 2%+ quarter to quarter growth. In this way, 1% isn't going to cut it for Wall Street. Perhaps we do see 8%-9% next quarter and that wouldn't be a horrible thing but if Microsoft wants to blow the doors off of earnings and reestablish a healthy growth pattern it is of my opinion that number of percent AI revenue shares needs a meaningful bps up. I believe that in this earnings there will be that meaningful click upwards of AI percentage growth for Microsoft in the 10%+ range. 11% would be a bust out surprise and 12% would be significantly positive. So where is this possible 3% rise in AI revenue growth coming from? Look no further than GPT-4o. GPT-4o and the AI Number Gpt-4o was initially released on May 13, 2024. For reference, Microsoft's last quarter was, Q4 2024, ended on June 30, 2024, with earnings reported on July 30, 2024. AI number 7%. There was no way for GPT-4o to significantly penetrate into their earnings with only roughly 30 days of usage. If you take into account the iterations of 4o itself the model initially was met with skepticism (compared to GPT-4-Turbo) and apprehension until subsequent versions of 4o were released. All-in-all, there is no way GPT-4o was going to be in the previous quarters (Q4) earnings report. However, what's even more interesting is the increase in quota and throughput of GPT-4 to GPT-4o. This is where I believe the AI number from Microsoft will materially increase. Let's take a look. First, let's start with GPT-4-Turbo which was released November 6, 2023. Git Commit e477326: Commit e477326 was dated to Nov 22, 2023. A preview was available, 1106, as of Nov 17, 2023. Using this as a ground truth you can see that the token limit is 134k per minute with a max of 2.7 K requests per minute. this and surely prior to this was hell on enterprises to do any meaningful work with the models. It was great for experimenting and getting started but not for meaningful production work. GPT-4o was released on May 13, 2024. Git Commit 431bb24: Commit 431bb24 was dated to May 20, 2024. As you can see from previous GPT-4 capacity limitations GPT-4o introduced a massive improvement for quota limit TPM and requests per minute RPM. This is a significant release for enterprise customers as they can now begin to plan, develop, and execute AI software stacks into production environments. 60 K RPM's is a 22X upgrade towards production throughput. Git Commit 30084ae: Commit 30084ae was dated July 24, 2024. In this update the quota TPM was raised from 10M to 30M tokens per minute. Current Quota Limits: In the current quota limits there is a 180 K RPM increase from 60 K. At this point and earlier in the quarter OpenAI's GPT-4o models became capacity unlocked. There is nothing you cannot do or plan for in terms of AI model integrations, TPM's, or RPM throughput. At this moment, intelligence is untethered from any api constraints. What you can imagine building in terms of AI and LLMs and the delivery of those products and services can be fully realized without constraint. If you go from the beginning analysis of GPT-4-Turbo until today there is a 223X tokens per minute (TPM) increase and a 66.66X request per minute (RPM) increase. This is a massive throughput gain that cannot be expressed enough of how significant this is in terms of AI advancements regarding enterprise adoption. This is why I believe the AI Number finally breaks the double digits in this quarter of 10%+. Ever since the last quarter ended, June 30, 2024, there has been a steady stream of AI model improvements and api throughput improvements that are significant in scope. If you couple this with Google's continued AI spend and quality quarter, AI hardware channel checks that verify the AI hardware spend, and a github repo commit history that shows nothing but blazing improvements for Microsoft Azure intelligence; It could not be more clear to me that Microsoft is executing on all levels and should deliver a potentially monster quarter. Not that it needs it but here is the plug for NVDA as well. All of those github commits and throughput improvements are directly related to Microsoft bringing data centers online all over the world. This is insane! I don't have to tell you the git commits for this graph are absolutely bonkers too. I have shares in MSFT, NVDA, ARM, VRT, and 1 share of SMCI.

There is nothing you cannot do or plan for in terms of AI model integrations, TPM's, or RPM throughput. At this moment, intelligence is untethered from any api constraints. What you can imagine building in terms of AI and LLMs and the delivery of those products and services can be fully realized without constraint. If you go from the beginning analysis of GPT-4-Turbo until today there is a 223X tokens per minute (TPM) increase and a 66.66X request per minute (RPM) increase. This is a massive throughput gain that cannot be expressed enough of how significant this is in terms of AI advancements regarding enterprise adoption. This is why I believe the AI Number finally breaks the double digits in this quarter of 10%+. Ever since the last quarter ended, June 30, 2024, there has been a steady stream of AI model improvements and api throughput improvements that are significant in scope. If you couple this with Google's continued AI spend and quality quarter, AI hardware channel checks that verify the AI hardware spend, and a github repo commit history that shows nothing but blazing improvements for Microsoft Azure intelligence; It could not be more clear to me that Microsoft is executing on all levels and should deliver a potentially monster quarter. Not that it needs it but here is the plug for NVDA as well. All of those github commits and throughput improvements are directly related to Microsoft bringing data centers online all over the world.

AI adoption and penetration into everyday processes and tasks for enterprise is probably at 0.6%-1%.

The immediate 1 - 2 year outlook of AI penetration is probably 1 - 3% with a backlog of 6-9%. To be clear, I am not considering productivity gains because who the hell cares about any of that. I am specifically speaking about cold hard ROI of implementing an AI automation system and having that AI do the work that was once a human task now offloading to an AI automation task.

Alphabet just completed their channel check and the news on AI was good. Continued spending for all things AI and healthy numbers in their core businesses to justify the continued spend. I look for Microsoft to report much in the same way in terms of AI CapEx/Spend. 2 quarters ago Microsoft started reporting the AI portion of their Azure Cloud revenues. 2 quarters ago it was 6%, and the previous quarter it rose to 7%. For their earnings report tomorrow the AI revenue should be in the 10-12% range. In my opinion 8% is not going to cut it. 1% quarterly gain seems slow. The number in aggregate should be 2%+ quarter to quarter growth. In this way, 1% isn't going to cut it for Wall Street. Perhaps we do see 8%-9% next quarter and that wouldn't be a horrible thing but if Microsoft wants to blow the doors off of earnings and reestablish a healthy growth pattern it is of my opinion that number of percent AI revenue shares needs a meaningful bps up. I believe that in this earnings there will be that meaningful click upwards of AI percentage growth for Microsoft in the 10%+ range. 11% would be a bust out surprise and 12% would be significantly positive. So where is this possible 3% rise in AI revenue growth coming from? Look no further than GPT-4o. GPT-4o and the AI Number Gpt-4o was initially released on May 13, 2024. For reference, Microsoft's last quarter was, Q4 2024, ended on June 30, 2024, with earnings reported on July 30, 2024. AI number 7%. There was no way for GPT-4o to significantly penetrate into their earnings with only roughly 30 days of usage. If you take into account the iterations of 4o itself the model initially was met with skepticism (compared to GPT-4-Turbo) and apprehension until subsequent versions of 4o were released. All-in-all, there is no way GPT-4o was going to be in the previous quarters (Q4) earnings report. However, what's even more interesting is the increase in quota and throughput of GPT-4 to GPT-4o. This is where I believe the AI number from Microsoft will materially increase. Let's take a look. First, let's start with GPT-4-Turbo which was released November 6, 2023. Git Commit e477326: Commit e477326 was dated to Nov 22, 2023. A preview was available, 1106, as of Nov 17, 2023. Using this as a ground truth you can see that the token limit is 134k per minute with a max of 2.7 K requests per minute. this and surely prior to this was hell on enterprises to do any meaningful work with the models.

As you can see from previous GPT-4 capacity limitations GPT-4o introduced a massive improvement for quota limit TPM and requests per minute RPM. This is a significant release for enterprise customers as they can now begin to plan, develop, and execute AI software stacks into production environments. 60 K RPM's is a 22X upgrade towards production throughput.

All-in-all, there is no way GPT-4o was going to be in the previous quarters (Q4) earnings report. However, what's even more interesting is the increase in quota and throughput of GPT-4 to GPT-4o. This is where I believe the AI number from Microsoft will materially increase. Let's take a look. First, let's start with GPT-4-Turbo which was released November 6, 2023. Git Commit e477326: Commit e477326 was dated to Nov 22, 2023. A preview was available, 1106, as of Nov 17, 2023. Using this as a ground truth you can see that the token limit is 134k per minute with a max of 2.7 K requests per minute. this and surely prior to this was hell on enterprises to do any meaningful work with the models. It was great for experimenting and getting started but not for meaningful production work. GPT-4o was released on May 13, 2024. Git Commit 431bb24: Commit 431bb24 was dated to May 20, 2024. As you can see from previous GPT-4 capacity limitations GPT-4o introduced a massive improvement for quota limit TPM and requests per minute RPM. This is a significant release for enterprise customers as they can now begin to plan, develop, and execute AI software stacks into production environments. 60 K RPM's is a 22X upgrade towards production throughput. Git Commit 30084ae: Commit 30084ae was dated July 24, 2024. In this update the quota TPM was raised from 10M to 30M tokens per minute. Current Quota Limits: In the current quota limits there is a 180 K RPM increase from 60 K. At this point and earlier in the quarter OpenAI's GPT-4o models became capacity unlocked. There is nothing you cannot do or plan for in terms of AI model integrations, TPM's, or RPM throughput. At this moment, intelligence is untethered from any api constraints. What you can imagine building in terms of AI and LLMs and the delivery of those products and services can be fully realized without constraint. If you go from the beginning analysis of GPT-4-Turbo until today there is a 223X tokens per minute (TPM) increase and a 66.66X request per minute (RPM) increase. This is a massive throughput gain that cannot be expressed enough of how significant this is in terms of AI advancements regarding enterprise adoption. This is why I believe the AI Number finally breaks the double digits in this quarter of 10%+. Ever since the last quarter ended, June 30, 2024, there has been a steady stream of AI model improvements and api throughput improvements that are significant in scope. If you couple this with Google's continued AI spend and quality quarter, AI hardware channel checks that verify the AI hardware spend, and a github repo commit history that shows nothing but blazing improvements for Microsoft Azure intelligence; It could not be more clear to me that Microsoft is executing on all levels and should deliver a potentially monster quarter. Not that it needs it but here is the plug for NVDA as well. All of those github commits and throughput improvements are directly related to Microsoft bringing data centers online all over the world. This is insane! I don't have to tell you the git commits for this graph are absolutely bonkers too. I have shares in MSFT, NVDA, ARM, VRT, and 1 share of SMCI. When does SMCI report again?","Disclaimer: ex-dev in Azure. I do not think the growth will be ""monster"", more like cat-sized. (I'd love to be wrong because I never sold my RSUs/ESPP stocks)Re: commoditized intelligence in the form of tokens.This so called commoditized intelligence is fast depreciating. The benefit to the model building companies is then of the ecosystem they've built. https://www.cautiousoptimism.news/p/why-that-ai-model-you-love-is-the You're also missing the wider impact of Llama/Claude and the leverage it has offered to competitors. Amazon/Apple/Tesla spend nearly nothing on research and reap all the benefits of research, primarily because of Llama.I agree on the impact on cognitive task. Example of my domain, GitHub Copilot/ReplIt Ghostwriter can do the work of mediocre developer, but they have a massive potential to duck up and largely waste more time because of the confabulations. You can glance hackernews to learn some horror stories.You're bold about attempting to guesstimate the metrics of adoption but without analysis of gain by competition or downstream companies that use AI models, those numbers are hard to justify.https://scale.com/leaderboardAPI TPS increase does not mean more usage. That massive scale is more of a requirement for any large scale infrastructure provider. AWS/GCP set the same kind of requirements for their services.I'm hopeful about longer term growth but hyping the short term gains will disappoint when the earnings are not ""monster"" in size.",0,0.531,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"This might be one of Microsoft's most influential quarters in quite some time. The main argument for my thesis is OpenAI and recent AI model upgrades from in the form of GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-o1, and GPT-o1-mini. As well, I don't know if anyone noticed their Uranium portfolio's going through the roof but if not check out SMR, OKLO and others to see more. AI needs so much power that they are opening up defunct nuclear power plants on 3-mile island in Pennsylvania for new energy sources. What most media types don't have a window into, mostly I assume this because they keep saying the same silly thing over and over again, is that enterprise is using AI. AI is not going to come in the form of a ""killer app"". The killer app is ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Mistral. Those are the killer apps but those are also not important things in the AI arms race. AI in and of in itself is the killer app. The reason for this is that it commoditized intelligence in the form of tokens that can be literally bought and sold through the cloud. When certain media types keep railing on the notion that ""who's making money with this"" they are missing the reality in that people are making money with this each and every day. The enterprise is creating applications that are simply not understood by everyday people or analysts because there not the ""killer apps"" that people think of which represents mostly something popular that teenagers and young adults are into. Is Venmo a killer app? Is Facebook a killer apps still? I don't know maybe I'm just not with the times. What i do know is that is that AI is so large and so democratized that the use cases, while not killer, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in the enterprise setting. This is the fast and steady drum beat of GAI increasingly taking over all human cognitive tasks. It won't happen overnight but it is happening. I think what is happening with the media is that they can't put a metric to it so I will attempt to. AI adoption and penetration into everyday processes and tasks for enterprise is probably at 0.6%-1%. If you include the backlog of potential AI penetration it is probably 2 - 5% of all enterprise tasks and processes. The immediate 1 - 2 year outlook of AI penetration is probably 1 - 3% with a backlog of 6-9%. To be clear, I am not considering productivity gains because who the hell cares about any of that. I am specifically speaking about cold hard ROI of implementing an AI automation system and having that AI do the work that was once a human task now offloading to an AI automation task. I don't know how you feel about the above numbers but in my interpretation it is incredibly slow but growth can be incredibly exponential in relatively a short amount of time. The reason, I've written about this many times before, is because the data is not ready, the talent is not there to reconstruct and rebuild what needs to be in place to make efficient data process that are specific to AI, and many many other factors. This is why consulting through the likes of Accenture, Palantir, IBM and others will be very important in the coming years. It's my opinion that companies now matter how large or small won't be able to put in the right processes without proven practices that will foster from consultancy groups rather than at home grown talent. However, there will be clues of how well the progress is going. An AI channel check if you will. AI Channel Check through Microsoft Azure: Microsoft provides this channel check for us. Alphabet just completed their channel check and the news on AI was good. Continued spending for all things AI and healthy numbers in their core businesses to justify the continued spend. I look for Microsoft to report much in the same way in terms of AI CapEx/Spend. 2 quarters ago Microsoft started reporting the AI portion of their Azure Cloud revenues. 2 quarters ago it was 6%, and the previous quarter it rose to 7%. For their earnings report tomorrow the AI revenue should be in the 10-12% range. In my opinion 8% is not going to cut it. 1% quarterly gain seems slow. The number in aggregate should be 2%+ quarter to quarter growth. In this way, 1% isn't going to cut it for Wall Street. Perhaps we do see 8%-9% next quarter and that wouldn't be a horrible thing but if Microsoft wants to blow the doors off of earnings and reestablish a healthy growth pattern it is of my opinion that number of percent AI revenue shares needs a meaningful bps up. I believe that in this earnings there will be that meaningful click upwards of AI percentage growth for Microsoft in the 10%+ range. 11% would be a bust out surprise and 12% would be significantly positive. So where is this possible 3% rise in AI revenue growth coming from? Look no further than GPT-4o. GPT-4o and the AI Number Gpt-4o was initially released on May 13, 2024. For reference, Microsoft's last quarter was, Q4 2024, ended on June 30, 2024, with earnings reported on July 30, 2024. AI number 7%.

When does SMCI report again?","Great response. It's a much more muted tone of expectation. I don't agree but lol it's a great counter argument.One thing that I will agree with you is that effectively the intelligence has to get smarter, the throughput for that has to adjust upwards and so on. This is going to be a 3 - 6 years long process surely.My argument is that this quarter has to show the meaningful double digit AI Number. It may not happen this quarter and I personally think the market will not look kindly to that. 1% qoq improvements won't be looked kindly upon. However, the throughput here is significant. You say it doesn't matter but it does. It's not even so much the actual throughput but the reality that the latency is so much improved that the throughput is actually feasible. I have projects in production and scaling in production and we have studied this exact issue at length. When the throughput gained momentum as you see in my post we no longer worried about that issue any longer. In this way, it was an unlocking. I can't be the only person / team thinking the same exact thing.The projects that were POC'd are now entering into production and being scaled. Again, it may not be this quarter but they A. they better have an ultra good reason as to why not. B. Guide that in the next quarter double digit AI Number is in play.I do like your information regarding intelligence as a depreciating asset but that is a tad silly. the models are largely plug and play. In an AI pipeline it is not much work to upgrade to new models when they are ready. Yes it is a little be retreading but again the expectation is that increasingly that will become less and less over time.If your project is Tier 1 you will account for that. Tier 2, 3 it's much less important. What would be interesting is if Microsoft did address how many Tier 1 applications they are seeing throughout various organizations. Of course they won't but that is the real metric worth noting.",1,0.528,POSITIVE,0.966

This is where I believe the AI number from Microsoft will materially increase. Let's take a look. First, let's start with GPT-4-Turbo which was released November 6, 2023. Git Commit e477326: Commit e477326 was dated to Nov 22, 2023. A preview was available, 1106, as of Nov 17, 2023. Using this as a ground truth you can see that the token limit is 134k per minute with a max of 2.7 K requests per minute. this and surely prior to this was hell on enterprises to do any meaningful work with the models. It was great for experimenting and getting started but not for meaningful production work. GPT-4o was released on May 13, 2024. Git Commit 431bb24: Commit 431bb24 was dated to May 20, 2024. As you can see from previous GPT-4 capacity limitations GPT-4o introduced a massive improvement for quota limit TPM and requests per minute RPM. This is a significant release for enterprise customers as they can now begin to plan, develop, and execute AI software stacks into production environments. 60 K RPM's is a 22X upgrade towards production throughput. Git Commit 30084ae: Commit 30084ae was dated July 24, 2024. In this update the quota TPM was raised from 10M to 30M tokens per minute. Current Quota Limits: In the current quota limits there is a 180 K RPM increase from 60 K. At this point and earlier in the quarter OpenAI's GPT-4o models became capacity unlocked. There is nothing you cannot do or plan for in terms of AI model integrations, TPM's, or RPM throughput. At this moment, intelligence is untethered from any api constraints. What you can imagine building in terms of AI and LLMs and the delivery of those products and services can be fully realized without constraint. If you go from the beginning analysis of GPT-4-Turbo until today there is a 223X tokens per minute (TPM) increase and a 66.66X request per minute (RPM) increase. This is a massive throughput gain that cannot be expressed enough of how significant this is in terms of AI advancements regarding enterprise adoption. This is why I believe the AI Number finally breaks the double digits in this quarter of 10%+. Ever since the last quarter ended, June 30, 2024, there has been a steady stream of AI model improvements and api throughput improvements that are significant in scope.

I think what is happening with the media is that they can't put a metric to it so I will attempt to. AI adoption and penetration into everyday processes and tasks for enterprise is probably at 0.6%-1%. If you include the backlog of potential AI penetration it is probably 2 - 5% of all enterprise tasks and processes. The immediate 1 - 2 year outlook of AI penetration is probably 1 - 3% with a backlog of 6-9%. To be clear, I am not considering productivity gains because who the hell cares about any of that. I am specifically speaking about cold hard ROI of implementing an AI automation system and having that AI do the work that was once a human task now offloading to an AI automation task. I don't know how you feel about the above numbers but in my interpretation it is incredibly slow but growth can be incredibly exponential in relatively a short amount of time. The reason, I've written about this many times before, is because the data is not ready, the talent is not there to reconstruct and rebuild what needs to be in place to make efficient data process that are specific to AI, and many many other factors. This is why consulting through the likes of Accenture, Palantir, IBM and others will be very important in the coming years. It's my opinion that companies now matter how large or small won't be able to put in the right processes without proven practices that will foster from consultancy groups rather than at home grown talent. However, there will be clues of how well the progress is going. An AI channel check if you will. AI Channel Check through Microsoft Azure: Microsoft provides this channel check for us. Alphabet just completed their channel check and the news on AI was good. Continued spending for all things AI and healthy numbers in their core businesses to justify the continued spend. I look for Microsoft to report much in the same way in terms of AI CapEx/Spend. 2 quarters ago Microsoft started reporting the AI portion of their Azure Cloud revenues. 2 quarters ago it was 6%, and the previous quarter it rose to 7%. For their earnings report tomorrow the AI revenue should be in the 10-12% range. In my opinion 8% is not going to cut it. 1% quarterly gain seems slow. The number in aggregate should be 2%+ quarter to quarter growth. In this way, 1% isn't going to cut it for Wall Street. Perhaps we do see 8%-9% next quarter and that wouldn't be a horrible thing but if Microsoft wants to blow the doors off of earnings and reestablish a healthy growth pattern it is of my opinion that number of percent AI revenue shares needs a meaningful bps up. I believe that in this earnings there will be that meaningful click upwards of AI percentage growth for Microsoft in the 10%+ range. 11% would be a bust out surprise and 12% would be significantly positive. So where is this possible 3% rise in AI revenue growth coming from? Look no further than GPT-4o. GPT-4o and the AI Number Gpt-4o was initially released on May 13, 2024. For reference, Microsoft's last quarter was, Q4 2024, ended on June 30, 2024, with earnings reported on July 30, 2024. AI number 7%. There was no way for GPT-4o to significantly penetrate into their earnings with only roughly 30 days of usage. If you take into account the iterations of 4o itself the model initially was met with skepticism (compared to GPT-4-Turbo) and apprehension until subsequent versions of 4o were released. All-in-all, there is no way GPT-4o was going to be in the previous quarters (Q4) earnings report. However, what's even more interesting is the increase in quota and throughput of GPT-4 to GPT-4o. This is where I believe the AI number from Microsoft will materially increase. Let's take a look. First, let's start with GPT-4-Turbo which was released November 6, 2023. Git Commit e477326: Commit e477326 was dated to Nov 22, 2023. A preview was available, 1106, as of Nov 17, 2023. Using this as a ground truth you can see that the token limit is 134k per minute with a max of 2.7 K requests per minute. this and surely prior to this was hell on enterprises to do any meaningful work with the models. It was great for experimenting and getting started but not for meaningful production work. GPT-4o was released on May 13, 2024. Git Commit 431bb24: Commit 431bb24 was dated to May 20, 2024. As you can see from previous GPT-4 capacity limitations GPT-4o introduced a massive improvement for quota limit TPM and requests per minute RPM. This is a significant release for enterprise customers as they can now begin to plan, develop, and execute AI software stacks into production environments. 60 K RPM's is a 22X upgrade towards production throughput. Git Commit 30084ae: Commit 30084ae was dated July 24, 2024. In this update the quota TPM was raised from 10M to 30M tokens per minute. Current Quota Limits: In the current quota limits there is a 180 K RPM increase from 60 K. At this point and earlier in the quarter OpenAI's GPT-4o models became capacity unlocked. There is nothing you cannot do or plan for in terms of AI model integrations, TPM's, or RPM throughput. At this moment, intelligence is untethered from any api constraints. What you can imagine building in terms of AI and LLMs and the delivery of those products and services can be fully realized without constraint. If you go from the beginning analysis of GPT-4-Turbo until today there is a 223X tokens per minute (TPM) increase and a 66.66X request per minute (RPM) increase. This is a massive throughput gain that cannot be expressed enough of how significant this is in terms of AI advancements regarding enterprise adoption. This is why I believe the AI Number finally breaks the double digits in this quarter of 10%+. Ever since the last quarter ended, June 30, 2024, there has been a steady stream of AI model improvements and api throughput improvements that are significant in scope. If you couple this with Google's continued AI spend and quality quarter, AI hardware channel checks that verify the AI hardware spend, and a github repo commit history that shows nothing but blazing improvements for Microsoft Azure intelligence; It could not be more clear to me that Microsoft is executing on all levels and should deliver a potentially monster quarter.

Using this as a ground truth you can see that the token limit is 134k per minute with a max of 2.7 K requests per minute. this and surely prior to this was hell on enterprises to do any meaningful work with the models. It was great for experimenting and getting started but not for meaningful production work. GPT-4o was released on May 13, 2024. Git Commit 431bb24: Commit 431bb24 was dated to May 20, 2024. As you can see from previous GPT-4 capacity limitations GPT-4o introduced a massive improvement for quota limit TPM and requests per minute RPM. This is a significant release for enterprise customers as they can now begin to plan, develop, and execute AI software stacks into production environments. 60 K RPM's is a 22X upgrade towards production throughput. Git Commit 30084ae: Commit 30084ae was dated July 24, 2024. In this update the quota TPM was raised from 10M to 30M tokens per minute. Current Quota Limits: In the current quota limits there is a 180 K RPM increase from 60 K. At this point and earlier in the quarter OpenAI's GPT-4o models became capacity unlocked. There is nothing you cannot do or plan for in terms of AI model integrations, TPM's, or RPM throughput. At this moment, intelligence is untethered from any api constraints. What you can imagine building in terms of AI and LLMs and the delivery of those products and services can be fully realized without constraint. If you go from the beginning analysis of GPT-4-Turbo until today there is a 223X tokens per minute (TPM) increase and a 66.66X request per minute (RPM) increase. This is a massive throughput gain that cannot be expressed enough of how significant this is in terms of AI advancements regarding enterprise adoption. This is why I believe the AI Number finally breaks the double digits in this quarter of 10%+. Ever since the last quarter ended, June 30, 2024, there has been a steady stream of AI model improvements and api throughput improvements that are significant in scope. If you couple this with Google's continued AI spend and quality quarter, AI hardware channel checks that verify the AI hardware spend, and a github repo commit history that shows nothing but blazing improvements for Microsoft Azure intelligence; It could not be more clear to me that Microsoft is executing on all levels and should deliver a potentially monster quarter. Not that it needs it but here is the plug for NVDA as well. All of those github commits and throughput improvements are directly related to Microsoft bringing data centers online all over the world. This is insane! I don't have to tell you the git commits for this graph are absolutely bonkers too. I have shares in MSFT, NVDA, ARM, VRT, and 1 share of SMCI.

,"This might be one of Microsoft's most influential quarters in quite some time. The main argument for my thesis is OpenAI and recent AI model upgrades from in the form of GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-o1, and GPT-o1-mini. As well, I don't know if anyone noticed their Uranium portfolio's going through the roof but if not check out SMR, OKLO and others to see more. AI needs so much power that they are opening up defunct nuclear power plants on 3-mile island in Pennsylvania for new energy sources. What most media types don't have a window into, mostly I assume this because they keep saying the same silly thing over and over again, is that enterprise is using AI. AI is not going to come in the form of a ""killer app"". The killer app is ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Mistral. Those are the killer apps but those are also not important things in the AI arms race. AI in and of in itself is the killer app. The reason for this is that it commoditized intelligence in the form of tokens that can be literally bought and sold through the cloud. When certain media types keep railing on the notion that ""who's making money with this"" they are missing the reality in that people are making money with this each and every day. The enterprise is creating applications that are simply not understood by everyday people or analysts because there not the ""killer apps"" that people think of which represents mostly something popular that teenagers and young adults are into. Is Venmo a killer app? Is Facebook a killer apps still? I don't know maybe I'm just not with the times. What i do know is that is that AI is so large and so democratized that the use cases, while not killer, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in the enterprise setting. This is the fast and steady drum beat of GAI increasingly taking over all human cognitive tasks. It won't happen overnight but it is happening. I think what is happening with the media is that they can't put a metric to it so I will attempt to. AI adoption and penetration into everyday processes and tasks for enterprise is probably at 0.6%-1%. If you include the backlog of potential AI penetration it is probably 2 - 5% of all enterprise tasks and processes. The immediate 1 - 2 year outlook of AI penetration is probably 1 - 3% with a backlog of 6-9%. To be clear, I am not considering productivity gains because who the hell cares about any of that. I am specifically speaking about cold hard ROI of implementing an AI automation system and having that AI do the work that was once a human task now offloading to an AI automation task. I don't know how you feel about the above numbers but in my interpretation it is incredibly slow but growth can be incredibly exponential in relatively a short amount of time. The reason, I've written about this many times before, is because the data is not ready, the talent is not there to reconstruct and rebuild what needs to be in place to make efficient data process that are specific to AI, and many many other factors. This is why consulting through the likes of Accenture, Palantir, IBM and others will be very important in the coming years. It's my opinion that companies now matter how large or small won't be able to put in the right processes without proven practices that will foster from consultancy groups rather than at home grown talent. However, there will be clues of how well the progress is going. An AI channel check if you will. AI Channel Check through Microsoft Azure: Microsoft provides this channel check for us. Alphabet just completed their channel check and the news on AI was good. Continued spending for all things AI and healthy numbers in their core businesses to justify the continued spend. I look for Microsoft to report much in the same way in terms of AI CapEx/Spend. 2 quarters ago Microsoft started reporting the AI portion of their Azure Cloud revenues. 2 quarters ago it was 6%, and the previous quarter it rose to 7%. For their earnings report tomorrow the AI revenue should be in the 10-12% range. In my opinion 8% is not going to cut it. 1% quarterly gain seems slow. The number in aggregate should be 2%+ quarter to quarter growth. In this way, 1% isn't going to cut it for Wall Street. Perhaps we do see 8%-9% next quarter and that wouldn't be a horrible thing but if Microsoft wants to blow the doors off of earnings and reestablish a healthy growth pattern it is of my opinion that number of percent AI revenue shares needs a meaningful bps up. I believe that in this earnings there will be that meaningful click upwards of AI percentage growth for Microsoft in the 10%+ range. 11% would be a bust out surprise and 12% would be significantly positive. So where is this possible 3% rise in AI revenue growth coming from? Look no further than GPT-4o. GPT-4o and the AI Number Gpt-4o was initially released on May 13, 2024. For reference, Microsoft's last quarter was, Q4 2024, ended on June 30, 2024, with earnings reported on July 30, 2024. AI number 7%. There was no way for GPT-4o to significantly penetrate into their earnings with only roughly 30 days of usage. If you take into account the iterations of 4o itself the model initially was met with skepticism (compared to GPT-4-Turbo) and apprehension until subsequent versions of 4o were released. All-in-all, there is no way GPT-4o was going to be in the previous quarters (Q4) earnings report. However, what's even more interesting is the increase in quota and throughput of GPT-4 to GPT-4o.

The number in aggregate should be 2%+ quarter to quarter growth. In this way, 1% isn't going to cut it for Wall Street. Perhaps we do see 8%-9% next quarter and that wouldn't be a horrible thing but if Microsoft wants to blow the doors off of earnings and reestablish a healthy growth pattern it is of my opinion that number of percent AI revenue shares needs a meaningful bps up. I believe that in this earnings there will be that meaningful click upwards of AI percentage growth for Microsoft in the 10%+ range. 11% would be a bust out surprise and 12% would be significantly positive. So where is this possible 3% rise in AI revenue growth coming from? Look no further than GPT-4o. GPT-4o and the AI Number Gpt-4o was initially released on May 13, 2024. For reference, Microsoft's last quarter was, Q4 2024, ended on June 30, 2024, with earnings reported on July 30, 2024. AI number 7%. There was no way for GPT-4o to significantly penetrate into their earnings with only roughly 30 days of usage. If you take into account the iterations of 4o itself the model initially was met with skepticism (compared to GPT-4-Turbo) and apprehension until subsequent versions of 4o were released. All-in-all, there is no way GPT-4o was going to be in the previous quarters (Q4) earnings report. However, what's even more interesting is the increase in quota and throughput of GPT-4 to GPT-4o. This is where I believe the AI number from Microsoft will materially increase. Let's take a look. First, let's start with GPT-4-Turbo which was released November 6, 2023. Git Commit e477326: Commit e477326 was dated to Nov 22, 2023. A preview was available, 1106, as of Nov 17, 2023. Using this as a ground truth you can see that the token limit is 134k per minute with a max of 2.7 K requests per minute. this and surely prior to this was hell on enterprises to do any meaningful work with the models. It was great for experimenting and getting started but not for meaningful production work. GPT-4o was released on May 13, 2024. Git Commit 431bb24: Commit 431bb24 was dated to May 20, 2024. As you can see from previous GPT-4 capacity limitations GPT-4o introduced a massive improvement for quota limit TPM and requests per minute RPM. This is a significant release for enterprise customers as they can now begin to plan, develop, and execute AI software stacks into production environments. 60 K RPM's is a 22X upgrade towards production throughput. Git Commit 30084ae: Commit 30084ae was dated July 24, 2024. In this update the quota TPM was raised from 10M to 30M tokens per minute. Current Quota Limits: In the current quota limits there is a 180 K RPM increase from 60 K. At this point and earlier in the quarter OpenAI's GPT-4o models became capacity unlocked. There is nothing you cannot do or plan for in terms of AI model integrations, TPM's, or RPM throughput. At this moment, intelligence is untethered from any api constraints. What you can imagine building in terms of AI and LLMs and the delivery of those products and services can be fully realized without constraint. If you go from the beginning analysis of GPT-4-Turbo until today there is a 223X tokens per minute (TPM) increase and a 66.66X request per minute (RPM) increase. This is a massive throughput gain that cannot be expressed enough of how significant this is in terms of AI advancements regarding enterprise adoption. This is why I believe the AI Number finally breaks the double digits in this quarter of 10%+. Ever since the last quarter ended, June 30, 2024, there has been a steady stream of AI model improvements and api throughput improvements that are significant in scope. If you couple this with Google's continued AI spend and quality quarter, AI hardware channel checks that verify the AI hardware spend, and a github repo commit history that shows nothing but blazing improvements for Microsoft Azure intelligence; It could not be more clear to me that Microsoft is executing on all levels and should deliver a potentially monster quarter. Not that it needs it but here is the plug for NVDA as well. All of those github commits and throughput improvements are directly related to Microsoft bringing data centers online all over the world. This is insane! I don't have to tell you the git commits for this graph are absolutely bonkers too. I have shares in MSFT, NVDA, ARM, VRT, and 1 share of SMCI.

,"This might be one of Microsoft's most influential quarters in quite some time. The main argument for my thesis is OpenAI and recent AI model upgrades from in the form of GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-o1, and GPT-o1-mini. As well, I don't know if anyone noticed their Uranium portfolio's going through the roof but if not check out SMR, OKLO and others to see more. AI needs so much power that they are opening up defunct nuclear power plants on 3-mile island in Pennsylvania for new energy sources. What most media types don't have a window into, mostly I assume this because they keep saying the same silly thing over and over again, is that enterprise is using AI. AI is not going to come in the form of a ""killer app"". The killer app is ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Mistral. Those are the killer apps but those are also not important things in the AI arms race. AI in and of in itself is the killer app. The reason for this is that it commoditized intelligence in the form of tokens that can be literally bought and sold through the cloud. When certain media types keep railing on the notion that ""who's making money with this"" they are missing the reality in that people are making money with this each and every day. The enterprise is creating applications that are simply not understood by everyday people or analysts because there not the ""killer apps"" that people think of which represents mostly something popular that teenagers and young adults are into. Is Venmo a killer app? Is Facebook a killer apps still? I don't know maybe I'm just not with the times. What i do know is that is that AI is so large and so democratized that the use cases, while not killer, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in the enterprise setting. This is the fast and steady drum beat of GAI increasingly taking over all human cognitive tasks. It won't happen overnight but it is happening. I think what is happening with the media is that they can't put a metric to it so I will attempt to. AI adoption and penetration into everyday processes and tasks for enterprise is probably at 0.6%-1%. If you include the backlog of potential AI penetration it is probably 2 - 5% of all enterprise tasks and processes. The immediate 1 - 2 year outlook of AI penetration is probably 1 - 3% with a backlog of 6-9%. To be clear, I am not considering productivity gains because who the hell cares about any of that. I am specifically speaking about cold hard ROI of implementing an AI automation system and having that AI do the work that was once a human task now offloading to an AI automation task. I don't know how you feel about the above numbers but in my interpretation it is incredibly slow but growth can be incredibly exponential in relatively a short amount of time. The reason, I've written about this many times before, is because the data is not ready, the talent is not there to reconstruct and rebuild what needs to be in place to make efficient data process that are specific to AI, and many many other factors. This is why consulting through the likes of Accenture, Palantir, IBM and others will be very important in the coming years. It's my opinion that companies now matter how large or small won't be able to put in the right processes without proven practices that will foster from consultancy groups rather than at home grown talent. However, there will be clues of how well the progress is going. An AI channel check if you will. AI Channel Check through Microsoft Azure: Microsoft provides this channel check for us. Alphabet just completed their channel check and the news on AI was good. Continued spending for all things AI and healthy numbers in their core businesses to justify the continued spend.
