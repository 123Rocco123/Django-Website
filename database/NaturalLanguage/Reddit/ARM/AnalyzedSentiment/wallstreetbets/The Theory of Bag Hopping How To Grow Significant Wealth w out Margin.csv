,"One of the most discouraging things I keep seeing on Reddit is investor after investor boasting about how margin, or playing with borrowed money, helped them grow the number of zeroes in their brokerage account. I agree, this is an intoxicating thought, but does the new investor realize that most of the Reddit accounts that are blown up overnight have the same thing in common? Yes, playing with margin can significantly increase your wealth, but there is also a 100% certainty that it will tear your arm off when stocks are plummeting. This is why trading inside retirement accounts is so beneficial to the everyday Joe. Not only are all his gains sheltered from taxes, which allows him to compound his gains over and over again without having to pay the government every time he sells, but most retirement accounts don’t allow trading on margin. When I was a new investor, I thought this little fun fact was a huge inconvenience. But what I learned is that not trading with borrowed money gives the investor a huge opportunity to “bag hop,” which is how I grew $97k to more than $2M in less than two years. Let me explain. My whole bag-hopping theory centers around the new investor who stays out of the market and hoards more and more cash until there’s a huge Black Swan event, which historically, occurs about every 6-8 years. You’ve only got to get rich once, so by staying out of the market and building cash reserves, the investor can maximize their “utility” by entering a bear market with the maximum amount of dry powder. A huge clearing event can be easily recognized by the VIX, “The Volatility Index/Fear Index,” spiking above 50. When Covid lockdowns halted the global economy, the VIX actually spiked above 60. And on this single event, with only $75,000, I went on a buying spree that eventually led me to structure my portfolio in way to that rapidly compounded my gains without using margin. The only caveat is this whole idea can only be safely executed with a huge margin of safety, which means, the investor must wait until there’s a major clearing event before entering the market. If the investor tried to do this in today’s economy, which is nearing the third year of a bull market, they would likely get crushed because today’s nosebleed valuations offer no protection to the downside and very little opportunity to stack bags. So here it is…. Let’s say Susie has $100k and sees the VIX spike above 50, picks up the Wall Street Journal, and finds 10 stocks that are trading 90% off their 52-week highs. For the sake of simplicity, we’ll say all of these 10 stocks are $20 stocks that are now on sale for $2. So, with 10 good ideas, and a huge margin of safety built into each undervalued stock, the Susie deploys her $100k evenly across a basket of table-pounding buys, which give her 5,000 shares of each company. After three months, some stocks are stuck, some stocks are cheaper, and some stocks have bounced off their 52-week lows for 300% gains. The question is, what’s more likely: stocks E & H doubling again in the next three months, or stocks C & J returning to their $2 entry point? Clearly, it’s a lot easier for C&J to come back to $2 before E & H hit $12, so Susie the savvy investor banks the bags and rolls all that profit into C & J. Her basket is now full of 8 stocks instead of 10. Then, three months later, A & F are leading the portfolio with $300% gains while G is still stuck. Again, what is more likely, A & F get to $12, or G simply jumps from $2 to $4? Knowing the odds are far better for G to increase to $4, Susie banks the bags on A & F, then rolls all that profit into G. Now, she has a 6-stock basket. Half of those have 35,000 shares, and the half only have 5,000. But even though her basket is lopsided, all she has to do is wait. And 2 years later, if Susie’s 6 stocks return to their all-time highs of $20, she turns $100k into $2.4 million. If she doesn’t bag hop and sticks with her 10 initial purchases of 5000 shares each, her portfolio grows only 10x from $100k to $1M. More money. Less risk. No margin. Any thoughts? I’m curious if there’s any other folks who have tried this with their own portfolio….          ","TLDRTicker: N/A (Strategy focuses on undervalued stocks across various sectors)Direction: Buy low, sell high during a market crash.Prognosis: Potentially high returns, but requires patience and significant risk tolerance. Only invest what you can afford to lose completely!Strategy: ""Bag Hopping"" - Invest heavily during a major market crash (VIX > 50) in a diversified basket of deeply undervalued stocks. As some stocks recover, sell and reinvest those profits into the remaining underperforming stocks. Repeat until the market recovers.Caveats: This strategy is extremely risky and requires a high risk tolerance and the ability to withstand significant volatility. It also necessitates a very long time horizon and significant patience. Timing the market is notoriously difficult.",0,0.541,NEGATIVE,0.997

Not only are all his gains sheltered from taxes, which allows him to compound his gains over and over again without having to pay the government every time he sells, but most retirement accounts don’t allow trading on margin. When I was a new investor, I thought this little fun fact was a huge inconvenience. But what I learned is that not trading with borrowed money gives the investor a huge opportunity to “bag hop,” which is how I grew $97k to more than $2M in less than two years. Let me explain. My whole bag-hopping theory centers around the new investor who stays out of the market and hoards more and more cash until there’s a huge Black Swan event, which historically, occurs about every 6-8 years. You’ve only got to get rich once, so by staying out of the market and building cash reserves, the investor can maximize their “utility” by entering a bear market with the maximum amount of dry powder. A huge clearing event can be easily recognized by the VIX, “The Volatility Index/Fear Index,” spiking above 50. When Covid lockdowns halted the global economy, the VIX actually spiked above 60. And on this single event, with only $75,000, I went on a buying spree that eventually led me to structure my portfolio in way to that rapidly compounded my gains without using margin. The only caveat is this whole idea can only be safely executed with a huge margin of safety, which means, the investor must wait until there’s a major clearing event before entering the market. If the investor tried to do this in today’s economy, which is nearing the third year of a bull market, they would likely get crushed because today’s nosebleed valuations offer no protection to the downside and very little opportunity to stack bags. So here it is…. Let’s say Susie has $100k and sees the VIX spike above 50, picks up the Wall Street Journal, and finds 10 stocks that are trading 90% off their 52-week highs. For the sake of simplicity, we’ll say all of these 10 stocks are $20 stocks that are now on sale for $2. So, with 10 good ideas, and a huge margin of safety built into each undervalued stock, the Susie deploys her $100k evenly across a basket of table-pounding buys, which give her 5,000 shares of each company. After three months, some stocks are stuck, some stocks are cheaper, and some stocks have bounced off their 52-week lows for 300% gains. The question is, what’s more likely: stocks E & H doubling again in the next three months, or stocks C & J returning to their $2 entry point? Clearly, it’s a lot easier for C&J to come back to $2 before E & H hit $12, so Susie the savvy investor banks the bags and rolls all that profit into C & J. Her basket is now full of 8 stocks instead of 10. Then, three months later, A & F are leading the portfolio with $300% gains while G is still stuck. Again, what is more likely, A & F get to $12, or G simply jumps from $2 to $4? Knowing the odds are far better for G to increase to $4, Susie banks the bags on A & F, then rolls all that profit into G. Now, she has a 6-stock basket. Half of those have 35,000 shares, and the half only have 5,000. But even though her basket is lopsided, all she has to do is wait. And 2 years later, if Susie’s 6 stocks return to their all-time highs of $20, she turns $100k into $2.4 million. If she doesn’t bag hop and sticks with her 10 initial purchases of 5000 shares each, her portfolio grows only 10x from $100k to $1M. More money. Less risk. No margin. Any thoughts? I’m curious if there’s any other folks who have tried this with their own portfolio….          ",Don't just circle the drain dive right in.,2,0.504,NEGATIVE,0.981

A huge clearing event can be easily recognized by the VIX, “The Volatility Index/Fear Index,” spiking above 50. When Covid lockdowns halted the global economy, the VIX actually spiked above 60. And on this single event, with only $75,000, I went on a buying spree that eventually led me to structure my portfolio in way to that rapidly compounded my gains without using margin. The only caveat is this whole idea can only be safely executed with a huge margin of safety, which means, the investor must wait until there’s a major clearing event before entering the market. If the investor tried to do this in today’s economy, which is nearing the third year of a bull market, they would likely get crushed because today’s nosebleed valuations offer no protection to the downside and very little opportunity to stack bags. So here it is…. Let’s say Susie has $100k and sees the VIX spike above 50, picks up the Wall Street Journal, and finds 10 stocks that are trading 90% off their 52-week highs. For the sake of simplicity, we’ll say all of these 10 stocks are $20 stocks that are now on sale for $2. So, with 10 good ideas, and a huge margin of safety built into each undervalued stock, the Susie deploys her $100k evenly across a basket of table-pounding buys, which give her 5,000 shares of each company. After three months, some stocks are stuck, some stocks are cheaper, and some stocks have bounced off their 52-week lows for 300% gains. The question is, what’s more likely: stocks E & H doubling again in the next three months, or stocks C & J returning to their $2 entry point? Clearly, it’s a lot easier for C&J to come back to $2 before E & H hit $12, so Susie the savvy investor banks the bags and rolls all that profit into C & J. Her basket is now full of 8 stocks instead of 10. Then, three months later, A & F are leading the portfolio with $300% gains while G is still stuck. Again, what is more likely, A & F get to $12, or G simply jumps from $2 to $4? Knowing the odds are far better for G to increase to $4, Susie banks the bags on A & F, then rolls all that profit into G. Now, she has a 6-stock basket. Half of those have 35,000 shares, and the half only have 5,000. But even though her basket is lopsided, all she has to do is wait. And 2 years later, if Susie’s 6 stocks return to their all-time highs of $20, she turns $100k into $2.4 million. If she doesn’t bag hop and sticks with her 10 initial purchases of 5000 shares each, her portfolio grows only 10x from $100k to $1M. More money. Less risk. No margin. Any thoughts? I’m curious if there’s any other folks who have tried this with their own portfolio….

,"One of the most discouraging things I keep seeing on Reddit is investor after investor boasting about how margin, or playing with borrowed money, helped them grow the number of zeroes in their brokerage account.

If the investor tried to do this in today’s economy, which is nearing the third year of a bull market, they would likely get crushed because today’s nosebleed valuations offer no protection to the downside and very little opportunity to stack bags. So here it is…. Let’s say Susie has $100k and sees the VIX spike above 50, picks up the Wall Street Journal, and finds 10 stocks that are trading 90% off their 52-week highs. For the sake of simplicity, we’ll say all of these 10 stocks are $20 stocks that are now on sale for $2. So, with 10 good ideas, and a huge margin of safety built into each undervalued stock, the Susie deploys her $100k evenly across a basket of table-pounding buys, which give her 5,000 shares of each company. After three months, some stocks are stuck, some stocks are cheaper, and some stocks have bounced off their 52-week lows for 300% gains. The question is, what’s more likely: stocks E & H doubling again in the next three months, or stocks C & J returning to their $2 entry point? Clearly, it’s a lot easier for C&J to come back to $2 before E & H hit $12, so Susie the savvy investor banks the bags and rolls all that profit into C & J. Her basket is now full of 8 stocks instead of 10. Then, three months later, A & F are leading the portfolio with $300% gains while G is still stuck. Again, what is more likely, A & F get to $12, or G simply jumps from $2 to $4? Knowing the odds are far better for G to increase to $4, Susie banks the bags on A & F, then rolls all that profit into G. Now, she has a 6-stock basket. Half of those have 35,000 shares, and the half only have 5,000. But even though her basket is lopsided, all she has to do is wait. And 2 years later, if Susie’s 6 stocks return to their all-time highs of $20, she turns $100k into $2.4 million. If she doesn’t bag hop and sticks with her 10 initial purchases of 5000 shares each, her portfolio grows only 10x from $100k to $1M. More money. Less risk. No margin. Any thoughts? I’m curious if there’s any other folks who have tried this with their own portfolio….

,"One of the most discouraging things I keep seeing on Reddit is investor after investor boasting about how margin, or playing with borrowed money, helped them grow the number of zeroes in their brokerage account. I agree, this is an intoxicating thought, but does the new investor realize that most of the Reddit accounts that are blown up overnight have the same thing in common? Yes, playing with margin can significantly increase your wealth, but there is also a 100% certainty that it will tear your arm off when stocks are plummeting. This is why trading inside retirement accounts is so beneficial to the everyday Joe. Not only are all his gains sheltered from taxes, which allows him to compound his gains over and over again without having to pay the government every time he sells, but most retirement accounts don’t allow trading on margin. When I was a new investor, I thought this little fun fact was a huge inconvenience. But what I learned is that not trading with borrowed money gives the investor a huge opportunity to “bag hop,” which is how I grew $97k to more than $2M in less than two years. Let me explain. My whole bag-hopping theory centers around the new investor who stays out of the market and hoards more and more cash until there’s a huge Black Swan event, which historically, occurs about every 6-8 years. You’ve only got to get rich once, so by staying out of the market and building cash reserves, the investor can maximize their “utility” by entering a bear market with the maximum amount of dry powder. A huge clearing event can be easily recognized by the VIX, “The Volatility Index/Fear Index,” spiking above 50. When Covid lockdowns halted the global economy, the VIX actually spiked above 60.

So here it is…. Let’s say Susie has $100k and sees the VIX spike above 50, picks up the Wall Street Journal, and finds 10 stocks that are trading 90% off their 52-week highs. For the sake of simplicity, we’ll say all of these 10 stocks are $20 stocks that are now on sale for $2. So, with 10 good ideas, and a huge margin of safety built into each undervalued stock, the Susie deploys her $100k evenly across a basket of table-pounding buys, which give her 5,000 shares of each company. After three months, some stocks are stuck, some stocks are cheaper, and some stocks have bounced off their 52-week lows for 300% gains. The question is, what’s more likely: stocks E & H doubling again in the next three months, or stocks C & J returning to their $2 entry point? Clearly, it’s a lot easier for C&J to come back to $2 before E & H hit $12, so Susie the savvy investor banks the bags and rolls all that profit into C & J. Her basket is now full of 8 stocks instead of 10. Then, three months later, A & F are leading the portfolio with $300% gains while G is still stuck. Again, what is more likely, A & F get to $12, or G simply jumps from $2 to $4? Knowing the odds are far better for G to increase to $4, Susie banks the bags on A & F, then rolls all that profit into G. Now, she has a 6-stock basket. Half of those have 35,000 shares, and the half only have 5,000. But even though her basket is lopsided, all she has to do is wait. And 2 years later, if Susie’s 6 stocks return to their all-time highs of $20, she turns $100k into $2.4 million. If she doesn’t bag hop and sticks with her 10 initial purchases of 5000 shares each, her portfolio grows only 10x from $100k to $1M. More money. Less risk. No margin. Any thoughts?

,"One of the most discouraging things I keep seeing on Reddit is investor after investor boasting about how margin, or playing with borrowed money, helped them grow the number of zeroes in their brokerage account. I agree, this is an intoxicating thought, but does the new investor realize that most of the Reddit accounts that are blown up overnight have the same thing in common? Yes, playing with margin can significantly increase your wealth, but there is also a 100% certainty that it will tear your arm off when stocks are plummeting.

When I was a new investor, I thought this little fun fact was a huge inconvenience. But what I learned is that not trading with borrowed money gives the investor a huge opportunity to “bag hop,” which is how I grew $97k to more than $2M in less than two years. Let me explain. My whole bag-hopping theory centers around the new investor who stays out of the market and hoards more and more cash until there’s a huge Black Swan event, which historically, occurs about every 6-8 years. You’ve only got to get rich once, so by staying out of the market and building cash reserves, the investor can maximize their “utility” by entering a bear market with the maximum amount of dry powder. A huge clearing event can be easily recognized by the VIX, “The Volatility Index/Fear Index,” spiking above 50. When Covid lockdowns halted the global economy, the VIX actually spiked above 60.

The question is, what’s more likely: stocks E & H doubling again in the next three months, or stocks C & J returning to their $2 entry point? Clearly, it’s a lot easier for C&J to come back to $2 before E & H hit $12, so Susie the savvy investor banks the bags and rolls all that profit into C & J. Her basket is now full of 8 stocks instead of 10. Then, three months later, A & F are leading the portfolio with $300% gains while G is still stuck. Again, what is more likely, A & F get to $12, or G simply jumps from $2 to $4? Knowing the odds are far better for G to increase to $4, Susie banks the bags on A & F, then rolls all that profit into G. Now, she has a 6-stock basket. Half of those have 35,000 shares, and the half only have 5,000. But even though her basket is lopsided, all she has to do is wait. And 2 years later, if Susie’s 6 stocks return to their all-time highs of $20, she turns $100k into $2.4 million. If she doesn’t bag hop and sticks with her 10 initial purchases of 5000 shares each, her portfolio grows only 10x from $100k to $1M. More money. Less risk. No margin. Any thoughts? I’m curious if there’s any other folks who have tried this with their own portfolio….

,"One of the most discouraging things I keep seeing on Reddit is investor after investor boasting about how margin, or playing with borrowed money, helped them grow the number of zeroes in their brokerage account. I agree, this is an intoxicating thought, but does the new investor realize that most of the Reddit accounts that are blown up overnight have the same thing in common? Yes, playing with margin can significantly increase your wealth, but there is also a 100% certainty that it will tear your arm off when stocks are plummeting. This is why trading inside retirement accounts is so beneficial to the everyday Joe. Not only are all his gains sheltered from taxes, which allows him to compound his gains over and over again without having to pay the government every time he sells, but most retirement accounts don’t allow trading on margin. When I was a new investor, I thought this little fun fact was a huge inconvenience. But what I learned is that not trading with borrowed money gives the investor a huge opportunity to “bag hop,” which is how I grew $97k to more than $2M in less than two years. Let me explain. My whole bag-hopping theory centers around the new investor who stays out of the market and hoards more and more cash until there’s a huge Black Swan event, which historically, occurs about every 6-8 years. You’ve only got to get rich once, so by staying out of the market and building cash reserves, the investor can maximize their “utility” by entering a bear market with the maximum amount of dry powder. A huge clearing event can be easily recognized by the VIX, “The Volatility Index/Fear Index,” spiking above 50. When Covid lockdowns halted the global economy, the VIX actually spiked above 60. And on this single event, with only $75,000, I went on a buying spree that eventually led me to structure my portfolio in way to that rapidly compounded my gains without using margin. The only caveat is this whole idea can only be safely executed with a huge margin of safety, which means, the investor must wait until there’s a major clearing event before entering the market. If the investor tried to do this in today’s economy, which is nearing the third year of a bull market, they would likely get crushed because today’s nosebleed valuations offer no protection to the downside and very little opportunity to stack bags. So here it is…. Let’s say Susie has $100k and sees the VIX spike above 50, picks up the Wall Street Journal, and finds 10 stocks that are trading 90% off their 52-week highs. For the sake of simplicity, we’ll say all of these 10 stocks are $20 stocks that are now on sale for $2. So, with 10 good ideas, and a huge margin of safety built into each undervalued stock, the Susie deploys her $100k evenly across a basket of table-pounding buys, which give her 5,000 shares of each company. After three months, some stocks are stuck, some stocks are cheaper, and some stocks have bounced off their 52-week lows for 300% gains.

Her basket is now full of 8 stocks instead of 10. Then, three months later, A & F are leading the portfolio with $300% gains while G is still stuck. Again, what is more likely, A & F get to $12, or G simply jumps from $2 to $4? Knowing the odds are far better for G to increase to $4, Susie banks the bags on A & F, then rolls all that profit into G. Now, she has a 6-stock basket. Half of those have 35,000 shares, and the half only have 5,000. But even though her basket is lopsided, all she has to do is wait. And 2 years later, if Susie’s 6 stocks return to their all-time highs of $20, she turns $100k into $2.4 million. If she doesn’t bag hop and sticks with her 10 initial purchases of 5000 shares each, her portfolio grows only 10x from $100k to $1M. More money. Less risk. No margin. Any thoughts? I’m curious if there’s any other folks who have tried this with their own portfolio….          ","I might couple your strategy with investments outside of the stock-market like real estate or gold. Those investments should be safe if a stock market crash occurs, it might even benefit them.So you have that as a major side investment and a backup, so that if that scenario occurs you can shift your backup investment into the stock market and once it recovers you just reverse and do the same.",2,0.574,NEGATIVE,0.979
,"One of the most discouraging things I keep seeing on Reddit is investor after investor boasting about how margin, or playing with borrowed money, helped them grow the number of zeroes in their brokerage account. I agree, this is an intoxicating thought, but does the new investor realize that most of the Reddit accounts that are blown up overnight have the same thing in common? Yes, playing with margin can significantly increase your wealth, but there is also a 100% certainty that it will tear your arm off when stocks are plummeting. This is why trading inside retirement accounts is so beneficial to the everyday Joe. Not only are all his gains sheltered from taxes, which allows him to compound his gains over and over again without having to pay the government every time he sells, but most retirement accounts don’t allow trading on margin. When I was a new investor, I thought this little fun fact was a huge inconvenience. But what I learned is that not trading with borrowed money gives the investor a huge opportunity to “bag hop,” which is how I grew $97k to more than $2M in less than two years. Let me explain. My whole bag-hopping theory centers around the new investor who stays out of the market and hoards more and more cash until there’s a huge Black Swan event, which historically, occurs about every 6-8 years. You’ve only got to get rich once, so by staying out of the market and building cash reserves, the investor can maximize their “utility” by entering a bear market with the maximum amount of dry powder. A huge clearing event can be easily recognized by the VIX, “The Volatility Index/Fear Index,” spiking above 50. When Covid lockdowns halted the global economy, the VIX actually spiked above 60. And on this single event, with only $75,000, I went on a buying spree that eventually led me to structure my portfolio in way to that rapidly compounded my gains without using margin. The only caveat is this whole idea can only be safely executed with a huge margin of safety, which means, the investor must wait until there’s a major clearing event before entering the market. If the investor tried to do this in today’s economy, which is nearing the third year of a bull market, they would likely get crushed because today’s nosebleed valuations offer no protection to the downside and very little opportunity to stack bags. So here it is…. Let’s say Susie has $100k and sees the VIX spike above 50, picks up the Wall Street Journal, and finds 10 stocks that are trading 90% off their 52-week highs. For the sake of simplicity, we’ll say all of these 10 stocks are $20 stocks that are now on sale for $2. So, with 10 good ideas, and a huge margin of safety built into each undervalued stock, the Susie deploys her $100k evenly across a basket of table-pounding buys, which give her 5,000 shares of each company. After three months, some stocks are stuck, some stocks are cheaper, and some stocks have bounced off their 52-week lows for 300% gains. The question is, what’s more likely: stocks E & H doubling again in the next three months, or stocks C & J returning to their $2 entry point? Clearly, it’s a lot easier for C&J to come back to $2 before E & H hit $12, so Susie the savvy investor banks the bags and rolls all that profit into C & J.

Definitely where the money is and not trading but not something to do with your full account.However in hindsight i would diversify more than 10 stocks. I think between 20 and 30 is preferable. It is a number game and with more stocks you limit the downside and increase chances to find winners.Also i don't necessarily agree with cutting the winners, because while it's true returns slow with time in my experience winners often keep winning unless it's just short squeeze with just a monthly candle and a quick fade. I'd rather cut the dead stocksThe million dollar question is how do you screen these stocks and when do you assume that the bottom is in. Do you screen stocks by thematic, patterns, revenues ?I personnaly screen stocks in hyped sectors that are in stage 1 (base) and if possible about to form a macro higher low. High ADROn another note i think leveraged ETFs such as NVD3 (nvda3x) MST3 (MSTR3x) etc can also offer massive assymetric RR if you can buy them when the underlying is close to its 200 weekly sma.

After three months, some stocks are stuck, some stocks are cheaper, and some stocks have bounced off their 52-week lows for 300% gains. The question is, what’s more likely: stocks E & H doubling again in the next three months, or stocks C & J returning to their $2 entry point? Clearly, it’s a lot easier for C&J to come back to $2 before E & H hit $12, so Susie the savvy investor banks the bags and rolls all that profit into C & J. Her basket is now full of 8 stocks instead of 10. Then, three months later, A & F are leading the portfolio with $300% gains while G is still stuck. Again, what is more likely, A & F get to $12, or G simply jumps from $2 to $4? Knowing the odds are far better for G to increase to $4, Susie banks the bags on A & F, then rolls all that profit into G. Now, she has a 6-stock basket. Half of those have 35,000 shares, and the half only have 5,000. But even though her basket is lopsided, all she has to do is wait. And 2 years later, if Susie’s 6 stocks return to their all-time highs of $20, she turns $100k into $2.4 million. If she doesn’t bag hop and sticks with her 10 initial purchases of 5000 shares each, her portfolio grows only 10x from $100k to $1M. More money. Less risk. No margin. Any thoughts?

,"One of the most discouraging things I keep seeing on Reddit is investor after investor boasting about how margin, or playing with borrowed money, helped them grow the number of zeroes in their brokerage account. I agree, this is an intoxicating thought, but does the new investor realize that most of the Reddit accounts that are blown up overnight have the same thing in common? Yes, playing with margin can significantly increase your wealth, but there is also a 100% certainty that it will tear your arm off when stocks are plummeting. This is why trading inside retirement accounts is so beneficial to the everyday Joe. Not only are all his gains sheltered from taxes, which allows him to compound his gains over and over again without having to pay the government every time he sells, but most retirement accounts don’t allow trading on margin. When I was a new investor, I thought this little fun fact was a huge inconvenience. But what I learned is that not trading with borrowed money gives the investor a huge opportunity to “bag hop,” which is how I grew $97k to more than $2M in less than two years. Let me explain. My whole bag-hopping theory centers around the new investor who stays out of the market and hoards more and more cash until there’s a huge Black Swan event, which historically, occurs about every 6-8 years. You’ve only got to get rich once, so by staying out of the market and building cash reserves, the investor can maximize their “utility” by entering a bear market with the maximum amount of dry powder. A huge clearing event can be easily recognized by the VIX, “The Volatility Index/Fear Index,” spiking above 50. When Covid lockdowns halted the global economy, the VIX actually spiked above 60. And on this single event, with only $75,000, I went on a buying spree that eventually led me to structure my portfolio in way to that rapidly compounded my gains without using margin. The only caveat is this whole idea can only be safely executed with a huge margin of safety, which means, the investor must wait until there’s a major clearing event before entering the market. If the investor tried to do this in today’s economy, which is nearing the third year of a bull market, they would likely get crushed because today’s nosebleed valuations offer no protection to the downside and very little opportunity to stack bags. So here it is…. Let’s say Susie has $100k and sees the VIX spike above 50, picks up the Wall Street Journal, and finds 10 stocks that are trading 90% off their 52-week highs. For the sake of simplicity, we’ll say all of these 10 stocks are $20 stocks that are now on sale for $2. So, with 10 good ideas, and a huge margin of safety built into each undervalued stock, the Susie deploys her $100k evenly across a basket of table-pounding buys, which give her 5,000 shares of each company.

Price alone does not determine probability. C and J may have fallen to $1 because of poor fundamentals, e.g. bankruptcy risk. The probability of it recovering to $2 depends on the company’s ability to resolve its issues - not on the lower price itself.

The question is, what’s more likely: stocks E & H doubling again in the next three months, or stocks C & J returning to their $2 entry point? Clearly, it’s a lot easier for C&J to come back to $2 before E & H hit $12, so Susie the savvy investor banks the bags and rolls all that profit into C & J. Her basket is now full of 8 stocks instead of 10. Then, three months later, A & F are leading the portfolio with $300% gains while G is still stuck. Again, what is more likely, A & F get to $12, or G simply jumps from $2 to $4? Knowing the odds are far better for G to increase to $4, Susie banks the bags on A & F, then rolls all that profit into G. Now, she has a 6-stock basket. Half of those have 35,000 shares, and the half only have 5,000. But even though her basket is lopsided, all she has to do is wait. And 2 years later, if Susie’s 6 stocks return to their all-time highs of $20, she turns $100k into $2.4 million. If she doesn’t bag hop and sticks with her 10 initial purchases of 5000 shares each, her portfolio grows only 10x from $100k to $1M. More money. Less risk. No margin. Any thoughts? I’m curious if there’s any other folks who have tried this with their own portfolio….

,"One of the most discouraging things I keep seeing on Reddit is investor after investor boasting about how margin, or playing with borrowed money, helped them grow the number of zeroes in their brokerage account. I agree, this is an intoxicating thought, but does the new investor realize that most of the Reddit accounts that are blown up overnight have the same thing in common? Yes, playing with margin can significantly increase your wealth, but there is also a 100% certainty that it will tear your arm off when stocks are plummeting. This is why trading inside retirement accounts is so beneficial to the everyday Joe. Not only are all his gains sheltered from taxes, which allows him to compound his gains over and over again without having to pay the government every time he sells, but most retirement accounts don’t allow trading on margin. When I was a new investor, I thought this little fun fact was a huge inconvenience. But what I learned is that not trading with borrowed money gives the investor a huge opportunity to “bag hop,” which is how I grew $97k to more than $2M in less than two years. Let me explain. My whole bag-hopping theory centers around the new investor who stays out of the market and hoards more and more cash until there’s a huge Black Swan event, which historically, occurs about every 6-8 years. You’ve only got to get rich once, so by staying out of the market and building cash reserves, the investor can maximize their “utility” by entering a bear market with the maximum amount of dry powder. A huge clearing event can be easily recognized by the VIX, “The Volatility Index/Fear Index,” spiking above 50. When Covid lockdowns halted the global economy, the VIX actually spiked above 60. And on this single event, with only $75,000, I went on a buying spree that eventually led me to structure my portfolio in way to that rapidly compounded my gains without using margin. The only caveat is this whole idea can only be safely executed with a huge margin of safety, which means, the investor must wait until there’s a major clearing event before entering the market. If the investor tried to do this in today’s economy, which is nearing the third year of a bull market, they would likely get crushed because today’s nosebleed valuations offer no protection to the downside and very little opportunity to stack bags. So here it is…. Let’s say Susie has $100k and sees the VIX spike above 50, picks up the Wall Street Journal, and finds 10 stocks that are trading 90% off their 52-week highs. For the sake of simplicity, we’ll say all of these 10 stocks are $20 stocks that are now on sale for $2. So, with 10 good ideas, and a huge margin of safety built into each undervalued stock, the Susie deploys her $100k evenly across a basket of table-pounding buys, which give her 5,000 shares of each company. After three months, some stocks are stuck, some stocks are cheaper, and some stocks have bounced off their 52-week lows for 300% gains.

,"One of the most discouraging things I keep seeing on Reddit is investor after investor boasting about how margin, or playing with borrowed money, helped them grow the number of zeroes in their brokerage account. I agree, this is an intoxicating thought, but does the new investor realize that most of the Reddit accounts that are blown up overnight have the same thing in common? Yes, playing with margin can significantly increase your wealth, but there is also a 100% certainty that it will tear your arm off when stocks are plummeting. This is why trading inside retirement accounts is so beneficial to the everyday Joe. Not only are all his gains sheltered from taxes, which allows him to compound his gains over and over again without having to pay the government every time he sells, but most retirement accounts don’t allow trading on margin. When I was a new investor, I thought this little fun fact was a huge inconvenience. But what I learned is that not trading with borrowed money gives the investor a huge opportunity to “bag hop,” which is how I grew $97k to more than $2M in less than two years. Let me explain. My whole bag-hopping theory centers around the new investor who stays out of the market and hoards more and more cash until there’s a huge Black Swan event, which historically, occurs about every 6-8 years. You’ve only got to get rich once, so by staying out of the market and building cash reserves, the investor can maximize their “utility” by entering a bear market with the maximum amount of dry powder. A huge clearing event can be easily recognized by the VIX, “The Volatility Index/Fear Index,” spiking above 50. When Covid lockdowns halted the global economy, the VIX actually spiked above 60. And on this single event, with only $75,000, I went on a buying spree that eventually led me to structure my portfolio in way to that rapidly compounded my gains without using margin. The only caveat is this whole idea can only be safely executed with a huge margin of safety, which means, the investor must wait until there’s a major clearing event before entering the market. If the investor tried to do this in today’s economy, which is nearing the third year of a bull market, they would likely get crushed because today’s nosebleed valuations offer no protection to the downside and very little opportunity to stack bags. So here it is…. Let’s say Susie has $100k and sees the VIX spike above 50, picks up the Wall Street Journal, and finds 10 stocks that are trading 90% off their 52-week highs. For the sake of simplicity, we’ll say all of these 10 stocks are $20 stocks that are now on sale for $2. So, with 10 good ideas, and a huge margin of safety built into each undervalued stock, the Susie deploys her $100k evenly across a basket of table-pounding buys, which give her 5,000 shares of each company. After three months, some stocks are stuck, some stocks are cheaper, and some stocks have bounced off their 52-week lows for 300% gains. The question is, what’s more likely: stocks E & H doubling again in the next three months, or stocks C & J returning to their $2 entry point? Clearly, it’s a lot easier for C&J to come back to $2 before E & H hit $12, so Susie the savvy investor banks the bags and rolls all that profit into C & J. Her basket is now full of 8 stocks instead of 10. Then, three months later, A & F are leading the portfolio with $300% gains while G is still stuck. Again, what is more likely, A & F get to $12, or G simply jumps from $2 to $4? Knowing the odds are far better for G to increase to $4, Susie banks the bags on A & F, then rolls all that profit into G. Now, she has a 6-stock basket. Half of those have 35,000 shares, and the half only have 5,000. But even though her basket is lopsided, all she has to do is wait. And 2 years later, if Susie’s 6 stocks return to their all-time highs of $20, she turns $100k into $2.4 million. If she doesn’t bag hop and sticks with her 10 initial purchases of 5000 shares each, her portfolio grows only 10x from $100k to $1M. More money. Less risk. No margin. Any thoughts?
