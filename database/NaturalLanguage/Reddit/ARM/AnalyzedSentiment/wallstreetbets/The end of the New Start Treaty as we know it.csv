,"As we know, the New Start Treaty will end in 2026. For those who don't know what it is: the New Start Treaty is a treaty between the United States of America and the Russian Federation on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms. This treaty entered into force in 2011. This treaty brings limits to the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads and delivery systems each country can have. More specifically are the limits as follows: 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), deployed submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and deployed heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments; 1,550 nuclear warheads on deployed ICBMs, deployed SLBMs, and deployed heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments (each such heavy bomber is counted as one warhead toward this limit); 800 deployed and non-deployed ICBM launchers, SLBM launchers, and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments. As a consequence of this, the expectation is that countries like China, North Korea and Iran are also planning to build nuclear weapons at a faster pace. China is already doing this and the likelihood is that they will have a lot more weapons in 10 years. On top of that, with Trump claiming that he does not want to defend Taiwan (and maybe other Asian countries too - who knows -), maybe these other countries are also willing to build nuclear weapons. South Korea has the capability to build a few thousand more nuclear weapons than China because of their expertise. And Europe might have too. The effect might be limited when Trump does not become president, because Kamala Harris is less hawkish on expanding the arsenal, but I still believe that the ending will have a huge impact on the future arsenal of the US. Around 19% of electricity generation comes from nuclear energy. This is not little. With this in mind, the demand for uranium will increase, or plutonium. But plutonium is produced by the nuclear reaction from uranium. So it always starts with uranium. Also, using uranium for electricity generation, does not mean you can't use it for nuclear weapons afterwards. They can reprocess the spent fuel for nuclear weapons use. Therefore, wouldn't it be a good idea to invest in uranium or companies in the uranium industry? URA is an ETF that includes companies that are involved in various aspects of the uranium industry, including mining, refining, exploration, and production. It's currently trading at a price of 25.32 dollars. It dropped from 134 dollars in 2011, when the treaty took effect. In my opinion it could be a good idea to hold this for 10 years, starting from 2026.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,0.999,NEGATIVE

I was giving URA as an example, because URA dropped when the treaty came into effect, and started rising again right before the treaty was supposed to end. Of course, I don't only focus on the companies in US. I believe that the end of this treaty will increase the nuclear arsenal of countries significantly, since there won't be any limits any longer. And it's a kind of rat race. For every nuclear weapon a certain country builds, another one will do the same. Governments and their defense industry need to acquire uranium from the ones who have it.

,"As we know, the New Start Treaty will end in 2026. For those who don't know what it is: the New Start Treaty is a treaty between the United States of America and the Russian Federation on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms. This treaty entered into force in 2011. This treaty brings limits to the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads and delivery systems each country can have. More specifically are the limits as follows: 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), deployed submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and deployed heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments; 1,550 nuclear warheads on deployed ICBMs, deployed SLBMs, and deployed heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments (each such heavy bomber is counted as one warhead toward this limit); 800 deployed and non-deployed ICBM launchers, SLBM launchers, and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments. As a consequence of this, the expectation is that countries like China, North Korea and Iran are also planning to build nuclear weapons at a faster pace. China is already doing this and the likelihood is that they will have a lot more weapons in 10 years. On top of that, with Trump claiming that he does not want to defend Taiwan (and maybe other Asian countries too - who knows -), maybe these other countries are also willing to build nuclear weapons. South Korea has the capability to build a few thousand more nuclear weapons than China because of their expertise. And Europe might have too. The effect might be limited when Trump does not become president, because Kamala Harris is less hawkish on expanding the arsenal, but I still believe that the ending will have a huge impact on the future arsenal of the US. Around 19% of electricity generation comes from nuclear energy. This is not little. With this in mind, the demand for uranium will increase, or plutonium. But plutonium is produced by the nuclear reaction from uranium. So it always starts with uranium.

China is already doing this and the likelihood is that they will have a lot more weapons in 10 years. On top of that, with Trump claiming that he does not want to defend Taiwan (and maybe other Asian countries too - who knows -), maybe these other countries are also willing to build nuclear weapons. South Korea has the capability to build a few thousand more nuclear weapons than China because of their expertise. And Europe might have too. The effect might be limited when Trump does not become president, because Kamala Harris is less hawkish on expanding the arsenal, but I still believe that the ending will have a huge impact on the future arsenal of the US. Around 19% of electricity generation comes from nuclear energy. This is not little. With this in mind, the demand for uranium will increase, or plutonium. But plutonium is produced by the nuclear reaction from uranium. So it always starts with uranium. Also, using uranium for electricity generation, does not mean you can't use it for nuclear weapons afterwards. They can reprocess the spent fuel for nuclear weapons use. Therefore, wouldn't it be a good idea to invest in uranium or companies in the uranium industry? URA is an ETF that includes companies that are involved in various aspects of the uranium industry, including mining, refining, exploration, and production. It's currently trading at a price of 25.32 dollars. It dropped from 134 dollars in 2011, when the treaty took effect.

,"As we know, the New Start Treaty will end in 2026. For those who don't know what it is: the New Start Treaty is a treaty between the United States of America and the Russian Federation on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms. This treaty entered into force in 2011. This treaty brings limits to the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads and delivery systems each country can have. More specifically are the limits as follows: 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), deployed submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and deployed heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments; 1,550 nuclear warheads on deployed ICBMs, deployed SLBMs, and deployed heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments (each such heavy bomber is counted as one warhead toward this limit); 800 deployed and non-deployed ICBM launchers, SLBM launchers, and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments. As a consequence of this, the expectation is that countries like China, North Korea and Iran are also planning to build nuclear weapons at a faster pace.
