,"Hello fellow degenerates, Let’s talk about Teladoc (TDOC). If you’ve been following, you know it’s been through the fire and the flames. Once a darling of the telehealth boom, it’s now more like the kid who got benched after fucking up the big game. But I believe the tide is about to turn. Here’s my DD on why Teladoc might just be gearing up for a glorious comeback. 1. Current Stock Snapshot: The Lay of the Land Teladoc’s stock has seen better days, but as of now: Stock Price: $10.95 (down slightly today). 52-Week Range: From scraping the barrel at $9.50 to peaking around $30. Market Cap: Roughly $1.8 billion. This might look like a crash and burn to some, but I see opportunity at a discount. 2. Leadership Overhaul: A Fresh Start In June 2024, Teladoc made a bold move by appointing Chuck Divita as CEO. For context, Divita’s background includes: Leadership roles in companies like Humana, where he focused on growth and operational efficiency. A track record of successfully restructuring struggling business units. Divita’s focus on cost-cutting and streamlining operations has already started to show results in the company’s latest reporting and the best is yet to come. 3. Financial Performance: Clearing the Decks Let’s address the elephant in the room: Teladoc’s financials. Here’s what we know from Q2 2024: Goodwill Impairment: They took a $790 million write-down on BetterHelp, their mental health arm, which has a dogshit reputation, especially after their data privacy scandal. Believe it or not, people don’t want their deepest secrets and personal data sold to third parties. Whodathunkit? Net Loss: $838 million (yikes, but let’s look closer). Revenue: $650 million (up 5% YOY). Why This Isn’t All Bad News: The goodwill impairment is an accounting adjustment. It’s painful now, but it clears the books for future growth. BetterHelp’s revenue decline is a reflection of tightened marketing spend, which aligns with the new CEO’s cost-cutting strategy. TDOC has had a steady upward trend in revenue growth YOY. A good sign of internal management. 4. Market Position: Still a Leader Teladoc remains a dominant player in telehealth, with: 80+ million members. Partnerships with major insurers like UnitedHealthcare and CVS Health. A robust tech platform that integrates telehealth, mental health, and chronic condition management. Competitors: Teladoc’s main rivals are Amwell and MDLIVE, but neither has the same level of services, and also Amwell is dogshit. Teladoc’s ecosystem approach makes it stand out, especially as big employers and insurers need seamless integrated solutions. 5. Industry Outlook: Telehealth Is Here to Stay The pandemic normalized virtual care, but the trend isn’t going anywhere. Key stats: Market Growth: The global telehealth market is projected to reach $560 billion by 2030 (CAGR of 24%). Adoption Rates: 40% of patients now prefer telehealth for routine care. Regulatory Tailwinds: The U.S. government has extended telehealth reimbursement policies through 2025. Teladoc is uniquely positioned to capture this growth, thanks to its first-mover advantage and established brand. 6. Valuation: A Bargain Basement Buy? At its current price, Teladoc trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 1.5x. For comparison: Amwell: 2.3x P/S. Healthcare Sector Average: 4.0x P/S. This signals Teladoc is significantly undervalued relative to peers, especially given its revenue growth. 7. Catalysts: What Could Drive a Comeback? Profitability Goals: Teladoc aims to achieve positive EBITDA by mid-2025. Product Expansion: Launching AI-powered tools for personalized care. Potential Acquisition Target: At its current valuation, TDOC could attract interest from larger healthcare players. 8. Risks: No Rose-Colored Glasses Competition: Amazon is in this space. Relentless as fuck as always. Marketing Spend: Scaling back on ads could slow growth in the short term but is smart for a branding reboot. Macroeconomic Factors: Higher interest rates make growth companies less attractive to some investors. 9. Conclusion: Why I’m Bullish Teladoc is a classic turnaround story. Yes, it’s been beaten down, but the fundamentals—leadership changes, cost-cutting, and a growing market—suggest a brighter future. At its current valuation, the risk-reward ratio looks attractive. Do I want to be convinced otherwise? Fucking no so leave me alone bc I’m sensitive. TL;DR New leadership and strategic reset. Strong market position in a growing industry. Valuation suggests upside potential. Risks exist, but the reward looks worth it.

,"Hello fellow degenerates, Let’s talk about Teladoc (TDOC). If you’ve been following, you know it’s been through the fire and the flames. Once a darling of the telehealth boom, it’s now more like the kid who got benched after fucking up the big game. But I believe the tide is about to turn. Here’s my DD on why Teladoc might just be gearing up for a glorious comeback. 1. Current Stock Snapshot: The Lay of the Land Teladoc’s stock has seen better days, but as of now: Stock Price: $10.95 (down slightly today). 52-Week Range: From scraping the barrel at $9.50 to peaking around $30. Market Cap: Roughly $1.8 billion. This might look like a crash and burn to some, but I see opportunity at a discount. 2. Leadership Overhaul: A Fresh Start In June 2024, Teladoc made a bold move by appointing Chuck Divita as CEO. For context, Divita’s background includes: Leadership roles in companies like Humana, where he focused on growth and operational efficiency. A track record of successfully restructuring struggling business units. Divita’s focus on cost-cutting and streamlining operations has already started to show results in the company’s latest reporting and the best is yet to come. 3. Financial Performance: Clearing the Decks Let’s address the elephant in the room: Teladoc’s financials. Here’s what we know from Q2 2024: Goodwill Impairment: They took a $790 million write-down on BetterHelp, their mental health arm, which has a dogshit reputation, especially after their data privacy scandal. Believe it or not, people don’t want their deepest secrets and personal data sold to third parties. Whodathunkit? Net Loss: $838 million (yikes, but let’s look closer). Revenue: $650 million (up 5% YOY). Why This Isn’t All Bad News: The goodwill impairment is an accounting adjustment. It’s painful now, but it clears the books for future growth. BetterHelp’s revenue decline is a reflection of tightened marketing spend, which aligns with the new CEO’s cost-cutting strategy. TDOC has had a steady upward trend in revenue growth YOY. A good sign of internal management. 4. Market Position: Still a Leader Teladoc remains a dominant player in telehealth, with: 80+ million members. Partnerships with major insurers like UnitedHealthcare and CVS Health. A robust tech platform that integrates telehealth, mental health, and chronic condition management. Competitors: Teladoc’s main rivals are Amwell and MDLIVE, but neither has the same level of services, and also Amwell is dogshit. Teladoc’s ecosystem approach makes it stand out, especially as big employers and insurers need seamless integrated solutions. 5. Industry Outlook: Telehealth Is Here to Stay The pandemic normalized virtual care, but the trend isn’t going anywhere. Key stats: Market Growth: The global telehealth market is projected to reach $560 billion by 2030 (CAGR of 24%). Adoption Rates: 40% of patients now prefer telehealth for routine care. Regulatory Tailwinds: The U.S. government has extended telehealth reimbursement policies through 2025. Teladoc is uniquely positioned to capture this growth, thanks to its first-mover advantage and established brand. 6. Valuation: A Bargain Basement Buy?

Competitors: Teladoc’s main rivals are Amwell and MDLIVE, but neither has the same level of services, and also Amwell is dogshit.

Industry Outlook: Telehealth Is Here to Stay The pandemic normalized virtual care, but the trend isn’t going anywhere.

,"Hello fellow degenerates, Let’s talk about Teladoc (TDOC). If you’ve been following, you know it’s been through the fire and the flames. Once a darling of the telehealth boom, it’s now more like the kid who got benched after fucking up the big game. But I believe the tide is about to turn. Here’s my DD on why Teladoc might just be gearing up for a glorious comeback. 1. Current Stock Snapshot: The Lay of the Land Teladoc’s stock has seen better days, but as of now: Stock Price: $10.95 (down slightly today). 52-Week Range: From scraping the barrel at $9.50 to peaking around $30. Market Cap: Roughly $1.8 billion. This might look like a crash and burn to some, but I see opportunity at a discount. 2. Leadership Overhaul: A Fresh Start In June 2024, Teladoc made a bold move by appointing Chuck Divita as CEO. For context, Divita’s background includes: Leadership roles in companies like Humana, where he focused on growth and operational efficiency. A track record of successfully restructuring struggling business units. Divita’s focus on cost-cutting and streamlining operations has already started to show results in the company’s latest reporting and the best is yet to come. 3. Financial Performance: Clearing the Decks Let’s address the elephant in the room: Teladoc’s financials. Here’s what we know from Q2 2024: Goodwill Impairment: They took a $790 million write-down on BetterHelp, their mental health arm, which has a dogshit reputation, especially after their data privacy scandal. Believe it or not, people don’t want their deepest secrets and personal data sold to third parties. Whodathunkit? Net Loss: $838 million (yikes, but let’s look closer). Revenue: $650 million (up 5% YOY). Why This Isn’t All Bad News: The goodwill impairment is an accounting adjustment. It’s painful now, but it clears the books for future growth. BetterHelp’s revenue decline is a reflection of tightened marketing spend, which aligns with the new CEO’s cost-cutting strategy. TDOC has had a steady upward trend in revenue growth YOY.

Every doctor in the country has the ability to do telehealth through their EHR. Why go to a shitty teladoc visit when you can just get one with your PCP. They have a competitive disadvantage compared to a PCP because they have no referral networks to specialists.

Market Cap: Roughly $1.8 billion. This might look like a crash and burn to some, but I see opportunity at a discount. 2. Leadership Overhaul: A Fresh Start In June 2024, Teladoc made a bold move by appointing Chuck Divita as CEO. For context, Divita’s background includes: Leadership roles in companies like Humana, where he focused on growth and operational efficiency. A track record of successfully restructuring struggling business units. Divita’s focus on cost-cutting and streamlining operations has already started to show results in the company’s latest reporting and the best is yet to come. 3. Financial Performance: Clearing the Decks Let’s address the elephant in the room: Teladoc’s financials. Here’s what we know from Q2 2024: Goodwill Impairment: They took a $790 million write-down on BetterHelp, their mental health arm, which has a dogshit reputation, especially after their data privacy scandal. Believe it or not, people don’t want their deepest secrets and personal data sold to third parties. Whodathunkit? Net Loss: $838 million (yikes, but let’s look closer). Revenue: $650 million (up 5% YOY). Why This Isn’t All Bad News: The goodwill impairment is an accounting adjustment. It’s painful now, but it clears the books for future growth. BetterHelp’s revenue decline is a reflection of tightened marketing spend, which aligns with the new CEO’s cost-cutting strategy. TDOC has had a steady upward trend in revenue growth YOY. A good sign of internal management. 4. Market Position: Still a Leader Teladoc remains a dominant player in telehealth, with: 80+ million members. Partnerships with major insurers like UnitedHealthcare and CVS Health. A robust tech platform that integrates telehealth, mental health, and chronic condition management. Competitors: Teladoc’s main rivals are Amwell and MDLIVE, but neither has the same level of services, and also Amwell is dogshit. Teladoc’s ecosystem approach makes it stand out, especially as big employers and insurers need seamless integrated solutions. 5. Industry Outlook: Telehealth Is Here to Stay The pandemic normalized virtual care, but the trend isn’t going anywhere. Key stats: Market Growth: The global telehealth market is projected to reach $560 billion by 2030 (CAGR of 24%). Adoption Rates: 40% of patients now prefer telehealth for routine care. Regulatory Tailwinds: The U.S. government has extended telehealth reimbursement policies through 2025. Teladoc is uniquely positioned to capture this growth, thanks to its first-mover advantage and established brand. 6. Valuation: A Bargain Basement Buy? At its current price, Teladoc trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 1.5x. For comparison: Amwell: 2.3x P/S. Healthcare Sector Average: 4.0x P/S. This signals Teladoc is significantly undervalued relative to peers, especially given its revenue growth. 7. Catalysts: What Could Drive a Comeback? Profitability Goals: Teladoc aims to achieve positive EBITDA by mid-2025. Product Expansion: Launching AI-powered tools for personalized care. Potential Acquisition Target: At its current valuation, TDOC could attract interest from larger healthcare players. 8. Risks: No Rose-Colored Glasses Competition: Amazon is in this space. Relentless as fuck as always. Marketing Spend: Scaling back on ads could slow growth in the short term but is smart for a branding reboot. Macroeconomic Factors: Higher interest rates make growth companies less attractive to some investors. 9. Conclusion: Why I’m Bullish Teladoc is a classic turnaround story. Yes, it’s been beaten down, but the fundamentals—leadership changes, cost-cutting, and a growing market—suggest a brighter future. At its current valuation, the risk-reward ratio looks attractive. Do I want to be convinced otherwise? Fucking no so leave me alone bc I’m sensitive. TL;DR New leadership and strategic reset. Strong market position in a growing industry. Valuation suggests upside potential. Risks exist, but the reward looks worth it.
