,"The US arm of Italian defense co. Leonardo have had an incredible '24. Since their acquisition of $RADA a while back the price has surged near $30 from its single digit point. ER approaching on July 30th, with Y/Y rev up 20% on their last report. Mgmt is actively seeking more M/A, and they've weathered this recent bear week with incredible resilience. While their valuation is a bit high for the sector, they have an $8 bil backlog on orders. Nobody seems to be following this company, and I'm curious if there are any other holders here who feel as confident as I do. Currently holding 30 $30 calls for Jan '25. Not much OI on other contracts at the moment. Let's discuss!",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,0.999,NEGATIVE
