,"A few days ago, I was considering buying some Arm shares due to its promising revenue, and sell off in the mid of April. However, today, it surged 7% in response to the news where it will introduce a new Ai chip in 2025. The hype is real, and now the price is still surging at this moment. I personally think the company hasn’t really proved it self like and just started trading not even a year ago. Also the price now is over the analyst’s consensus price. Do you think there will be a sell-off soon? Or the expectation for it is realistic?","NVidia was going to pay 40 billion for it 2 years ago so thats probably the bottom of the line valuation. Even though the company doesn't really make a ton money, being able to control arm licensing would be a big deal, is that worth 112 billion dollars though. Probably not.",0,0.556,NEGATIVE,1.0

Might be worth it… might also be the same reason NVDA was going to got blocked by the DOJ though,1,0.528,NEGATIVE,0.999

That is absurd. All this is based on this idea that ARM can be the chip of the future and such. That just isn't happening. ARM already holds around half of all chips in the world sold under its architecture, yet somehow it still has really low earnings and sales. This is because licensing and royalties are just not super profitable. There's a reason x86 isn't exactly making Intel billions.It'll probably stay high for a long time, because that's just how bubbles work, but eventually it has to crash; otherwise, it'll have to grow an INSANE amount over the coming years to justify that price",0,0.54,NEGATIVE,1.0

It also helped that the SPAC/IPO bubble bursted in 2021.As for NVDA, most of its sales come from the megacap companies. It's growing by overcharging the megacap companies. At 2.3 trillions, it's almost as big as Microsoft and Apple. It can't really get much bigger than those megacap, if they are the ones boosting NVDA sales. Either those megacap stocks drop, or NVDA sales will slow. That should be the catalyst for the NVDA correction, and the stop to the AI exuberance.",3,0.551,POSITIVE,0.787

The potential market will be ever increasing since these chips will be used in cars, healthcare, cyber security, architecture, material science.I don't see mega caps as their only consumer since they're already supplying labs with their chips for protein synthesis and stuff like that.As for the bubble, in 2000 the multiples were insane and not backed up by earnings.

At the peak of CSCO, sales was still growing 40%. Megacap are the main customer for Nvidia now probably comprising 50% of their sales, 20% or so from China. If it keeps growing at this rate, who's the next companies that will contribute to the next 60-100 billions in sales? That must mean they are multiples of that in sales, otherwise they cannot continue doing it forever.

You can look it up. Whereas nvidia has increased compute capacity by a million times in the last decade. And they have a 10 year lead since they made kuda so long ago. Once you know the tech and the industry, there's no similarity between Cisco and nvidia. And yes if the growth of nvidia stagnates, then there will be a correction but no bubble will burst because there is none. The pe multiples are heightened across the board due the low interest rates for so long.And ""bio stuff"" and domains like that will be peanuts until it isn't. 50 years ago we couldn't make smart phones because of another problem: material sciences weren't developed enough. Now we need folding phones, agile spacesuits, better vaccines. What nvidia has made will enable us to make simulations more accurate and innovate in numerous important domains. From structural integrity of buildings in earthquake zones, to finding cures of diseases(cure is really profitable). Therefore when they make a new chip or architecture, people will want it as long as it's faster since it overall increases the rate of innovation. The main thing to keep heed of is that they need to churn out better chips than anyone for quite a while for justifying their valuation, and as of now they're doing that.Also the pe multiples were in the 500s for most companies in the year 2000.

,"A few days ago, I was considering buying some Arm shares due to its promising revenue, and sell off in the mid of April. However, today, it surged 7% in response to the news where it will introduce a new Ai chip in 2025. The hype is real, and now the price is still surging at this moment. I personally think the company hasn’t really proved it self like and just started trading not even a year ago. Also the price now is over the analyst’s consensus price. Do you think there will be a sell-off soon? Or the expectation for it is realistic?",lol,1,0.5,POSITIVE,0.737

Prolly not. But, with the current landscape, it’s hard to really gauge what is speculation and what is facts.",0,0.525,NEGATIVE,1.0

Now it’s been at $900 for over a monthARM isn’t a public company. The stock that you can buy is part of the company that owns the shares of ARM (because it’s not available to the public). You decide if you want in on it or not. For me, hell yes I’ll be buying as much as I can. AI isn’t going away anytime soon, and soon Quantum Computing will be the next rage. Do you want part of a top of the line CPU production company during all that?",0,0.592,NEGATIVE,0.931

Hell it’s basically got Tesla, Amazon, Meta, and major players sinking their teeth into the 30k GPUs like they are candy. Plus that company is run very well culturally and sustains the desire for people to want to innovate and stick around.This is unlike Amazon that sheds talented people due to the toxic culture that is very real and very well known…don’t ask how I know :)I would say that Arm will follow Nvidia whichever direction they end up going. The other ones tied in are TSM and ASML.I am pretty confident that NVidia likely has one more major run left in it before it “matures” from a behavioral standpoint.",0,0.528,POSITIVE,0.827
