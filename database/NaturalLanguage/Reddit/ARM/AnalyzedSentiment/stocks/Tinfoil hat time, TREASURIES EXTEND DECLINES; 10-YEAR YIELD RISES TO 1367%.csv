Too much tinfoil hat? What happens when 10yr hits 2%? 2.5? 3?","Why are people obsessed with locking in a ""3%"" (low rate) mortgage. Isn't it better to wait until interest rates are high since that will mean your average buyer will have less money to spend on a home and thus the home prices will be lower? Compare that to times when interest rate are low. Everyone can go to the bank and get a huge loan and then use that purchasing power to inflate housing prices.You can also refinance your high-interest loan if needed. You can't ""renegotiate"" the purchase price of your home after you've bought it. The purchase price is locked in.",1,0.517,0.999,NEGATIVE

What happens when 10yr hits 2%? 2.5? 3?","No, because house price increase in 30 years time will outstrip any possible discount you might get for interest rates being higher or even a 2008 style recession in true prime markets. For instance houses in LA prime market that could be bought for $400-$800k pre 2008 barely dropped by 2009 and by 2011 we’re already blowing past those prices. Those houses now are $1.2m-$2m. That’s in 10 years. So locking in incredibly cheap debt and freeing up your capital means that in 20 years your house will be worth double and you’re paying fuck all in interest, while you’re investments bring in nice returns for those 20 years. Sure certain areas got hit really bad but prime real estate being bought by rich people didn’t. Another example: the prime areas of London and Paris only saw a 7% average dip in the last recession.",2,0.526,1.0,NEGATIVE

Too much tinfoil hat? What happens when 10yr hits 2%? 2.5? 3?",If you’re a cash buyer it’s a good strategy. Locking in a low interest rate fixed means you have a put option (refinancing) if interest rates drop further. If interest rates rise your loan becomes more valuable to you and less valuable to the lender. They would rather have you refinance or pay off early if rates rise. In a variable rate loan you assume the risk of higher payments if rates rise and benefit from lower payments if rates drop. Just my opinion is that rates have a higher chance of going up instead of down. That’s why I locked in a low 30 year fixed rate.,2,0.524,0.619,NEGATIVE
