Very cheap and can transfer Turkish Liras very cheap to the brokerage before converting them to USD or Euros to invest. My friends here use Midas (the Turkish one) and are very happy.

Can’t believe people keep falling for this.They are Russian scammers who shut down in Dec then restarted and blamed everyone but themselves. Their funds are stored in Switzerland to avoid scrutiny and taxes.Midas founder and CEO Iakov Levin and the core group are playing the long game offering depositors high yields and no insurance for deposit security.When in doubt read reviews and Google insiders names and add ‘fraud’ or ‘scam’.. you’d be surprised what info gets buried in Goog search results because in a broad based search bad news is filtered down because they pay services to hide this info. Always scrutinize and be very careful.https://www.trustpilot.com/review/midas.investments,2,0.521,1.0,NEGATIVE
