Morally questionable VC investing will lead to regulation: Coinbase is doing some really slimy things with the tokens they list, and it will ultimately be their downfall.

I'm not saying that you're wrong, but I really don't think Coinbase has listed a lot of cryptocurrencies that are obscure. Plenty of worthless ones, to be sure, but most are well known names in the crypto community.I would also recommend that you learn the difference between a 'coin' and a 'token'. It's an important distinction, and calling everything a 'token' detracts from your larger point, which I believe has some merit as it pertains to $COIN.",0,0.518,1.0,NEGATIVE

Competitors have to not only overcome the established Coinbase, but also any new innovations or changes in their business practices - including lowering of fees. I see it less as a buy-forever company, and more as a buy-for-a-decade-plus. And I say that knowing I could be wrong.Coinbase is set up from the get-go to be the regulated option within the United States. Can Crypto stay unregulated forever ? If so, Coinbase will have problems. My bet is more regulation of some unknown type is coming to crypto and Coinbase is well positioned to come out of that with additional competitive advantages.This is a variant of the 2nd point. Even if you're right, Coinbase probably can adapt, and I'm unsure why this would only apply to Coinbase or not be applicable to the many others in this space.I continue to view cryptos primarily as if they are a currency. Do you envision some future where ETF's are spent like currency at businesses ? I don't.These are great thought-provoking points, thanks for posting.",0,0.535,0.98,NEGATIVE

Being the biggest name and having first mover advantage is huge. My criticism is their customer service which they have recently stated they will address with 24/7 phones/chat.Do you have any proof of what you are saying on this. The way you denote it, is securities fraud. They have VC investing but I highly doubt it’s them buying coins and then offloading to customers in a quid pro quo situation.I don’t think they will be doing any real regulating anytime soon. They are completely clueless on how to do it. Also Coinbase has been way more forthcoming with regards to regulations than the other exchanges. Whether that will be an advantage or disadvantage we will find out.Most people are buying crypto on Coinbase to move coins and use wallets etc (most not all). These are not the same people who would decide to buy a shiba inu ETF….god bless whoever that person might be.I look at buying Coinbase stock as buying the casino instead of playing the slots.
