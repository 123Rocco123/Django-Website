,"The European Union on Tuesday accused Microsoft of breaching antitrust rules with the “abusive” bundling of its Teams and Office products. “The European Commission has informed Microsoft of its preliminary view that Microsoft has breached EU antitrust rules by tying its communication and collaboration product Teams to its popular productivity applications included in its suites for businesses Office 365 and Microsoft 365,” the European Commission — the EU’s executive arm — said in a Statement of Objections, which is sent to inform companies of concerns raised against them. If the Commission decides that an infringement has taken place once companies have responded, it can ban the conduct and fine the charged company up to 10% of its global revenue. Microsoft took the pre-emptive step to unbundle Teams from Microsoft 365 in an effort to quash antitrust concerns by the EU. However, the Commission said in its Tuesday statement that the changes were “insufficient to address its concerns and that more changes to Microsoft’s conduct are necessary to restore competition.” Microsoft said it would work to find solutions to address the additional Commission’s concerns. “Having unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today,” Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith said in a statement Tuesday. The company’s shares were broadly unchanged in pre-market trading Tuesday. The EU opened its investigation into Microsoft — which remains ongoing — in July 2023 following a complaint by Salesforce-owned Slack, which has a rival chat service to Teams. The Commission’s concerns are centered around the fact that, starting in around 2019, Microsoft tied Teams with its software-as-a-service — or SaaS — applications, such as Office. It notes that Microsoft is “dominant worldwide” in the SaaS market for professional productivity applications. “In particular, the Commission is concerned that Microsoft may have granted Teams a distribution advantage by not giving customers the choice whether or not to acquire access to Teams when they subscribe to their SaaS productivity applications,” EU regulators wrote, noting that the tech giant’s advantage may have been exacerbated by limitations of interoperability — the ability of two or more systems to work together — between Microsoft’s offerings and Teams’ competitors. “The conduct may have prevented Teams’ rivals from competing, and in turn innovating, to the detriment of customers in the European Economic Area,” the Commission said.

The company’s shares were broadly unchanged in pre-market trading Tuesday. The EU opened its investigation into Microsoft — which remains ongoing — in July 2023 following a complaint by Salesforce-owned Slack, which has a rival chat service to Teams. The Commission’s concerns are centered around the fact that, starting in around 2019, Microsoft tied Teams with its software-as-a-service — or SaaS — applications, such as Office. It notes that Microsoft is “dominant worldwide” in the SaaS market for professional productivity applications. “In particular, the Commission is concerned that Microsoft may have granted Teams a distribution advantage by not giving customers the choice whether or not to acquire access to Teams when they subscribe to their SaaS productivity applications,” EU regulators wrote, noting that the tech giant’s advantage may have been exacerbated by limitations of interoperability — the ability of two or more systems to work together — between Microsoft’s offerings and Teams’ competitors. “The conduct may have prevented Teams’ rivals from competing, and in turn innovating, to the detriment of customers in the European Economic Area,” the Commission said.

In order to truly give customers the ability to decide, you have to give all options a fair chance. When a large company bundles a new product for free, even if it is inferior, the decision is made for the customer by the large company.Have you used all 3 products? Would you choose Teams if all 3 were paid the same, and if you had to download all 3 and install?I use Teams in both the current company and the previous company. Not because it is the best, it is actually the worst product on the market, but it is for free. The issue with this is that this free product is given by the largest company in the world and has high dominance over the area where it was even able to give this for free. Other companies are not able to even give their products for free like Microsoft did.Now think what would happen 10 years from now. The other companies with better products would die. Once that happens, actually Microsoft can jack up the price, even though their product was the inferior one, to a price that is more expensive than what the competitor was charging.It is very dangerous when a large company gives something for free, because they can give something for free, and killing potentially innovation in the space. They are diverting profits from other parts of the business (since they are large) to this particular new space and killing the innovation and choices in it.Remember that Microsoft Teams does not only represent messaging, but also potentially will dominate voip telephone. It will start charging higher once all the competitors have died.",4,0.572,NEGATIVE,1.0

Let's say you work, and your work has a cafeteria, they sell cookies there. The nearest place you can buy a cookie is 10 minutes drive. Now you are on your break and you want to buy a cookie, so you have to make a decision. Now, you can drive 10 minutes for a better cookie, or buy the cookie from the cafeteria. The cookie in the cafeteria is basically a 5/10 in quality, the one 10 minutes away is 10/10. Out of 100 employees that wants a cookie or a SNACK even, will most likely buy the one at the cafeteria. The choice of what cookie the employees buy, is not really up to the employee, it is made by the Food Manager of the Cafeteria. At any whim one day he can put Oreos and the next day a different cookie that he likes, the choices are up to him, and less up to each individual employee. Now imagine that this Food Manager not only have power over this cafeteria but all cafeterias in the world. In fact all 90% of office buildings in the world comes equipped with this cafeteria chain, and so this food manager dictates what 1 cookie is sold in this cafeteria. Now, your wife, wants to get into the cookie business, she makes a cookie that is 10/10. Can she compete with this Food Manager? She can probably compete at the supermarket as she can do cold calls to all the super market and try to get her cookies carried there. But how about if all supermarkets basically only carry 1 cookie and this food manager also controls that? lol Now she has only access to small shops.

Microsoft took the pre-emptive step to unbundle Teams from Microsoft 365 in an effort to quash antitrust concerns by the EU. However, the Commission said in its Tuesday statement that the changes were “insufficient to address its concerns and that more changes to Microsoft’s conduct are necessary to restore competition.” Microsoft said it would work to find solutions to address the additional Commission’s concerns. “Having unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today,” Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith said in a statement Tuesday. The company’s shares were broadly unchanged in pre-market trading Tuesday. The EU opened its investigation into Microsoft — which remains ongoing — in July 2023 following a complaint by Salesforce-owned Slack, which has a rival chat service to Teams. The Commission’s concerns are centered around the fact that, starting in around 2019, Microsoft tied Teams with its software-as-a-service — or SaaS — applications, such as Office. It notes that Microsoft is “dominant worldwide” in the SaaS market for professional productivity applications. “In particular, the Commission is concerned that Microsoft may have granted Teams a distribution advantage by not giving customers the choice whether or not to acquire access to Teams when they subscribe to their SaaS productivity applications,” EU regulators wrote, noting that the tech giant’s advantage may have been exacerbated by limitations of interoperability — the ability of two or more systems to work together — between Microsoft’s offerings and Teams’ competitors. “The conduct may have prevented Teams’ rivals from competing, and in turn innovating, to the detriment of customers in the European Economic Area,” the Commission said.

It notes that Microsoft is “dominant worldwide” in the SaaS market for professional productivity applications. “In particular, the Commission is concerned that Microsoft may have granted Teams a distribution advantage by not giving customers the choice whether or not to acquire access to Teams when they subscribe to their SaaS productivity applications,” EU regulators wrote, noting that the tech giant’s advantage may have been exacerbated by limitations of interoperability — the ability of two or more systems to work together — between Microsoft’s offerings and Teams’ competitors. “The conduct may have prevented Teams’ rivals from competing, and in turn innovating, to the detriment of customers in the European Economic Area,” the Commission said.

However, the Commission said in its Tuesday statement that the changes were “insufficient to address its concerns and that more changes to Microsoft’s conduct are necessary to restore competition.” Microsoft said it would work to find solutions to address the additional Commission’s concerns. “Having unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today,” Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith said in a statement Tuesday. The company’s shares were broadly unchanged in pre-market trading Tuesday. The EU opened its investigation into Microsoft — which remains ongoing — in July 2023 following a complaint by Salesforce-owned Slack, which has a rival chat service to Teams. The Commission’s concerns are centered around the fact that, starting in around 2019, Microsoft tied Teams with its software-as-a-service — or SaaS — applications, such as Office. It notes that Microsoft is “dominant worldwide” in the SaaS market for professional productivity applications. “In particular, the Commission is concerned that Microsoft may have granted Teams a distribution advantage by not giving customers the choice whether or not to acquire access to Teams when they subscribe to their SaaS productivity applications,” EU regulators wrote, noting that the tech giant’s advantage may have been exacerbated by limitations of interoperability — the ability of two or more systems to work together — between Microsoft’s offerings and Teams’ competitors. “The conduct may have prevented Teams’ rivals from competing, and in turn innovating, to the detriment of customers in the European Economic Area,” the Commission said.

,"The European Union on Tuesday accused Microsoft of breaching antitrust rules with the “abusive” bundling of its Teams and Office products. “The European Commission has informed Microsoft of its preliminary view that Microsoft has breached EU antitrust rules by tying its communication and collaboration product Teams to its popular productivity applications included in its suites for businesses Office 365 and Microsoft 365,” the European Commission — the EU’s executive arm — said in a Statement of Objections, which is sent to inform companies of concerns raised against them. If the Commission decides that an infringement has taken place once companies have responded, it can ban the conduct and fine the charged company up to 10% of its global revenue. Microsoft took the pre-emptive step to unbundle Teams from Microsoft 365 in an effort to quash antitrust concerns by the EU. However, the Commission said in its Tuesday statement that the changes were “insufficient to address its concerns and that more changes to Microsoft’s conduct are necessary to restore competition.” Microsoft said it would work to find solutions to address the additional Commission’s concerns. “Having unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today,” Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith said in a statement Tuesday. The company’s shares were broadly unchanged in pre-market trading Tuesday. The EU opened its investigation into Microsoft — which remains ongoing — in July 2023 following a complaint by Salesforce-owned Slack, which has a rival chat service to Teams.
