,"Sony Group is considering spinning off its insurance and online banking unit, responding to longstanding calls from some investors to focus on its core entertainment businesses. The partial spinoff would include a listing of the financial business, which was worth more than $8 billion when Sony delisted it in 2020. Sony stock rose 6.4% Thursday as investors welcomed the plan, as well as a share buyback of about $1.45 billion that was announced Wednesday. Sony has flipped back and forth over the years about how to handle its financial arm, which serves mostly Japanese consumers with products such as life insurance and online bank accounts. The business, while bringing in steady profit, has only limited connections to other Sony businesses such as its PlayStation videogame machines and image sensors used in Apple phones. “We will need bigger investment in image sensors and entertainment in the future,” said Hiroki Totoki, a longtime Sony executive who became the company’s president this year. Sony initially listed Sony Financial Holdings in 2007, while retaining a majority stake. Then in 2020, it bought back the publicly held shares and made it a fully owned subsidiary again. Under the latest plan, Sony would retain a stake of less than 20% in the business, but the financial products unit would continue to use the Sony brand. Sony said the spinoff and public offering could happen in two to three years. Third Point, an activist hedge fund run by investor Daniel Loeb, said in 2019 that Sony’s portfolio needed to be simplified, and that Sony should consider selling its stakes in publicly traded companies including the financial unit, which was listed then.

,"Sony Group is considering spinning off its insurance and online banking unit, responding to longstanding calls from some investors to focus on its core entertainment businesses. The partial spinoff would include a listing of the financial business, which was worth more than $8 billion when Sony delisted it in 2020. Sony stock rose 6.4% Thursday as investors welcomed the plan, as well as a share buyback of about $1.45 billion that was announced Wednesday. Sony has flipped back and forth over the years about how to handle its financial arm, which serves mostly Japanese consumers with products such as life insurance and online bank accounts. The business, while bringing in steady profit, has only limited connections to other Sony businesses such as its PlayStation videogame machines and image sensors used in Apple phones. “We will need bigger investment in image sensors and entertainment in the future,” said Hiroki Totoki, a longtime Sony executive who became the company’s president this year. Sony initially listed Sony Financial Holdings in 2007, while retaining a majority stake. Then in 2020, it bought back the publicly held shares and made it a fully owned subsidiary again. Under the latest plan, Sony would retain a stake of less than 20% in the business, but the financial products unit would continue to use the Sony brand. Sony said the spinoff and public offering could happen in two to three years. Third Point, an activist hedge fund run by investor Daniel Loeb, said in 2019 that Sony’s portfolio needed to be simplified, and that Sony should consider selling its stakes in publicly traded companies including the financial unit, which was listed then. Sony Group has forecast the financial unit’s operating income will drop 20% to the equivalent of about $1.3 billion in the fiscal year ending March 2024, after some one-time gains last fiscal year.",No way they're giving up the movie rights to Spiderman.
