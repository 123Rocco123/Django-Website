,"About me: I like to write about semiconductor companies and tech stocks. My previous analysis (examples: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ) have been upvoted to the top of r/stocks or near the top. However, today, I want to ask the community about fake meat companies. I converted to a plant-based diet during the pandemic after watching the Netflix documentary ""The Game Changers"". After I went plant-based, I noticed the following benefits: No more acid reflux. Red meat, dairy, eggs, and cheese often caused painful acid reflux. Much harder erections and better sex life More stamina Generally more energy and feeling less lethargic Other benefits include: Over the long term, science studies from reputable universities and institutions have shown that a plant-based diet reduces the likelihood of many diseases such as cancer and heart disease. Not eating animals Helping the environment (meat and dairy account for more emissions than cars and vans combined). Lastly, I believe fake meat will one day cost less than real meat because it simply takes more resources to house, feed, transport, and butcher a cow than harvesting plants. Given all these benefits, I believe that fake meat companies will grow and will hit a point in the near future where people will adopt more of a plant-based diet. Basically, I believe meat-eaters will be the weirdos in the future, not plant-based. Will governments start boosting fake meat companies? Meat industry produces more emissions than cars and vans. But governments have only focused on electric cars Could governments start taxing meat producers, which would favor fake meat producers? Could governments give tax breaks and grants to fake meat producers? The electric car market is huge today. Every electric car company that goes onto the market has a market cap of tens of billions. Could something similar happen to fake meat/fake-animal food market? I invested in Beyond Meat. But due to the growth bubble popping, my stop-price setting sold everything early and saved me from losing more money. Right now I don't own any fake meat companies. However, I believe that we're still in the early stages of this industry so I believe the total addressable market will drastically increase, just like the electric car market once did. But are there any companies out there that are like the Tesla of the fake meat industry? Basically this: Doing the really hard work now such as creating giant factories for cheap mass production or starting farms to grow plants Has defensible tech that other competitors can't easily replicate Management that is in it for the long-haul, not just to ride the hype and make a couple of dollars I’m not a trader. I like to hold stocks for 5-10 years. What company could I hold for 5-10 years?",Tell me more about this harder erections.,0,0.498,0.995,POSITIVE

Litteraly the same meat as the real stuff, but grown in lab rather than on farm. no pollution. maybe even cheaper production costs. lower prices than real meat.We have a winner.",0,0.51,0.989,NEGATIVE

It's only in the last decade that there has been a big push to develop and utilize technology to create plant-based meat that is designed for meat-eaters. It's apparent by the fact that these products are now sold in meat departments, where before that you would not find veggie burgers anywhere near the meat departments.It's the difference between this, and this.Hell, we are at the point in time now where the largest meat producers in the world are starting to use new advancements in technology to roll out their own plant-based meat products to be marketed next to their slaughter-based products. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-08-15/tyson-s-quest-to-be-your-one-stop-protein-shop",3,0.542,0.532,POSITIVE

,"About me: I like to write about semiconductor companies and tech stocks. My previous analysis (examples: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ) have been upvoted to the top of r/stocks or near the top. However, today, I want to ask the community about fake meat companies. I converted to a plant-based diet during the pandemic after watching the Netflix documentary ""The Game Changers"". After I went plant-based, I noticed the following benefits: No more acid reflux. Red meat, dairy, eggs, and cheese often caused painful acid reflux. Much harder erections and better sex life More stamina Generally more energy and feeling less lethargic Other benefits include: Over the long term, science studies from reputable universities and institutions have shown that a plant-based diet reduces the likelihood of many diseases such as cancer and heart disease. Not eating animals Helping the environment (meat and dairy account for more emissions than cars and vans combined). Lastly, I believe fake meat will one day cost less than real meat because it simply takes more resources to house, feed, transport, and butcher a cow than harvesting plants. Given all these benefits, I believe that fake meat companies will grow and will hit a point in the near future where people will adopt more of a plant-based diet. Basically, I believe meat-eaters will be the weirdos in the future, not plant-based. Will governments start boosting fake meat companies? Meat industry produces more emissions than cars and vans. But governments have only focused on electric cars Could governments start taxing meat producers, which would favor fake meat producers? Could governments give tax breaks and grants to fake meat producers? The electric car market is huge today. Every electric car company that goes onto the market has a market cap of tens of billions. Could something similar happen to fake meat/fake-animal food market? I invested in Beyond Meat. But due to the growth bubble popping, my stop-price setting sold everything early and saved me from losing more money. Right now I don't own any fake meat companies. However, I believe that we're still in the early stages of this industry so I believe the total addressable market will drastically increase, just like the electric car market once did. But are there any companies out there that are like the Tesla of the fake meat industry? Basically this: Doing the really hard work now such as creating giant factories for cheap mass production or starting farms to grow plants Has defensible tech that other competitors can't easily replicate Management that is in it for the long-haul, not just to ride the hype and make a couple of dollars I’m not a trader.

What company could I hold for 5-10 years?","Originally I thought it was going to be Beyond meat - but somehow they dropped the ball on going global (and have since been eclipsed in terms of product variety, quantity and quality by others). Impossible foods seem promising, but also not the meteoric 'Tesla-like' rise one would have expected (and you can only invest privately AFAIK)",0,0.527,0.993,NEGATIVE
