,"Introduction: The gaming industry has been gaining notoriety in the news lately, with the MSFT-ATVI acquisition and the hype around NVDA boosting the stock prices for the gaming industry as well. EA, in particular, investors have been overly bullish on them. I believe that the current EA model of acquiring studios to acquire their IPs is ill-fitted for the gaming industry considering the success stories of other game developers e.g. Riot, Valve, etc all relied on having a champion cash cow. EA's problems go beyond just their business model, their largest cash cow the FIFA series has recently ended its partnership with the FIFA organization and spun off into EA Sports FC, the success of EA Sports FC is uncertain now that the main body overseeing football no longer backs the FIFA series. REVENUE: There has been a paradigm shift in how EA will approach its business model, EA wants to make players more interconnected. “having more friends and building stronger friendships in our network leads to more time spent playing and connecting. As a cornerstone of our priorities of growth, we will continue to implement these tools across our portfolio” - 2023 Q4 Earnings conference. So, going forward their focus will be on making their large titles feel more interconnected rather than buying new and smaller titles. EA has split revenue into 3 tranches, “Full Game Download”, “Packaged Goods”, and “Live Services and Others” “Full Game Download” refers to virtual downloads of the game released by EA. “Packaged Goods” refers to hard copies of the game that EA sells to a third party. “Live Services and Others” refers to DLC. FULL GAME DOWNLOAD When forecasting Games Released, I'm uncertain to what extent EA will execute their new paradigm shift so to avoid making incorrect assumptions I assumed that the number of titles EA released would be in line with historic averages. When forecasting Revenue/Game, given that management’s guidance was to focus on older and bigger IPs to create a community. I assume that sales of new games grew at historical averages before tapering down to grow in line with inflation. PACKAGED GOODS AND LIVE SERVICES When forecasting Live Services and Others, I opted to use a nominal Y/Y to reflect the uncertainty in this arm of revenue. As Live Services and Others are only driven by a few popular and older titles e.g. Apex Legends, FIFA, etc. I assume that Live Services grows in line with historic averages as EA figures out how best to grow their community before there is a slight ramp-up in growth and then tapering down to grow in line with inflation until perpetuity. COST: R&D AND COST OF GOODS SOLD When forecasting R&D and COGS, opting for less granularity I followed historic trends and took the historical averages. MARKETING When forecasting Marketing, “Operating expenses were up 5%, excluding our fourth quarter restructuring charge. Our people costs increased as we continue to invest behind our portfolio, and we also saw higher marketing spend to support new releases.” - 2023 Q4 Earnings conference. I assume that Marketing will increase to an elevated level to support more marketing for older flagship IPs and remain elevated till perpetuity. G&A When forecasting G&A, given that EA has stated their desire to build out communities rather than developing more and more different kinds of games, I assume that G&A remains constant till perpetuity. OTHERS When forecasting Others, I opted to follow historic trends and assumed that it would continue till perpetuity.

REVENUE: There has been a paradigm shift in how EA will approach its business model, EA wants to make players more interconnected. “having more friends and building stronger friendships in our network leads to more time spent playing and connecting. As a cornerstone of our priorities of growth, we will continue to implement these tools across our portfolio” - 2023 Q4 Earnings conference. So, going forward their focus will be on making their large titles feel more interconnected rather than buying new and smaller titles. EA has split revenue into 3 tranches, “Full Game Download”, “Packaged Goods”, and “Live Services and Others” “Full Game Download” refers to virtual downloads of the game released by EA. “Packaged Goods” refers to hard copies of the game that EA sells to a third party. “Live Services and Others” refers to DLC. FULL GAME DOWNLOAD When forecasting Games Released, I'm uncertain to what extent EA will execute their new paradigm shift so to avoid making incorrect assumptions I assumed that the number of titles EA released would be in line with historic averages. When forecasting Revenue/Game, given that management’s guidance was to focus on older and bigger IPs to create a community. I assume that sales of new games grew at historical averages before tapering down to grow in line with inflation. PACKAGED GOODS AND LIVE SERVICES When forecasting Live Services and Others, I opted to use a nominal Y/Y to reflect the uncertainty in this arm of revenue. As Live Services and Others are only driven by a few popular and older titles e.g. Apex Legends, FIFA, etc. I assume that Live Services grows in line with historic averages as EA figures out how best to grow their community before there is a slight ramp-up in growth and then tapering down to grow in line with inflation until perpetuity. COST: R&D AND COST OF GOODS SOLD When forecasting R&D and COGS, opting for less granularity I followed historic trends and took the historical averages. MARKETING When forecasting Marketing, “Operating expenses were up 5%, excluding our fourth quarter restructuring charge. Our people costs increased as we continue to invest behind our portfolio, and we also saw higher marketing spend to support new releases.” - 2023 Q4 Earnings conference. I assume that Marketing will increase to an elevated level to support more marketing for older flagship IPs and remain elevated till perpetuity. G&A When forecasting G&A, given that EA has stated their desire to build out communities rather than developing more and more different kinds of games, I assume that G&A remains constant till perpetuity. OTHERS When forecasting Others, I opted to follow historic trends and assumed that it would continue till perpetuity.

I believe that EA is overpriced and their IPs are not as valuable as Investors make them out to be, especially after considering the fact that there is high uncertainty revolving around their most successful IP, FIFA. The uncertainty of how successful their main IPs like Apex Legends, Starwars, and Battlefield can be after the shift in business model leads me to believe that the stock is overvalued.

I think they should be pivoting towards the models of bigger companies like what Riot and Valve did with League and CSGO.Here's the thing, I agree with you. I also think they have been doing that with Apex to great success. I also believe they are building their next The Sims game to be a live-service game, free for anyone to download and play but pushing microtransactions.The problem with that approach though cannot be overstated. League and CSGO are in a different league of their own due to the approach they have. The franchises EA has are not akin to that of CSGO and League. EA's franchises are more akin Destiny, which has been profitable as its own thing for years now. I think adopting Destiny's approach to live service can be very dangerous as well. I believe individual releases every couple years makes significantly more profit over time than just holding one live service game akin to CSGO. From what I seen, CSGO makes around half a billion dollars or so per year, and that's one of the most played freemium games out there. Call of Duty, which doesn't see those player counts remain that high, derives much more profits with their yearly releases. Battlefield 2042 tried to be a live-service game a bit, and it failed big time. It's not something easy to replicate. Anthem, another one of EA's franchises, that was the Destiny close, failed to do that as well.Another point I would make is, the reason why FIFA makes EA so much money is because of yearly releases. Was it a live service, it would do well, but it would not come even close to the amount of money they generate with yearly releases. IMO the reason Valve has CSGO be a thing is cuz they themselves are pretty lazy and don't really like to spend money making games given they essentially hold the biggest PC marketplace. They are happy sitting on piles of cash with no real incentive to produce anything. EA's business position is very different.EA already has Apex going for them, now they need to figure out how best to bring it up to speed.Yup. I think Apex has by far the most potential. I think they could even take that franchise and make different types of games from it. For example, make a League of Legends-type of game using the characters. They could certainly make tv shows with Netflix to boost popularity in the franchise. League of Legends did that with Arcane and was ridiculously successful. Cyberpunk 2077 did it as well and got a huge boost in sales and popularity. EA needs to take down notes and get to work. I think a game like The Sims and Apex have much more potential than what they are being squeezed for. With other franchises, like Mass Effect, EA Sports division or even Battlefield, I think this approach fails really badly.",2,0.524,NEGATIVE,1.0
