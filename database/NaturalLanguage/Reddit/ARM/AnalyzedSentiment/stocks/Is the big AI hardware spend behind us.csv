Phase 1 hardware accumulation coming to an end Phase 2 software development starting to ramp up","This is the stocks sub, so this is a different audience than I'm used in regard to AI, I usually read a lot of stuff in the programming space. If you are just trying to chase the AI wave of investment money I can't really help you. Speculative bets on companies trying to apply AI to their current business are akin to putting money on the roulette table IMO. Or more accurately you're putting some money down on a headline and hoping when the next headline appears someone else will buy your stock for more.If you want to invest in the products and applications of AI, the more tangible players are limited right now. I think most companies investing are going to discover that LLMs are more limited in application than they thought. It'll turn out that putting an LLM next to their current business process doesn't just magically make everything faster or more cost effective. IMO its akin to hiring last season's MVP for the NFL and making them a top executive at your company. They are undeniably a top player in their field, but they probably don't know shit about running a major corporation. So you end up spending a ton of money in this exercise to just discover that maybe AI wasn't the right fit for your company's product. This exact same thing happened a few years ago when everyone went nuts over Web 3.0 aka blockchain. It turns out that blockchain is very slow and has a very limited application space. If your product boils down to getting results quickly to a customer on the web, your best bet is still a classic server + database + frontend architecture that we've been iterating on since the 90s.There ARE applications though! Microsoft probably has the best application with Copilot currently. I'm unsure if the Office version is any good, haven't used it, but the coding version is very helpful and I'll advocate it at any company I work at from now on. Applications where AI can help ""un-stuck"" you and make you more productive seem like great investments. There's some heated debate in the art community right now over AI-generated images, but I get the impression that AI will win over creatives eventually because it will help them produce more. Productivity boosts seem like great long-term investments. Most of my stock is in Microsoft because they saw the opportunity and the product and they've been putting massive investment into OpenAI.The issue is creating the software for actual use of AI and generating cash flow.Yes, but consider that AI software has existed for a long time. The chips took off because they made LLMs more usable. My company has been using Google Vision for over 4 years though, long before any of this current trend took off. LLMs are probably going to be an important milestone but not the only AI application going forward. Small Language Models are beginning to pick up some steam right now. They require small amounts of power and help drive data discovery in sensors. There's probably a big use-case waiting for this type of software that no one has landed on yet.Meta saying ""we are going to put AI in the metaverse"" is one of the most baloney statements I've ever heard. I have no idea what any of that means and it sounds like something out of a satire. Watch who you listen to in the space, there are many snake oil salesmen.",0,0.547,NEGATIVE,0.999

Phase 1 hardware accumulation coming to an end Phase 2 software development starting to ramp up","It is objectively true that, eventually, NVDA's forward guidance will be lackluster as they run out of major customers.This is true primarily on the simple fact that most of NVDA's main customers are large conglomerates, whether that be world governments or mega corporations. Eventually, META will have enough chips; MSFT will too; GOOG all the same.All of these world govs and corporations are also very aware that NVDA has a disgustingly good profit margin, and so they will seek to make their own chips and are likely already investing money into that right now.It's also true that NVDA could continue to outperform in the short term, but make no mistake that any outperformance is because of rewarding investors for taking massive risk.Based solely on forward PE ratio alone, NVDA is actually one of the cheaper mega tech stocks right now. It is cheap for a reason though. Even though I do agree that NVDA is nothing like TSLA at the prime, there are some important characteristics that are shared between NVDA's current share price and TSLA's peak in 2021 - which is that competition will come eventually, and start eating away at the asinine profit margins that NVDA currently has.I would not be shocked whatsoever if NVDA's share price has not peaked yet. I think it goes 15-30% over $1K, either before or after earnings, then starts to pull back to make low 900s, ultimately going flat again until the next earnings report with bad forward guidance, which will send the price back to low 700s and then eventually it will settle in 500-700 range probably for a couple of years, fluctuating as earnings change the narrative constantly.It will be hard to value in the short to medium term, which should be great for traders",1,0.529,NEGATIVE,1.0

The more hardware you have, the more experiments you can run, which matters if you're competing with other companies to create the best models. So arguably, a lot of the hardware demand is for doing the software development.Scale seems to be the single most important factor in determining a model's ""intelligence"", so I expect we'll see exponential growth, i.e. in 10 years there will be individual models so enormous that it'd take all the hardware in existence today to train/run them.
