Setting aside that the reddit hivemind is often wrong because price drives sentiment here, not fundamentals - You would get more value after doing your own research and making a post asking for feedback about 2 or 3 companies you are debating between.My main concern here is that you have to understand what you own before you own it. If it drops 30% on some news will you know to keep holding because it is an overreaction by the market? Or will you know to sell it because it turns out their competitor is taking market share?Best advice I can give is to buy an index fund until you understand how to read financial statements. Once you learn that start investing small amounts in a few companies. Track how they do over time by reading earnings reports and press releases. Put more money into your winners if they execute on your thesis and let your losers wither or sell.
