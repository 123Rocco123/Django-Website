Utilizing an expensive LLM to generate billions of random molecules doesn't seem to add much to existing algorithms. It may be somewhat useful for academics that are exploring completely unknown biochemical pathways that will eventually open up new categories of drugs to the private sector, but these researchers will also be limited by the amount of funding they can get to research the limitless number of AI-generated molecules, most of which are probably useless.Moreover, AI can do little to reduce risk of unintended consequences of a treatment because it is by definition limited by the available data. Once a new drug is in the human body, it is at the mercy of potentially billions of interactions that no existing data exists to feed into predictive algorithms. The recent failures of drug candidates from companies like Benevolent AI show that not even molecules showing early stage success with AI design are safe from late stage failure due to unforeseen interactions, which is even more devastating for a drug startup.",0,0.526,NEGATIVE,1.0

,Everyone is looking for the next thing in Al right now. I think after this move on $SMCI we'll have to look for another play. $SMCI has a tiny float that no one seems to understand from what I can tell. They also don’t have a large market cap just a high stock price due to their smaller float. $MU has earnings next week if it's good we can get a good move up like $NVDA had initially during the start of this crazy run. $ARM has no history so people can be playing the upside future. What are you all looking at as the next big mover ?,"next big movers IMO will be in the software side of the AI theme or a company that uses AI / Robotics for medical issues, like neuralink",0,0.602,POSITIVE,0.834
