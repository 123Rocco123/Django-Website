,"According to Reuters reports, Intel's CEO Pat Gelsinger and other key executives are to present their plan to trim Intel's fat and course-correct the company. The meeting will focus on removing assets and reducing costs, with items of discussion apparently including Intel's upcoming Magdeburg, Germany fab and its ownership of Altera. Intel announced a $1.6 billion loss in its now-infamous August 1 earnings call, which also carried the news that Intel had laid off 15% of its workforce and aims to reduce spending by $10 billion by 2025. The loss came thanks to Intel's falling behind in the AI arms race and its 13th/14th-generation widespread CPU failures. Intel stock had its worst day in 50 years immediately following the call, and the company has continued to suffer in the month since. Chip industry legend Lip-Bu Tan resigned from the board of executives, resulting in a 6% drop in Intel stock and a significant lack of industry experience. Significant changes to Intel were always likely to reverse this major downturn, but recent reports reveal that Gelsinger's plans may include seriously drastic measures. Construction on Intel's upcoming Magdeburg chip fab is expected to be paused or canceled, leaving the $32 billion project unfinished. Magdeburg's local government has already begun drafting plans in case Intel withdraws its commitment to the project. Intel is also likely to sell off its ownership of Altera, its programmable chip business, which is currently a fully spun-off company owned solely by Intel. Altera has been an industry fixture for decades, with Intel investing heavily in reviving Altera after acquiring the company in 2015. Altera has been a part of Intel's broad market strategy for ten years but is likely to be entirely sold off to another interested chip manufacturer in the coming months. Unsurprisingly, Intel is not expected to entertain discussion about spinning off or selling its Intel Foundry wing. Intel's contract foundry business, one of Intel's most significant expenses, has been kept distinct from the rest of Intel's business since Q1 2024 and is considered a tentpole part of Intel's future. Two separate sources have confirmed that Intel will not propose any plans to sell its foundry wing to TSMC or another similar buyer, keeping it around for the day it is hopefully as profitable as Gelsinger believes it can be. Intel's sharp decline can be attributed to several factors. Lip-Bu Tan reportedly blamed his exit from Intel on a bloated workforce, and Gelsinger blamed expenditures across the board as a major problem. Intel is still mired in issues related to the instability and failure rate of 13th and 14th Generation CPUs, which could lead to permanent chip damage. Tech media heavily reported Intel's lethargic response to a disastrous product failure, leading to increased public distrust of Intel's brand. While selling off companies will help quell Intel's bleeding out; the company has a long road ahead to stability. https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/intel-ceo-will-reportedly-present-plans-to-cut-assets-at-an-emergency-board-meeting-chipmaker-may-put-dollar32b-magdeburg-plant-on-hold-and-sell-off-altera","$1.6b loss, dude still gonna get like $30m in bonus comp this year",0,0.561,NEGATIVE,1.0

Intel announced a $1.6 billion loss in its now-infamous August 1 earnings call, which also carried the news that Intel had laid off 15% of its workforce and aims to reduce spending by $10 billion by 2025. The loss came thanks to Intel's falling behind in the AI arms race and its 13th/14th-generation widespread CPU failures.

Significant changes to Intel were always likely to reverse this major downturn, but recent reports reveal that Gelsinger's plans may include seriously drastic measures. Construction on Intel's upcoming Magdeburg chip fab is expected to be paused or canceled, leaving the $32 billion project unfinished. Magdeburg's local government has already begun drafting plans in case Intel withdraws its commitment to the project. Intel is also likely to sell off its ownership of Altera, its programmable chip business, which is currently a fully spun-off company owned solely by Intel. Altera has been an industry fixture for decades, with Intel investing heavily in reviving Altera after acquiring the company in 2015.

Two separate sources have confirmed that Intel will not propose any plans to sell its foundry wing to TSMC or another similar buyer, keeping it around for the day it is hopefully as profitable as Gelsinger believes it can be. Intel's sharp decline can be attributed to several factors. Lip-Bu Tan reportedly blamed his exit from Intel on a bloated workforce, and Gelsinger blamed expenditures across the board as a major problem. Intel is still mired in issues related to the instability and failure rate of 13th and 14th Generation CPUs, which could lead to permanent chip damage.

To be completely fair on Gelsinger though Intel was in a bad spot before he took over. Intel was behind its competition and had inferior products which put them behind. At least though the company was profitable and had decent cash flow. Now it doesn’t even have that.When Gelsinger took over in the beginning of 2021 he basically said he wanted Intel to be a company that both designs chips and manufacturers them. He was extremely optimistic to investors about that plan and started making announcements of building big factories in Arizona, Ohio, Oregon, Germany, and other places. In their original forecast in 2021 Intel said that the factories would start being constructed in 2021 and be built in late 2025 and start producing.The main problem came that not even Intel foresaw was a complete earnings collapse. All of the money was basically going to capex to develop these factories and nothing was really going towards their existing products. Intel fell even further behind and their products became more undesirable and competitor’s moved even further ahead. It came to a point where margins collapsed and they are basically giving away their products for a small to no profit. They also took a massive loss on their chip fab machines cause they were crap so now they have to write them off and buy new ones from ASML.Now cause of the earnings collapse they have even less money to put towards these factories and have to use every financial trick in the book to get money to fund these. One they have been using is debt. Debt has ballooned but you can only take on so much debt. Another is issuing shares. Intel has been issuing shares quite substantially but that will only get you so far especially when your stock is selling off and not desirable as is. Another is selling their ownership stakes in their factories and spinning off other assets. They basically dumped Mobileye and now they want to dump Altera.Construction was also delayed and now Intel is saying that the factories now won’t be ready until 2028 at the earliest. That also assumes no more delays. So their financial situation is only getting worse and worse and the fabs are not expected to have results until 2028-2030. Gelsingers plan only put Intel into an even worse spot then they were already in. Their financials have been the worst in decades, their stock price is at its lowest point in a long time, his promise of having results are looking even more bleak.It’s not good.",1,0.544,NEGATIVE,1.0

Intel was in trouble LOOOONG before that. I've worked in high tech for over two decades now. There's a long list of examples of Intel's own hubris being their downflow:Saw 64 bit coming and thought they could partner with Microsoft and force the market to adopt a proprietary standard (Itanium). All this did was increase AMD chip sales and accelerate the switch to Linux for serversThought that mobile/low power computing wasn't important, ignoring it for years before the iphone came out and made them realize maybe they should take it seriously. Then instead of focusing on a low power chip, theyt tried to make some x86 behemouth that no one wantedSaw IOT coming, released a few interesting chips, and completely shat the bed on software support. Getting an OS up and running literally took hours of work and that was just bootstrapping the stupid things. They continued the bs where there all sorts of proprietary hooks so it was damn near impossible to make work with common toolchains.Realized general purpose computing was a dying trend for cloud providers and learned that many were switching to custom IP blocks and other solutions. So, they purchased Altera and then did jack shit with the purchase. A few years later, they sold the company at a loss.Literally screwed over their major cloud partners MUTIPLE TIMES over multiple generations of chips. We had Intel lie to us that they sold a competitor chips with an additional core (like we wouldn't find out). We had them lie to us for over a year about a major silent data corruption bug. They famously had numerous security bugs that severely impacted performance and they flat out refused to characterize the performance impacts or let us do the characterization ourself.Created a GPU division/chip about 10 years after everyone else in the industry realized how important memory bandwidth and high core count architectures would be for cloud computing. When they launched the GPU, they focused on gaming, with no clear advantage in price (to compete with AMD) or performance (to compete with Nvidia).Here's the real issue with Intel. Their leadership is full of perpetual fart smellers. The company is full of people who think they are God's gift to engineering and if a product isn't successful, it's the market's fault for not realizing their genius.",2,0.539,NEGATIVE,1.0

,"According to Reuters reports, Intel's CEO Pat Gelsinger and other key executives are to present their plan to trim Intel's fat and course-correct the company. The meeting will focus on removing assets and reducing costs, with items of discussion apparently including Intel's upcoming Magdeburg, Germany fab and its ownership of Altera. Intel announced a $1.6 billion loss in its now-infamous August 1 earnings call, which also carried the news that Intel had laid off 15% of its workforce and aims to reduce spending by $10 billion by 2025. The loss came thanks to Intel's falling behind in the AI arms race and its 13th/14th-generation widespread CPU failures. Intel stock had its worst day in 50 years immediately following the call, and the company has continued to suffer in the month since. Chip industry legend Lip-Bu Tan resigned from the board of executives, resulting in a 6% drop in Intel stock and a significant lack of industry experience. Significant changes to Intel were always likely to reverse this major downturn, but recent reports reveal that Gelsinger's plans may include seriously drastic measures. Construction on Intel's upcoming Magdeburg chip fab is expected to be paused or canceled, leaving the $32 billion project unfinished. Magdeburg's local government has already begun drafting plans in case Intel withdraws its commitment to the project. Intel is also likely to sell off its ownership of Altera, its programmable chip business, which is currently a fully spun-off company owned solely by Intel. Altera has been an industry fixture for decades, with Intel investing heavily in reviving Altera after acquiring the company in 2015. Altera has been a part of Intel's broad market strategy for ten years but is likely to be entirely sold off to another interested chip manufacturer in the coming months. Unsurprisingly, Intel is not expected to entertain discussion about spinning off or selling its Intel Foundry wing. Intel's contract foundry business, one of Intel's most significant expenses, has been kept distinct from the rest of Intel's business since Q1 2024 and is considered a tentpole part of Intel's future. Two separate sources have confirmed that Intel will not propose any plans to sell its foundry wing to TSMC or another similar buyer, keeping it around for the day it is hopefully as profitable as Gelsinger believes it can be. Intel's sharp decline can be attributed to several factors. Lip-Bu Tan reportedly blamed his exit from Intel on a bloated workforce, and Gelsinger blamed expenditures across the board as a major problem. Intel is still mired in issues related to the instability and failure rate of 13th and 14th Generation CPUs, which could lead to permanent chip damage.

You have a stagnating/failing product. The solution is not to cut down the R&D department, that will just make it worse. I'm not sure how they did the downsizing, but there is a big problem with giving incentives for quitting voluntarily in a research organisation. All the best researchers/engineers who can find other work or do their own startups are heavily incentivised to quit. You're left with the worst people who have few other options. You don't get a more lean/quick research team, you're left with the low functioning part of your team. And that is in addition to the high quality engineers who left years ago because Intel was not able to develop new and exciting tech anymore.",0,0.529,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"According to Reuters reports, Intel's CEO Pat Gelsinger and other key executives are to present their plan to trim Intel's fat and course-correct the company. The meeting will focus on removing assets and reducing costs, with items of discussion apparently including Intel's upcoming Magdeburg, Germany fab and its ownership of Altera. Intel announced a $1.6 billion loss in its now-infamous August 1 earnings call, which also carried the news that Intel had laid off 15% of its workforce and aims to reduce spending by $10 billion by 2025. The loss came thanks to Intel's falling behind in the AI arms race and its 13th/14th-generation widespread CPU failures. Intel stock had its worst day in 50 years immediately following the call, and the company has continued to suffer in the month since. Chip industry legend Lip-Bu Tan resigned from the board of executives, resulting in a 6% drop in Intel stock and a significant lack of industry experience. Significant changes to Intel were always likely to reverse this major downturn, but recent reports reveal that Gelsinger's plans may include seriously drastic measures. Construction on Intel's upcoming Magdeburg chip fab is expected to be paused or canceled, leaving the $32 billion project unfinished. Magdeburg's local government has already begun drafting plans in case Intel withdraws its commitment to the project. Intel is also likely to sell off its ownership of Altera, its programmable chip business, which is currently a fully spun-off company owned solely by Intel. Altera has been an industry fixture for decades, with Intel investing heavily in reviving Altera after acquiring the company in 2015. Altera has been a part of Intel's broad market strategy for ten years but is likely to be entirely sold off to another interested chip manufacturer in the coming months. Unsurprisingly, Intel is not expected to entertain discussion about spinning off or selling its Intel Foundry wing. Intel's contract foundry business, one of Intel's most significant expenses, has been kept distinct from the rest of Intel's business since Q1 2024 and is considered a tentpole part of Intel's future. Two separate sources have confirmed that Intel will not propose any plans to sell its foundry wing to TSMC or another similar buyer, keeping it around for the day it is hopefully as profitable as Gelsinger believes it can be. Intel's sharp decline can be attributed to several factors. Lip-Bu Tan reportedly blamed his exit from Intel on a bloated workforce, and Gelsinger blamed expenditures across the board as a major problem. Intel is still mired in issues related to the instability and failure rate of 13th and 14th Generation CPUs, which could lead to permanent chip damage.

The meeting will focus on removing assets and reducing costs, with items of discussion apparently including Intel's upcoming Magdeburg, Germany fab and its ownership of Altera. Intel announced a $1.6 billion loss in its now-infamous August 1 earnings call, which also carried the news that Intel had laid off 15% of its workforce and aims to reduce spending by $10 billion by 2025. The loss came thanks to Intel's falling behind in the AI arms race and its 13th/14th-generation widespread CPU failures. Intel stock had its worst day in 50 years immediately following the call, and the company has continued to suffer in the month since.

Significant changes to Intel were always likely to reverse this major downturn, but recent reports reveal that Gelsinger's plans may include seriously drastic measures. Construction on Intel's upcoming Magdeburg chip fab is expected to be paused or canceled, leaving the $32 billion project unfinished. Magdeburg's local government has already begun drafting plans in case Intel withdraws its commitment to the project. Intel is also likely to sell off its ownership of Altera, its programmable chip business, which is currently a fully spun-off company owned solely by Intel. Altera has been an industry fixture for decades, with Intel investing heavily in reviving Altera after acquiring the company in 2015.

,"According to Reuters reports, Intel's CEO Pat Gelsinger and other key executives are to present their plan to trim Intel's fat and course-correct the company. The meeting will focus on removing assets and reducing costs, with items of discussion apparently including Intel's upcoming Magdeburg, Germany fab and its ownership of Altera. Intel announced a $1.6 billion loss in its now-infamous August 1 earnings call, which also carried the news that Intel had laid off 15% of its workforce and aims to reduce spending by $10 billion by 2025. The loss came thanks to Intel's falling behind in the AI arms race and its 13th/14th-generation widespread CPU failures. Intel stock had its worst day in 50 years immediately following the call, and the company has continued to suffer in the month since. Chip industry legend Lip-Bu Tan resigned from the board of executives, resulting in a 6% drop in Intel stock and a significant lack of industry experience. Significant changes to Intel were always likely to reverse this major downturn, but recent reports reveal that Gelsinger's plans may include seriously drastic measures. Construction on Intel's upcoming Magdeburg chip fab is expected to be paused or canceled, leaving the $32 billion project unfinished. Magdeburg's local government has already begun drafting plans in case Intel withdraws its commitment to the project. Intel is also likely to sell off its ownership of Altera, its programmable chip business, which is currently a fully spun-off company owned solely by Intel. Altera has been an industry fixture for decades, with Intel investing heavily in reviving Altera after acquiring the company in 2015. Altera has been a part of Intel's broad market strategy for ten years but is likely to be entirely sold off to another interested chip manufacturer in the coming months. Unsurprisingly, Intel is not expected to entertain discussion about spinning off or selling its Intel Foundry wing. Intel's contract foundry business, one of Intel's most significant expenses, has been kept distinct from the rest of Intel's business since Q1 2024 and is considered a tentpole part of Intel's future. Two separate sources have confirmed that Intel will not propose any plans to sell its foundry wing to TSMC or another similar buyer, keeping it around for the day it is hopefully as profitable as Gelsinger believes it can be. Intel's sharp decline can be attributed to several factors. Lip-Bu Tan reportedly blamed his exit from Intel on a bloated workforce, and Gelsinger blamed expenditures across the board as a major problem.
