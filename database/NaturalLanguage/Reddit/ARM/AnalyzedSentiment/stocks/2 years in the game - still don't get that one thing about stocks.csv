,"Hi, I am 27 years old guy from Europe. I've decided to learn some things about investing about 3 years ago. After the year of reading and observing stuff I've decided to put some money into the stock market. My first investment was WBD, on which I currently sit with 55% loss but that's not the main point here. I've learned some things since then, mainly about EPS/EPP/Debt/Broader market conditions/Dividends and other factors. One thing has been boggling me for a few months now. Seeing the direction the World is heading right now (everyone's arming to the teeth asap) I've decided to invest a huge part of my savings into defense market stocks (Rheinmetall, Lockheed, Northrop, General Dynamics, and even some small part into Boeing). The concern I have is with the Rheinmetall. I only get positive feedback from their actions, every 2/3 weeks they announce some huge contract for vehicles/munitions etc. I've bought the stock in March for 420 Euros per share. It then rose to 550 and has recently fallen to 470-490 brackets. It has fallen more than 10% without any bad news around the company. Can someone explain to me how exactly does it work? Am I missing something? I don't mind losing money when my scenario just doesn't play out, but when it comes to RHM nothing bad happens. I can't comprehend why the stock falls so much then. Am I just dumb to try and find a logical reason for such behaviour on the stock market? I'll be grateful for any answers from someone much more experienced than me. I really need to wrap my head around it...",Market priced in an escalation of the war?,0,0.564,NEGATIVE,0.992

Its not always the numbers or news that matters, trading and stock market also has a lot to do with human nature and psychology.People cash out sometimes - especially at a peak, i mean most of them did a 5x in 2 years. It can also be risk management, RHM became such a big % stock in a lot of portfolios that people sell some and invest in other stocks just to manage their risk and diversify.There are a lot of possible reasons, technical analysis could be another reason. Often stocks move up in a channel which you can draw on the chart and as the price reaches the upper bound of the channel its more likely that the price goes down so people sell.You just have to know there are so many reasons a price could possibly go up or down (atleast short term), that you will never understand them all.

The concern I have is with the Rheinmetall. I only get positive feedback from their actions, every 2/3 weeks they announce some huge contract for vehicles/munitions etc. I've bought the stock in March for 420 Euros per share. It then rose to 550 and has recently fallen to 470-490 brackets. It has fallen more than 10% without any bad news around the company. Can someone explain to me how exactly does it work? Am I missing something? I don't mind losing money when my scenario just doesn't play out, but when it comes to RHM nothing bad happens. I can't comprehend why the stock falls so much then. Am I just dumb to try and find a logical reason for such behaviour on the stock market? I'll be grateful for any answers from someone much more experienced than me. I really need to wrap my head around it...","Speculation over peace talks, cease fires and endgame to conflict. Simple as that.",0,0.502,POSITIVE,0.901
