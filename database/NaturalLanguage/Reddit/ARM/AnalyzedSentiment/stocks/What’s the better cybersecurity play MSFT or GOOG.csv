Basically it’s an internet meme phrase that mocks another forum or sub poster for getting angry.Specific source is most likely a gorilla rustled jimmies meme created back in the 4chan days.Example,2,0.504,1.0,NEGATIVE

And please don’t say “why not both?”","Both companies already have huge security teams. As far as I know, the security teams don't add any profit to the company. They don't sell security services or software - the security stuff is just part of the offering.If anything, I'd expect these company's stocks to go down after investing that much into cybersecurity because it's a cost. Longer-term the hope is that they get hacked less and are therefore less legally liable for any hacks that do happen - but that's hard to quantify and not a reason to invest itself.",0,0.569,1.0,NEGATIVE

This news makes me happy as an investor.They could afford a ransomware payment, but 80% of hacked organizations are hacked again by the same criminals after paying the ransom.

And please don’t say “why not both?”","Thats not what people mean when they say they want to invest into security. It means security contracts with governments and companies.MSFT is probably the leader when it comes to the server room. They are reliable albeit draconian to work with. But they are that way for a reason, namely, other companies are unreliable so to minimize that, you need to be a bit draconian. Google as a partner is just too messy to take seriously. Yes they are responsive but most of the time I have to explain their own systems to them.In the last year working with Google, I spent more time explaining to them how their own Cloud services work than explaining the errors I am seeing in their services. They usually just tell you to look at the documentation and half the time they send the wrong documentation (lol). They simply cant retain good workers because good work is not rewarded the way they run things. And their requirements for engineers are stupid. They heavily weigh memorization testing in their interviews and put little value in real experience and work ethic thus most of their engineers are just not good and have exceptionally poor work ethic once they land the job and it goes all the way up so its systemic.So all in all. If you want competent you go with MSFT. They arent perfect but their support process and workers are leagues better than Amazon or Google. For security moving forward I would stick to MSFT and Amazon would actually be my #2 choice. Google is just too flaky.",1,0.524,1.0,NEGATIVE
