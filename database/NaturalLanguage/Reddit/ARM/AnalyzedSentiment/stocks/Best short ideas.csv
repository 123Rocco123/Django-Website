As it was I sold stocks on Jan 3rd last year and bought semi equipment in mid June (AMAT, BESI and LRCX) which I held until March.Anyway, the idea is that in a rising rates environment (1940-80 & 2020-2060) oil is leading rates, forcing them to rise. In a rising rate environment, the Fed has no room to cut, so capital does not go into bonds before a downturn as was the case in 1980-2020. Rather capital goes into oil, deliberately fueling inflation and rates (and tanking stocks), and then when rate-expectations are too high, capital switches back from oil to stocks.SPX '22 earnings were 219, which gives a x19 P/E here at 4160. A 5% earnings yield on stocks is expensive when T-bills are paying 5%.Say earnings fall to 200 and the P/E multiple to x14 (a 7% earnings yield), this puts SPX at 2800.",3,0.538,1.0,NEGATIVE

I honestly doubt it and I expect rates rise slowing down following by cut. First of all, inflation is slowing down and on top of that it's a lagging indicator - in 6 months time we're gonna be close to Fed target of 2-3%. Apart from that, higher treasury yields are getting increasingly heavier to the system - interest payments on the national debt is around 2% of GDP, the highest level in 21 years.1980 to 2020 had a falling interest rate environmentThere were short periods of rates rising but the long term is down as the contemporary economy favours borrowers rather than savers and the downward trend will continue going forward. Locking in this yield in long term bonds might actually be a smart move.

ARM has designed a stackable 1W GPU that can be used in IOT for things such as autonomous driving, it will be much more energy efficient that existing tech but is some years away. ARM will IPO this year, a good thing to buy when the market bottoms. And NXP is working on in-memory computing chip with the US airforce for drones, bcs this is more faster and better than current CPUs and GPUs.About rising and falling rates environment:From 1940 to 1980 rates went up from 1% to 15%From 1980 to 2020 rates fell from 15% to 1%The yield on the 10 year Treasury bond is smoother than the fed-funds rate:https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FFbut they both follow the same long trends.In the 40s, 50,s 60s and 70s the run up in commodities, and oil especially, forced the Fed to hike, imo, we will see.I'm also short MARA since two days, it's a scam and price has been pushed up last month in order for it to tank now, it's the best short right now until BTC stops falling imo.",3,0.541,0.567,NEGATIVE

There was a big dip when the political backlash of their marketing hit and they lost sales. But I think the market is hoping the boycott/backlash subsides and their sales rebound to normal levels.

All i knew was that they had a lot of debt after all the acquisitions. But the free cashflow is very solid. 9.7 and 11.7bn in '21 and '22. Mcap is then x11 fcf and they can pay down all their debt in 8 years.
