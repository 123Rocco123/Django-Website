,I'm holding a lot of NVDA right now and I'm a bit concerned that the ARM merger might fall through which I'm sure would be disasterous for the stock (at least a big short term hit). What I've read shows the deal won't be finalized until 2022 but what concerns me is an early end from a country rejecting the merger terms. I also see now that Qualcomm has injected itself into the story. https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/08/nvidias-acquisition-of-arm-set-to-be-delayed-by-chinese-regulators.html https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/14/qualcomm-offers-to-invest-in-arm-as-regulators-threaten-nvidia-deal.html What do you guys this of the merger timeline and is there any way to monitor the progress? Perhaps this thread could keep us up to date on NVDA/ARM news.,"I'm not sure it's as disastrous as you are making it seem. I don't think ARM is priced in. If it goes through, I am sure NVDA will shoot up a bit. If it doesn't go through, I don't think anyone would be really surprised. Maybe a dip for a couple days, but no one thinks NVDA needs ARM to succeed.",0,0.525,1.0,NEGATIVE

Perhaps this thread could keep us up to date on NVDA/ARM news.,I must be the only guy who thinks that NVIDIA is getting ahead of itself in stock price. I would be surprise it'll end up in the low 600s by the end of Q2. I think the recent run up is associated with the stock split news.,0,0.564,0.997,NEGATIVE

Perhaps this thread could keep us up to date on NVDA/ARM news.,"I had ARM back when it was an independent stock. ARM chip is in everything. Then bought into TSM to at least stay close to it when it was acquired by Softbank. I found TSM a good play to keep me close to many of the semiconductor companies who outsource to TSM (like NVDA). I like ARM, but found NVDA a bit over valued for my taste. I have been buying into QCom, and smiled at the recent news that they were throwing their hat in the ring.",0,0.525,0.928,POSITIVE

Perhaps this thread could keep us up to date on NVDA/ARM news.,"ARM deal will happen eventually. When it does, NVDA stock price will climb exponentially.If not which I think is unlikely, NVDA will continue on its current trajectory which is still quite impressive. A short term dip could be possible, but won't be disastrous or long lived.Even without ARM, NVDA is in a unique position to enable the adoption of AI in the datacenter, at the edge, and in the field. Over the next several years I see its TAM increasing at a staggering rate. No question the stock costs a premium, but quality is rarely cheap. Don't miss the ride.",0,0.542,1.0,POSITIVE

There was a rally upon the news, but back in late 2020 NVDA tanked from 570 to 470 and people were saying its the ARM uncertainty/dilution of shares being priced in. Since then there has been no positive news around the acquisition, so I strongly doubt any optimism is priced in at this stage. I have only seen negative news around ARM deal since last year.",0,0.544,1.0,NEGATIVE
