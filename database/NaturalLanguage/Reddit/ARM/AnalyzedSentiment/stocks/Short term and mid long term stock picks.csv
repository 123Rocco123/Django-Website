,"Im 19yo and still relatively new to investing in stocks. Iâ€™ve been buying and reinvesting my earnings back into index funds for a year and now that I feel more comfortable with the market, I want to get into stocks. I was hoping if you all could guide me into sorting out my portfolio with short term, mid term, long term stock picks. Also, as you will see the majority of my stock picks are from the tech industry. Any suggestions on how I could diversify? Short term: Donâ€™t really know any good short term stocks. Really need help here on the time intervals of buying and selling short term stocks. Mid/long term: Please advise, Buying soon: AMD: With their TSMC and hopefully soon Xilinx buy, I hope AMD kills the chip market now that Tesla, Microsoft, Sony, and Google are starting to use their chips for cloud computing, gaming, self driving/AI etc. Elon also states that the chip shortage is a short term issue. Apple: Killing the consumer technology. MacOS with ARM and the whole Apple ecosystem is slowly going to kill Windows. As a college student, everyone has a MacBook, iPhone, AirPods. And a lot of people wear Apple Watches and are using iPads over notebooks for note taking. I highly doubt all of these people will switch over to Windows after graduating. FB: FB knows about the amount of hate they have. They are taking steps to mitigate this, seen primarily by its rebrand. The Metaverse concept is very interesting and Iâ€™m excited to see how it will pan out, especially with collaboration on work, etc. FB has all of the tools it needs for creating the Metaverse: VR, Users, and the cash flow. On the fence: PLTR: Idk if this company is a meme or not, but the governments been liking them a lot. Curious to see how they will grow with Foundry and targeting corporations. TSMC: Again, these people are killing it and have tech giants contracting with them, yet the stock has been sideways this entire yearâ€¦ can anyone explain this? ASML: Lots of room to grow, especially with their monopoly on chip production processes. Yet lots of analysts are saying that this stock is overvalued, how? Google: Waiting on dip to buy â€” strong earnings and good future with cloud computing. Costco: Need to do more research, but I love Kirkland products (sometimes more than the brand name)ðŸ˜‚ Amazon: Terrible earnings report, not good Q4 expectations. Supply chain and labor issues. Sideways this whole year as the pandemic slowly dies off. Not really feeling amazon. Other stocks Iâ€™m thinking about but have not looked into yet: CWBR, SOFI, CMBM, ODFL, INTU, DOCN, MELI, CURI, INMD, LCID, COIN, IONQUranium/clean energy.",For the long term get and forget I would strongly recommend msft it has done nicely for me so far. With google I would say you will be waiting for a dip forever and Iâ€™m sure it will go up and down slightly but Iâ€™m bullish on google as I feel itâ€™s the best business on the planet so.,0,0.526,0.994,POSITIVE
