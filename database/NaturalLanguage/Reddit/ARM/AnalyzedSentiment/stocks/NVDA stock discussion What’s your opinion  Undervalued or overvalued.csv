,"What do you think about the current stock valuation of NVDA? Assuming that they can’t close the deal with ARM. The P/E ratio is quite high. ( intel - 12.67, AMD- 38.31, Qualcomm -22.7) , I do understand that the P/E ratio isn’t everything but will NVDA be able to make 86x their current earnings ? I’ve been reading up on their upcoming projects and partnerships on their website and Instagram and seems like the company for the future. (I hold 5 shares at 602$) But! What’s your take on this Anons ?","That's an incredibly high cost basis. They announced a new CPU for servers. So that's priced in. I am not sure whether market has priced in the ARM deal falling out. For the stock to go higher, they would have to blowout the earnings completely and the expectations are already very high. My personal opinion is, it's a bit frothy right now. It moved to $460 just on fears of rising interest rates. So the downside might be substantial if some bad news breaks. If you are willing to hold 3-4 years it would recover but not sure about short term upside..",0,0.545,1.0,NEGATIVE

What’s your take on this Anons ?","Peter Lynch's ""rule of thumb"" for high PEs is that if you expect the company to grow earnings at a greater percentage than the PE in the next 3-5 years, it might be a good idea.For me the question is then, do we as investors think that NVDA's earnings will double in 3 years? if so, it is a FAIR price for the current valuation. If that growth is expected to continue, then yes, the price of the stock is worth it.NVDA has a lot of demand for their products, which is great. However, I think that with a resurgent AMD I dont think NVDA can double its earnings in 3 years, depite the hype and despite noting for sure that yes, NVDA is a great company making a great product.",1,0.577,0.994,NEGATIVE

It's not exact, it changes based on gc content, but it's a decent approximation.Where pe of 10 describes 10 years for the company to earn the equivalent $ you invested with present earnings, a pe of75 would take 75 years unless it grows substantially. If it grows it's earnings even 30% per year, huge growth, sustained, the PE will only drop to about 20.If nvdia does not grow 5x it's earnings the stock is too expensive right now relative to other stocks, save by paper value only. Aka, gambling on sentiment rather than returns. Maybe that works for a year or 5 but the market has repeatedly shown that company earnings eventually dictate stock price.",3,0.579,1.0,NEGATIVE

Then everyone was home bored buying electronics to entertain themselves.Yes it’s damn near impossible to get an nvidia GPU right now and yes they sell as soon as they hit the shelves, but there’s less of them. Every step along the way of manufacturing these chips is being bottlenecked by the company before them.“But lower supply, higher demand, they can charge more for their chips.”I’m almost certain these companies have contracts with each other to buy materials and components from them at a certain price. Nvidia can’t charge more for their cards because AMD will step in and charge less like they did to intel with their CPUs. Capitalism.If I’m wrong about one thing it’s the contracts between companies where the companies in line selling parts and materials to other companies at a fixed rate. Which is even worse for nvidia because they would be paying more for products and having to sell them at or around the same price. Higher manufacturing costs and lower revenue due to less supply.I get the argument of higher demand higher price thing, but it’s just not how it works. Especially if the price has to stay the same and the demand is being caused by not having enough product to sell.Worst part is it will not end soon.

Nvidia has continued to be the company for GPUs for consumers. OEMs and system integrators are scared of AMD for some reason, which helps Nvidia's (& Intel's) sales.Some bearish stuff would be Apple and AMD. AMD has almost caught up with Nvidia in the last 3 years, which means that AMD will be taking market share away in the GPU market. Apple's M1 chips are the best in the market for power efficiency and relative performance, so I'd expect Apple to gain market share through their hardware.I'm holding Nvidia, AMD, and Apple at fairly even amounts, mostly because I'm bullish on those consumer semiconductor manufacturers as a whole rather than 1 individual stock.",0,0.61,0.993,NEGATIVE

,"What do you think about the current stock valuation of NVDA? Assuming that they can’t close the deal with ARM. The P/E ratio is quite high. ( intel - 12.67, AMD- 38.31, Qualcomm -22.7) , I do understand that the P/E ratio isn’t everything but will NVDA be able to make 86x their current earnings ? I’ve been reading up on their upcoming projects and partnerships on their website and Instagram and seems like the company for the future. (I hold 5 shares at 602$) But!

What’s your take on this Anons ?","They're incredibly expensive, but they also have a practical monopoly on AI training. It's not really even their products, AMD, Google, Tesla, Amazon do have somewhat comparable products and AMD might beat them in price/performance for gaming. None of that really matters due to the sheer market dominance Nvidia has.People aren't really content with Nvidia having such dominance though, many don't like their prices and I think that is driving a lot of new competitors, but so far everyone has failed trying to compete with Nvidia. 8 out of the top 10 fastest supercomputers in the world use Nvidia, 70% of new supercomputers use Nvidia, remember that GPU acceleration is only a subsection of supercomputers, some workloads only use CPU and Nvidia isn't even in that space, still they got 70% overall market share in supercomputers. These people are the ones who place one order for 10,000 GPUs for $15k a pop, just for one project or application.https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai/openai-azure-supercomputer/That's like 3% of their quarterly revenue done in one order, there's a lot of business potential with AI popping up everywhere. OpenAI I think is making bank with GPT-3 and you got self driving starting to become really popular, companies and institutions are dying to order these 10,000 GPU systems from Nvidia.Nvidia's gross margins are really ridiculous at +65%, and 41% operating margin is also crazy, their growth is crazy. In data center they grew 97%, over 5 years they're average growth in data center has been 82%, their revenue growth overall grew 61% Y/Y.With the silicon shortage I think people have started to accept the higher prices for GPUs as well. On the silicon side, investment keeps increasing and there's a great roadmap for the next 5 years, generation performance increase will remain strong. Nvidia is spending $4 billion on R&D, 23% of net revenue which is another great long term sign, they really keep making great products. They got their co-founder as CEO Jensen Huang, and he's got a master's in electrical engineering from Stanford.Their stock price really is outrageous, but if there's one company who deserves it, it's Nvidia because they're doing everything right. I sold out of them when the arm deal seemed to stall out, but I think it's probably time to back in because people seem to have gotten over that.",0,0.56,0.991,NEGATIVE
