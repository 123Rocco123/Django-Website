,"Good evening everyone and thank you so much for taking your time to read my post. I have seen Up Fintech (TIGR) covered just a few times in several months but since they had a very good earnings report this past Friday I think it is important to have a review. TIGR is based in China but also has other arms in East Asia, Singapore as well. They grew sales the 1st quarter at 250% and made a profit, and this 2nd quarter 100% and lost 2.5 cents. They are actually growing much faster than any US broker, including Robinhood and are going to make some serious profits far sooner!!! If your gripe is it being a Chinese company, and you do not want to invest, I understand, but do keep in mind this stock has been crushed with BABA, DIDI and the like….Also, this loss was due to add spending which increased from 2.8 million to 24 million but growing accounts by more than 300%!! Actually, this was $25 a share April/May before Archegos debacle and then Chinse fall out… .this crashed under 13 as well….Then when they crushed earnings this went from 12-30 in a few weeks! This was trading around 23-24….Goldman Sachs actually put a sell rating with a target of $21….. It started to come down…. DIDI Ipoed in the US, on a Wednesday and that weekend China came down on DIDI hard…. Everything ADR even CPNG fell like a brick. They have not recovered since. What you should ask yourself is what a company is worth that is growing sales at 100%, grew accounts by 300% and stands to make between .50-.75 cents. Generally speaking with this type of growth it is easy to say that a 50x PE ratio can be given… Take 50 cents x 50 and that is 25 dollars….. Some highlights from the most recent report. You also check last report of 250%! Growth!!! But I know this market is what have you done for me lately, so I will touch on this past quarter. During the second quarter, the total number of funded accounts increased to 529,100. The Company added more funded accounts in the first six months of 2021 than it did in its entire cumulative operating history. The total account balance increased 188.9% year-over-year to US$23.9 billion as the Company continued to attract new clients from multiple international markets. In Singapore, UP Fintech's local subsidiary, Tiger Brokers (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., launched new products and in-APP functions such as an industry heatmap, Mini USD/CNH futures, and OSE futures, supplementing the wide range of analytical tools and securities trading functions available on the Company's platform. We added 153,100 funded accounts in the second quarter, an increase of 353.5% year over year and 30.4% quarter over quarter; of these newly acquired accounts, over 60% came from international markets. Total account balance reached US$23.9 billion despite challenging market conditions, nearly triple that of the same period last year and 11.8% increase from the first quarter of this year. Total revenues were US$60.2 million, a 98.7% increase from the second quarter of 2020. We increased investment in self clearing, user acquisition and talent recruiting, which are essential to our future growth, which resulted in increasing operating costs and expenses compared to same quarter last year. Outside of this being an ADR, I am not sure why anyone would be negative on it.

TIGR is based in China but also has other arms in East Asia, Singapore as well. They grew sales the 1st quarter at 250% and made a profit, and this 2nd quarter 100% and lost 2.5 cents. They are actually growing much faster than any US broker, including Robinhood and are going to make some serious profits far sooner!!! If your gripe is it being a Chinese company, and you do not want to invest, I understand, but do keep in mind this stock has been crushed with BABA, DIDI and the like….Also, this loss was due to add spending which increased from 2.8 million to 24 million but growing accounts by more than 300%!! Actually, this was $25 a share April/May before Archegos debacle and then Chinse fall out… .this crashed under 13 as well….Then when they crushed earnings this went from 12-30 in a few weeks! This was trading around 23-24….Goldman Sachs actually put a sell rating with a target of $21….. It started to come down…. DIDI Ipoed in the US, on a Wednesday and that weekend China came down on DIDI hard…. Everything ADR even CPNG fell like a brick. They have not recovered since. What you should ask yourself is what a company is worth that is growing sales at 100%, grew accounts by 300% and stands to make between .50-.75 cents. Generally speaking with this type of growth it is easy to say that a 50x PE ratio can be given… Take 50 cents x 50 and that is 25 dollars….. Some highlights from the most recent report. You also check last report of 250%! Growth!!! But I know this market is what have you done for me lately, so I will touch on this past quarter. During the second quarter, the total number of funded accounts increased to 529,100. The Company added more funded accounts in the first six months of 2021 than it did in its entire cumulative operating history. The total account balance increased 188.9% year-over-year to US$23.9 billion as the Company continued to attract new clients from multiple international markets. In Singapore, UP Fintech's local subsidiary, Tiger Brokers (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., launched new products and in-APP functions such as an industry heatmap, Mini USD/CNH futures, and OSE futures, supplementing the wide range of analytical tools and securities trading functions available on the Company's platform. We added 153,100 funded accounts in the second quarter, an increase of 353.5% year over year and 30.4% quarter over quarter; of these newly acquired accounts, over 60% came from international markets. Total account balance reached US$23.9 billion despite challenging market conditions, nearly triple that of the same period last year and 11.8% increase from the first quarter of this year. Total revenues were US$60.2 million, a 98.7% increase from the second quarter of 2020. We increased investment in self clearing, user acquisition and talent recruiting, which are essential to our future growth, which resulted in increasing operating costs and expenses compared to same quarter last year. Outside of this being an ADR, I am not sure why anyone would be negative on it. Please share and thanks.",Anything Chinese people touch is dogshit just like their food,2,0.501,0.993,NEGATIVE

Actually, this was $25 a share April/May before Archegos debacle and then Chinse fall out… .this crashed under 13 as well….Then when they crushed earnings this went from 12-30 in a few weeks! This was trading around 23-24….Goldman Sachs actually put a sell rating with a target of $21….. It started to come down…. DIDI Ipoed in the US, on a Wednesday and that weekend China came down on DIDI hard…. Everything ADR even CPNG fell like a brick. They have not recovered since. What you should ask yourself is what a company is worth that is growing sales at 100%, grew accounts by 300% and stands to make between .50-.75 cents. Generally speaking with this type of growth it is easy to say that a 50x PE ratio can be given… Take 50 cents x 50 and that is 25 dollars….. Some highlights from the most recent report. You also check last report of 250%! Growth!!! But I know this market is what have you done for me lately, so I will touch on this past quarter. During the second quarter, the total number of funded accounts increased to 529,100. The Company added more funded accounts in the first six months of 2021 than it did in its entire cumulative operating history. The total account balance increased 188.9% year-over-year to US$23.9 billion as the Company continued to attract new clients from multiple international markets. In Singapore, UP Fintech's local subsidiary, Tiger Brokers (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., launched new products and in-APP functions such as an industry heatmap, Mini USD/CNH futures, and OSE futures, supplementing the wide range of analytical tools and securities trading functions available on the Company's platform. We added 153,100 funded accounts in the second quarter, an increase of 353.5% year over year and 30.4% quarter over quarter; of these newly acquired accounts, over 60% came from international markets. Total account balance reached US$23.9 billion despite challenging market conditions, nearly triple that of the same period last year and 11.8% increase from the first quarter of this year. Total revenues were US$60.2 million, a 98.7% increase from the second quarter of 2020. We increased investment in self clearing, user acquisition and talent recruiting, which are essential to our future growth, which resulted in increasing operating costs and expenses compared to same quarter last year. Outside of this being an ADR, I am not sure why anyone would be negative on it. Please share and thanks.",Right to the point. A correct one at least.,1,0.522,0.999,POSITIVE
,"Good evening everyone and thank you so much for taking your time to read my post. I have seen Up Fintech (TIGR) covered just a few times in several months but since they had a very good earnings report this past Friday I think it is important to have a review. TIGR is based in China but also has other arms in East Asia, Singapore as well. They grew sales the 1st quarter at 250% and made a profit, and this 2nd quarter 100% and lost 2.5 cents. They are actually growing much faster than any US broker, including Robinhood and are going to make some serious profits far sooner!!!

So the trend here is pretty clear but it’s at a relatively low point considering this phenomenal growth.",0,0.518,0.982,NEGATIVE
