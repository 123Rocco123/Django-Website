I did the same for NVDL of which I have 400.I have been seeing a few people posting on WSB about ASTS. Many of them bought this stock a few months ago at only $2.34. Astounding that it has jumped so high so quick. Now that I see it here on your list, I am considering it.Thanks for the list by the way.",0,0.533,POSITIVE,0.996

I'm sure you know this but levered ETFs are subject to slippage, so be careful with NVDL.ASTS is a pretty speculative stock- I like it for trading, but as a long-term investment (I'm talking about on a timeframe of multiple years) I'm not quite confident yet.
