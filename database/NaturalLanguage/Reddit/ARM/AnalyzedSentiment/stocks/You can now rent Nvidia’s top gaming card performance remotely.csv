,"Marketplace: GeForce Now cloud-gaming platform now delivered similar performance to its RTX 3080-series of gaming cards due to its new SuperPod supercomputer. The 3080-performance memberships cost $99.99 for six months, while 2080-performance memberships are available for $49.99 for six months. Preorders for the 3080-platform start on Oct. 21 and will be available sometime in November, Nvidia said. Sounds like there will be some latency issues: The 3080-service is directed at “core or mainstream gamers,” not so much for professional gamers who rely on the fastest possible performance to make a living due to “latency,” or delays due to internet connectivity. Latency for the cloud-platform service is about 56 milliseconds, while the latency for a physical 3080-card installed directly on a gamer’s rig is about half of that, an Nvidia representative said. NVDA is up 2% today, although it's been very volatile lost few days so it's not clear it is related to this news. Some questions: Is opening up a subscription-based revenue stream a game changer? Would you use this service, why or why not? What's your gaming profile like?

Catalyst for this could be new game Releases, e.g BF in November.As well there will be use cases, e.g. 3D rendering, for which the latency doesnt matter at all. To always have the Performance of the best available cars for just 200$ a year is great.I wonder if this cloud Service is usefull for crypto mining as well.",2,0.548,0.975,POSITIVE

The actual latency would be dependent on your monitor's refresh rate. A 144hz monitor would only have around 7ms of ""latency"" (a new image is displayed every 7ms). A cloud platform would have that same latency + the network latency",0,0.538,1.0,NEGATIVE

Its not like the input is processed in 0ms. It is not taking the 29ms indicated above, so you have a point here.So if you compare cloud to physical card you have to add to your Monitor latency (same in both cases) the cloud latency (Difference to physical card) plus connection latency (internet). I would say that for 90% of people the Internet latency is the biggest point here.",1,0.505,0.993,NEGATIVE
