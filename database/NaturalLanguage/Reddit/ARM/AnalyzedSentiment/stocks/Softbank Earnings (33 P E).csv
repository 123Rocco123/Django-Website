,"I was taking notes while I was listening but I can't type fast enough to transcribe everything. I'll skim through and post the highligts. 47 billion usd net income, including one-time gain from selling sprint etc. 200 to 236 billion usd increase in NAV (including debts) over 12 months Breakdown of net asset value: 47% BABA, 25% SVF1+2, 32% other 269 billion usd equity value of holdings, 34 billion usd net debt, 12% loan to value (25% expected in normal times) 12 months ago they announced 2.5 trillion jpy on share repurchases, and 4.5 trillion jpy monetization strategy. Ended up doing 10 trillion jpy in monetizing [includes pending Arm deal], today 2.5 trillion jpy share buyback was completed, and will be retired from treasury. 2.7k jpy EPS in last year [TSE shares, not OTC], NAV is 15k jpy/share, 9.3k jpy/share [actual price]; 3.3 P/E, so it's still undervalued on paper. 1 year ago SVF -1.116 billion jpy quarterly loss, last quarter 3.590 billion jpy quarterly income from svf. Last 12 months 6.358 trillion jpy gain from SVF. Of the companies that have gone public from the portfolios; SVF1 originally invested 15.7 billion usd, not worth 60.4; SVF2 invested 1.6 billion usd, now worth 6.2 billion. SVF1: 60% of gain in value went to Softbank Group, because 40% of equity is outside investors with preferred shares and fixed return. SBG had 39% return on net equity annualized (IRR). SVF2: was all SBG capital, 30 billion usd used, 119% IRR. Latam Fund: 2.6 billion usd invested, now 4.0 billion fair value, net equity IRR 62%. 244 total investments across all 3 including deals pending closings. Companies fluffed: Nvidia, Gopuff, Better, Jellysmack, Trax, Jobandtalent Important notes from Q&A: No change in strategy with BABA, so probably mostly holding as Masa sees no fundamental changes in it as a business and it makes plenty of money. Notes that Mapbox deal with SVF unmentionable company is not announced yet (didn't comment on it specifically) but saw no problem with Softbank unmentionable companies merging with SVF portfolio companies. No expectation of doing more share buybacks, implies he would allow share price to fall further below book value of assets and focus on investing. Wants to focus on systemic approach to investing to exiting companies and create more regular pipeline so more steady revenue going forward. Says SVF2 money can be recycled easily and a 3rd party investor is not necessary, happy with amount of capital available. Downplays worries about risks of technology regulation, says he is focused on unicorns not megacaps. My take: fundamentals are good. Investors are not going to like that he no longer plans to commit to share buybacks. I'd expect the share price to fall a fair bit medium term. Masa implied high levels of confidence on BABA and Arm deal to NVDA which are the 2 big question marks right now.",Thanks for the insight but I like my banks hard AF.,0,0.503,0.622,POSITIVE
