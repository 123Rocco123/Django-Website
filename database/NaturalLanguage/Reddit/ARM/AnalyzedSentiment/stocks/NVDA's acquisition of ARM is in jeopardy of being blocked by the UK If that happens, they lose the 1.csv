I live in the UK. I can't remember them blocking a deal in many years. Its all bluster.,0,0.534,0.999,NEGATIVE

A LOT has changed since then, including company valuations. NVDA is nearly doublet he market cap from the original offer date. Did ARM gain no value in a year?Bad deal all around for the brits.

All I said was that $1.25B means nothing to the valuation of NVDA which it doesn't. I said that because the title seemed to imply that it did. Also if the deal fails meaning NVDA loses $1.25B cash in custody you know what else happens? They dont have to pay $12B in cash to SoftBank for actually buying ARM, so theyll end up with far more cash if the deal fails. If the deal fails and NVDA stock drops like a rock it will not be because of the $1.25B cash in custody lost but because a chance that the deal does go through was priced in. $1.25B represents 0.25% of NVDA's market cap, thats how meaningless it is and right now it takes NVDA only 6 weeks to make that profit. The $1.25B can barely make the stock move.",4,0.562,1.0,NEGATIVE
