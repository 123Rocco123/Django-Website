There's a lot of reasons to believe that it won't long term:The national debt is growing unsustainably fast, and the deficit spending has been propping up markets.Much of the gains of the past decade can be attributed to corporate tax cuts. If corporate taxes are increased to the old 37% level or higher, it will have a significant impact on the market. This seems very likely given the size of the deficit and the strong opposition to cutting social security/medicare/defense.Population growth is slowing, and there is an increasingly strong opposition to immigration, could create a situation like Japan's where the economy/market stagnates due to declining population.The rest of the outperformance of the US can be explained by increased valuations(higher P/E) and FX rates.",5,0.543,NEGATIVE,0.999

Do not let the short term fluctuations affect the long term goals, because in reality how the market returns on average 10% in the last 100 years its not because it returns exactly 10% each year, nowhere close.To understand if we are in a market that is overvalued, you have to understand valuation. I see many posts recently about how the market has gone up in the last year but people forget 2022 was a terrible year, so 2022+2023 is basically almost net zero. So whatever we have YTD is like the growth of 3 years, and when you think of that way, it is terrible.I quickly ran the CAGR rate from 2013 to 2024| Year | CAGR Year to 2024 | CAGR Year to 2024 (Net Inflation) ||------|----------------|-------------------------------|| 2013 | 10.50% | 7.56% || 2014 | 10.41% | 7.26% || 2015 | 11.72% | 8.27% || 2016 | 12.00% | 8.38% || 2017 | 10.98% | 7.15% || 2018 | 14.14% | 9.94% || 2019 | 11.40% | 6.89% || 2020 | 10.22% | 4.98% || 2021 | 5.16% | 0.43% || 2022 | 20.15% | 16.96% |As you can see if you did 3 years, it would show your average rate of return as 5.16% But if you did 5, it would be 11.40%, but these are such small samples.I have added the CAGR above as well, the 2nd number is the CAGR after inflation. As you can see if you look at it after inflation that 5 year return that looked great at 11.4% all of a sudden becomes 6.89%, which are below historical averages of the last 30 years which is around 7.78%Investing is a long term thing, if you easily affected by the short term fluctuations, you will not be successful in this.",0,0.575,NEGATIVE,1.0

But the Vanguard study was fairly comprehensive.There was a post on Bogleheads heads some time ago focusing only on DCA that was quite good. Took a while to find, but it's here.I also think it important to have this knowledge because people who do wait for crashes inevitably panic, afraid to catch a falling knife.
