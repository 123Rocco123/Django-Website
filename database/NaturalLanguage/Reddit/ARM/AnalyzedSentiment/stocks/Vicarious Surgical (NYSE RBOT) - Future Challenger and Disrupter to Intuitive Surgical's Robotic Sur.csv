,"Vicarious Surgical (RBOT) has the potential to be the first real, meaningful competition to Intuitive Surgical’s monopoly on robotic surgery with its robotic platform poised for FDA approval in 2023 with commercialization starting at that point. The company expects to hit $1B in revenue by 2027, which on a discounted basis to today assuming a similar EV/sales multiple as ISRG, would value the business today at around $5B, or 300%+ above today’s share price. Note the opportunity is highly speculative as the company has no revenue today and the platform has yet to achieve regulatory approval. Background: Vicarious was founded in 2014 by two MIT engineers with the vision of creating a much more simple, effective, and nimble single port robotic system for abdominal surgeries. The company is backed by Kholsa Ventures, Bill Gates, and Eric Schmidt’s family office, with Auris (acquired by JNJ) former CFO as executive chairman. Beckton Dickenson, one of the largest publicly traded medical device companies, is also an investor in the PIPE. In September 2021, the company completed its combination transaction with D8 holdings, valuing the company at nearly $1B TEV and putting ~$200MM of cash on the balance sheet. The company’s system was granted the “Breakthrough Device” designation by the FDA, the only robotic system to receive this, which positions Vicarious for a faster approval process. Breakthrough designations are only granted to devices which make meaningful technological and patient outcome leaps relative to existing technologies and solutions. There are about 8MM shares in the free float and the remaining ~120MM in the hands of longer term institutional and founder owners. The company is based in Waltham, MA (just outside of Boston) and currently has 33 job openings posted. Market: the robotic surgery market was born primarily through Intuitive Surgical’s development of the da Vinci surgical system starting in the early 2000s, which originally was a multi-port/incision robotic system comprising of 3-4 surgical arms and a separate console. The platform grew originally from prostatectomy and hysterectomy procedures into heart, lung and other applications. The goal of robotic surgery was to advance from laproscopic procedures (minimally invasive manual surgery) toward greater precision, lower complications, and better accuracy by giving the surgeon greater control (the human hand can be unstable) and visibility (HD cameras inserted into the body). Other platforms serving other niches have been developed, including MAKO (for knee replacements, bought by Stryker), Mazor (bought by MDT), Stereotaxis (EP / cath procedures), Ascensus, and Procept. ISRG today generates nearly $5B of revenue and growing at a 20%+ rate with EBITDA margins of nearly 40%. ISRG’s surgical platforms cost ~$2-3MM each. Given this growth and share gain from traditional surgery, MDT has developed the Hugo system, JNJ has acquired Auris, and Stryker has made inroads as well. The Vicarious Solution: The next stage of robotic surgery is to accomplish the same or better results but through smaller and fewer incisions. ISRG developed a single port system utilizing a 25mm incision and MDT’s Hugo system is a copy of the ISRG’s multi-port system. Vicarious fits in by providing technology able to bring the same capabilities but into a single 10-15mm incision, which results in about a third of the size of an incision from any other single port platform. Additionally, the Vicarious system has two robotic arms and a camera that fit through a single incision, and the arms have 9 degrees of dexterity with the ability to reach 360 degrees, while other systems cannot do this. Further, Vicarious’ system is smaller and cheaper, allowing more existing hospital ORs to adopt the technology without construction or disruption to the surgical suite. More on the technology can be found in various investor presentations by Vicarious and D8 as well as video interviews with Adam Sachs, the founder/CEO. In short, the Vicarious system promises to be cheaper, smaller, more nimble, and offer better patient outcomes compared to the competition. The company’s investor materials point to a third party market survey showing that the Vicarious system scored in the 95th percentile in terms of customer feedback and receptivity. Mastering single port abdominal and thoracic surgery via robotics has been the holy grail of the robotic surgery market given it reduces complications, post op recovery time, etc, and Vicarious is poised to be the solution delivering better technology with a lower price. What’s the play?: the company projects $1B in revenue by 2027, which would be about 3 years after FDA approval. Note ISRG is $5B today and likely to continue growing at 15-20% CAGR. Assuming the same valuation multiples as ISRG (20-25 times sales), that would work out to a roughly $20B TEV in 2027, and discounting this back to 2021 would yield a $5B net present value assuming a 25% discount rate. Today’s value is roughly $1.5B, so that is 3x today’s value. Even if you cut the company’s projections by 50%, you get a current value well in excess of today’s value. That’s all well and good but my personal view is this company will never hit $1B in sales. Why? It will be bought before then. ISRG has $4B of total cash and no debt. Medtronic has $11B in cash. JNJ has $25B in cash. Beckton Dickenson has $3B of cash. These and many others have a strategic need to get a dominant platform in robotic surgery and ISRG at a $120B market cap is too expensive for any of them to buy out. As soon as (or even before) the Vicarious system gets FDA approval, it will likely be bought out. Adam Sachs believes the business can be a $100B company, and I believe him given the novel nature of the technology and its capabilities. I believe the best way to play this is via the warrants which offer asymmetric upside (trade at ~$2, which is right at intrinsic value with the share price at roughly $13.50). The warrants get dollar for dollar upside on the shares through $18 (and proportional above that), so these act like LEAP call options though with capped upside at $18 as the company can redeem them at that point in time. I own nearly 500,000 warrants, and this isn’t a quick flip position, as it would take several days to sell out of this. I owned ISRG back at $40-$50/share and sold out too soon - it is now trading at $1000. The Big Risks: the obvious one is failure to achieve FDA approval. The others include the majors developing a competing option that’s even better than Vicarious, though not likely based on what is known to be in the pipeline now. Separately, there is the potential that the company needs future capital to commercialize beyond the $200MM on the balance sheet, though that should provide 2-3 years of support to get through FDA approval.

JNJ has $25B in cash. Beckton Dickenson has $3B of cash. These and many others have a strategic need to get a dominant platform in robotic surgery and ISRG at a $120B market cap is too expensive for any of them to buy out. As soon as (or even before) the Vicarious system gets FDA approval, it will likely be bought out. Adam Sachs believes the business can be a $100B company, and I believe him given the novel nature of the technology and its capabilities. I believe the best way to play this is via the warrants which offer asymmetric upside (trade at ~$2, which is right at intrinsic value with the share price at roughly $13.50). The warrants get dollar for dollar upside on the shares through $18 (and proportional above that), so these act like LEAP call options though with capped upside at $18 as the company can redeem them at that point in time. I own nearly 500,000 warrants, and this isn’t a quick flip position, as it would take several days to sell out of this. I owned ISRG back at $40-$50/share and sold out too soon - it is now trading at $1000. The Big Risks: the obvious one is failure to achieve FDA approval. The others include the majors developing a competing option that’s even better than Vicarious, though not likely based on what is known to be in the pipeline now. Separately, there is the potential that the company needs future capital to commercialize beyond the $200MM on the balance sheet, though that should provide 2-3 years of support to get through FDA approval.

With their incision size being 25mm, limited mobility of the arms, and the need for a huge equity raise, think the stock will continue to struggle as they don’t offer anything better than ISRGs system which can insert three tools, not just two, for the same incision size.

,"Vicarious Surgical (RBOT) has the potential to be the first real, meaningful competition to Intuitive Surgical’s monopoly on robotic surgery with its robotic platform poised for FDA approval in 2023 with commercialization starting at that point. The company expects to hit $1B in revenue by 2027, which on a discounted basis to today assuming a similar EV/sales multiple as ISRG, would value the business today at around $5B, or 300%+ above today’s share price. Note the opportunity is highly speculative as the company has no revenue today and the platform has yet to achieve regulatory approval. Background: Vicarious was founded in 2014 by two MIT engineers with the vision of creating a much more simple, effective, and nimble single port robotic system for abdominal surgeries. The company is backed by Kholsa Ventures, Bill Gates, and Eric Schmidt’s family office, with Auris (acquired by JNJ) former CFO as executive chairman. Beckton Dickenson, one of the largest publicly traded medical device companies, is also an investor in the PIPE. In September 2021, the company completed its combination transaction with D8 holdings, valuing the company at nearly $1B TEV and putting ~$200MM of cash on the balance sheet. The company’s system was granted the “Breakthrough Device” designation by the FDA, the only robotic system to receive this, which positions Vicarious for a faster approval process. Breakthrough designations are only granted to devices which make meaningful technological and patient outcome leaps relative to existing technologies and solutions. There are about 8MM shares in the free float and the remaining ~120MM in the hands of longer term institutional and founder owners. The company is based in Waltham, MA (just outside of Boston) and currently has 33 job openings posted. Market: the robotic surgery market was born primarily through Intuitive Surgical’s development of the da Vinci surgical system starting in the early 2000s, which originally was a multi-port/incision robotic system comprising of 3-4 surgical arms and a separate console. The platform grew originally from prostatectomy and hysterectomy procedures into heart, lung and other applications. The goal of robotic surgery was to advance from laproscopic procedures (minimally invasive manual surgery) toward greater precision, lower complications, and better accuracy by giving the surgeon greater control (the human hand can be unstable) and visibility (HD cameras inserted into the body). Other platforms serving other niches have been developed, including MAKO (for knee replacements, bought by Stryker), Mazor (bought by MDT), Stereotaxis (EP / cath procedures), Ascensus, and Procept. ISRG today generates nearly $5B of revenue and growing at a 20%+ rate with EBITDA margins of nearly 40%. ISRG’s surgical platforms cost ~$2-3MM each. Given this growth and share gain from traditional surgery, MDT has developed the Hugo system, JNJ has acquired Auris, and Stryker has made inroads as well. The Vicarious Solution: The next stage of robotic surgery is to accomplish the same or better results but through smaller and fewer incisions. ISRG developed a single port system utilizing a 25mm incision and MDT’s Hugo system is a copy of the ISRG’s multi-port system. Vicarious fits in by providing technology able to bring the same capabilities but into a single 10-15mm incision, which results in about a third of the size of an incision from any other single port platform. Additionally, the Vicarious system has two robotic arms and a camera that fit through a single incision, and the arms have 9 degrees of dexterity with the ability to reach 360 degrees, while other systems cannot do this. Further, Vicarious’ system is smaller and cheaper, allowing more existing hospital ORs to adopt the technology without construction or disruption to the surgical suite. More on the technology can be found in various investor presentations by Vicarious and D8 as well as video interviews with Adam Sachs, the founder/CEO. In short, the Vicarious system promises to be cheaper, smaller, more nimble, and offer better patient outcomes compared to the competition. The company’s investor materials point to a third party market survey showing that the Vicarious system scored in the 95th percentile in terms of customer feedback and receptivity. Mastering single port abdominal and thoracic surgery via robotics has been the holy grail of the robotic surgery market given it reduces complications, post op recovery time, etc, and Vicarious is poised to be the solution delivering better technology with a lower price. What’s the play?: the company projects $1B in revenue by 2027, which would be about 3 years after FDA approval. Note ISRG is $5B today and likely to continue growing at 15-20% CAGR. Assuming the same valuation multiples as ISRG (20-25 times sales), that would work out to a roughly $20B TEV in 2027, and discounting this back to 2021 would yield a $5B net present value assuming a 25% discount rate. Today’s value is roughly $1.5B, so that is 3x today’s value. Even if you cut the company’s projections by 50%, you get a current value well in excess of today’s value. That’s all well and good but my personal view is this company will never hit $1B in sales. Why? It will be bought before then. ISRG has $4B of total cash and no debt. Medtronic has $11B in cash.

ISRG today generates nearly $5B of revenue and growing at a 20%+ rate with EBITDA margins of nearly 40%. ISRG’s surgical platforms cost ~$2-3MM each. Given this growth and share gain from traditional surgery, MDT has developed the Hugo system, JNJ has acquired Auris, and Stryker has made inroads as well. The Vicarious Solution: The next stage of robotic surgery is to accomplish the same or better results but through smaller and fewer incisions. ISRG developed a single port system utilizing a 25mm incision and MDT’s Hugo system is a copy of the ISRG’s multi-port system. Vicarious fits in by providing technology able to bring the same capabilities but into a single 10-15mm incision, which results in about a third of the size of an incision from any other single port platform. Additionally, the Vicarious system has two robotic arms and a camera that fit through a single incision, and the arms have 9 degrees of dexterity with the ability to reach 360 degrees, while other systems cannot do this. Further, Vicarious’ system is smaller and cheaper, allowing more existing hospital ORs to adopt the technology without construction or disruption to the surgical suite. More on the technology can be found in various investor presentations by Vicarious and D8 as well as video interviews with Adam Sachs, the founder/CEO. In short, the Vicarious system promises to be cheaper, smaller, more nimble, and offer better patient outcomes compared to the competition. The company’s investor materials point to a third party market survey showing that the Vicarious system scored in the 95th percentile in terms of customer feedback and receptivity. Mastering single port abdominal and thoracic surgery via robotics has been the holy grail of the robotic surgery market given it reduces complications, post op recovery time, etc, and Vicarious is poised to be the solution delivering better technology with a lower price. What’s the play?: the company projects $1B in revenue by 2027, which would be about 3 years after FDA approval. Note ISRG is $5B today and likely to continue growing at 15-20% CAGR. Assuming the same valuation multiples as ISRG (20-25 times sales), that would work out to a roughly $20B TEV in 2027, and discounting this back to 2021 would yield a $5B net present value assuming a 25% discount rate. Today’s value is roughly $1.5B, so that is 3x today’s value. Even if you cut the company’s projections by 50%, you get a current value well in excess of today’s value. That’s all well and good but my personal view is this company will never hit $1B in sales. Why? It will be bought before then. ISRG has $4B of total cash and no debt. Medtronic has $11B in cash. JNJ has $25B in cash. Beckton Dickenson has $3B of cash. These and many others have a strategic need to get a dominant platform in robotic surgery and ISRG at a $120B market cap is too expensive for any of them to buy out. As soon as (or even before) the Vicarious system gets FDA approval, it will likely be bought out. Adam Sachs believes the business can be a $100B company, and I believe him given the novel nature of the technology and its capabilities. I believe the best way to play this is via the warrants which offer asymmetric upside (trade at ~$2, which is right at intrinsic value with the share price at roughly $13.50). The warrants get dollar for dollar upside on the shares through $18 (and proportional above that), so these act like LEAP call options though with capped upside at $18 as the company can redeem them at that point in time. I own nearly 500,000 warrants, and this isn’t a quick flip position, as it would take several days to sell out of this. I owned ISRG back at $40-$50/share and sold out too soon - it is now trading at $1000. The Big Risks: the obvious one is failure to achieve FDA approval. The others include the majors developing a competing option that’s even better than Vicarious, though not likely based on what is known to be in the pipeline now. Separately, there is the potential that the company needs future capital to commercialize beyond the $200MM on the balance sheet, though that should provide 2-3 years of support to get through FDA approval.

,"Vicarious Surgical (RBOT) has the potential to be the first real, meaningful competition to Intuitive Surgical’s monopoly on robotic surgery with its robotic platform poised for FDA approval in 2023 with commercialization starting at that point. The company expects to hit $1B in revenue by 2027, which on a discounted basis to today assuming a similar EV/sales multiple as ISRG, would value the business today at around $5B, or 300%+ above today’s share price. Note the opportunity is highly speculative as the company has no revenue today and the platform has yet to achieve regulatory approval. Background: Vicarious was founded in 2014 by two MIT engineers with the vision of creating a much more simple, effective, and nimble single port robotic system for abdominal surgeries. The company is backed by Kholsa Ventures, Bill Gates, and Eric Schmidt’s family office, with Auris (acquired by JNJ) former CFO as executive chairman. Beckton Dickenson, one of the largest publicly traded medical device companies, is also an investor in the PIPE. In September 2021, the company completed its combination transaction with D8 holdings, valuing the company at nearly $1B TEV and putting ~$200MM of cash on the balance sheet. The company’s system was granted the “Breakthrough Device” designation by the FDA, the only robotic system to receive this, which positions Vicarious for a faster approval process. Breakthrough designations are only granted to devices which make meaningful technological and patient outcome leaps relative to existing technologies and solutions. There are about 8MM shares in the free float and the remaining ~120MM in the hands of longer term institutional and founder owners. The company is based in Waltham, MA (just outside of Boston) and currently has 33 job openings posted. Market: the robotic surgery market was born primarily through Intuitive Surgical’s development of the da Vinci surgical system starting in the early 2000s, which originally was a multi-port/incision robotic system comprising of 3-4 surgical arms and a separate console. The platform grew originally from prostatectomy and hysterectomy procedures into heart, lung and other applications.

,"Vicarious Surgical (RBOT) has the potential to be the first real, meaningful competition to Intuitive Surgical’s monopoly on robotic surgery with its robotic platform poised for FDA approval in 2023 with commercialization starting at that point. The company expects to hit $1B in revenue by 2027, which on a discounted basis to today assuming a similar EV/sales multiple as ISRG, would value the business today at around $5B, or 300%+ above today’s share price. Note the opportunity is highly speculative as the company has no revenue today and the platform has yet to achieve regulatory approval. Background: Vicarious was founded in 2014 by two MIT engineers with the vision of creating a much more simple, effective, and nimble single port robotic system for abdominal surgeries. The company is backed by Kholsa Ventures, Bill Gates, and Eric Schmidt’s family office, with Auris (acquired by JNJ) former CFO as executive chairman. Beckton Dickenson, one of the largest publicly traded medical device companies, is also an investor in the PIPE. In September 2021, the company completed its combination transaction with D8 holdings, valuing the company at nearly $1B TEV and putting ~$200MM of cash on the balance sheet. The company’s system was granted the “Breakthrough Device” designation by the FDA, the only robotic system to receive this, which positions Vicarious for a faster approval process. Breakthrough designations are only granted to devices which make meaningful technological and patient outcome leaps relative to existing technologies and solutions. There are about 8MM shares in the free float and the remaining ~120MM in the hands of longer term institutional and founder owners. The company is based in Waltham, MA (just outside of Boston) and currently has 33 job openings posted. Market: the robotic surgery market was born primarily through Intuitive Surgical’s development of the da Vinci surgical system starting in the early 2000s, which originally was a multi-port/incision robotic system comprising of 3-4 surgical arms and a separate console. The platform grew originally from prostatectomy and hysterectomy procedures into heart, lung and other applications. The goal of robotic surgery was to advance from laproscopic procedures (minimally invasive manual surgery) toward greater precision, lower complications, and better accuracy by giving the surgeon greater control (the human hand can be unstable) and visibility (HD cameras inserted into the body). Other platforms serving other niches have been developed, including MAKO (for knee replacements, bought by Stryker), Mazor (bought by MDT), Stereotaxis (EP / cath procedures), Ascensus, and Procept. ISRG today generates nearly $5B of revenue and growing at a 20%+ rate with EBITDA margins of nearly 40%. ISRG’s surgical platforms cost ~$2-3MM each. Given this growth and share gain from traditional surgery, MDT has developed the Hugo system, JNJ has acquired Auris, and Stryker has made inroads as well. The Vicarious Solution: The next stage of robotic surgery is to accomplish the same or better results but through smaller and fewer incisions. ISRG developed a single port system utilizing a 25mm incision and MDT’s Hugo system is a copy of the ISRG’s multi-port system. Vicarious fits in by providing technology able to bring the same capabilities but into a single 10-15mm incision, which results in about a third of the size of an incision from any other single port platform. Additionally, the Vicarious system has two robotic arms and a camera that fit through a single incision, and the arms have 9 degrees of dexterity with the ability to reach 360 degrees, while other systems cannot do this. Further, Vicarious’ system is smaller and cheaper, allowing more existing hospital ORs to adopt the technology without construction or disruption to the surgical suite. More on the technology can be found in various investor presentations by Vicarious and D8 as well as video interviews with Adam Sachs, the founder/CEO. In short, the Vicarious system promises to be cheaper, smaller, more nimble, and offer better patient outcomes compared to the competition. The company’s investor materials point to a third party market survey showing that the Vicarious system scored in the 95th percentile in terms of customer feedback and receptivity. Mastering single port abdominal and thoracic surgery via robotics has been the holy grail of the robotic surgery market given it reduces complications, post op recovery time, etc, and Vicarious is poised to be the solution delivering better technology with a lower price. What’s the play?: the company projects $1B in revenue by 2027, which would be about 3 years after FDA approval. Note ISRG is $5B today and likely to continue growing at 15-20% CAGR. Assuming the same valuation multiples as ISRG (20-25 times sales), that would work out to a roughly $20B TEV in 2027, and discounting this back to 2021 would yield a $5B net present value assuming a 25% discount rate. Today’s value is roughly $1.5B, so that is 3x today’s value. Even if you cut the company’s projections by 50%, you get a current value well in excess of today’s value. That’s all well and good but my personal view is this company will never hit $1B in sales. Why? It will be bought before then. ISRG has $4B of total cash and no debt. Medtronic has $11B in cash. JNJ has $25B in cash. Beckton Dickenson has $3B of cash. These and many others have a strategic need to get a dominant platform in robotic surgery and ISRG at a $120B market cap is too expensive for any of them to buy out. As soon as (or even before) the Vicarious system gets FDA approval, it will likely be bought out. Adam Sachs believes the business can be a $100B company, and I believe him given the novel nature of the technology and its capabilities. I believe the best way to play this is via the warrants which offer asymmetric upside (trade at ~$2, which is right at intrinsic value with the share price at roughly $13.50). The warrants get dollar for dollar upside on the shares through $18 (and proportional above that), so these act like LEAP call options though with capped upside at $18 as the company can redeem them at that point in time. I own nearly 500,000 warrants, and this isn’t a quick flip position, as it would take several days to sell out of this. I owned ISRG back at $40-$50/share and sold out too soon - it is now trading at $1000. The Big Risks: the obvious one is failure to achieve FDA approval. The others include the majors developing a competing option that’s even better than Vicarious, though not likely based on what is known to be in the pipeline now. Separately, there is the potential that the company needs future capital to commercialize beyond the $200MM on the balance sheet, though that should provide 2-3 years of support to get through FDA approval.
