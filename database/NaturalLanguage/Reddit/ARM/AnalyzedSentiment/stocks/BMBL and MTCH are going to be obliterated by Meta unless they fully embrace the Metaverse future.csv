,"So, I've been involved with VR and AR since 2015. Not a Johnny Come Lately. One thing that a lot of people don't know is just how advanced Facebook is getting in creating state-of-the-art avatars for use in VR/AR. They've been working on this technology for a long time. [Youtube search: Facebook Advanced Avatars VR] They know that these advanced avatars are the TRUE key to the metaverse really becoming the game changer that we know it's going to be. One of Facebook's early taglines for Oculus was ""Defy Distance"". This is exactly what these advanced avatars are going to do. Imagine your Grandmother lives in Florida, while you live in California. You'd like to visit Grandma in person, but it's impossible. You can visit her with a Zoom call, and it's pretty good, but it's just not the same. You can't sit in the living room with her, and just relax and let her tell you the same story for the 27th time. When these advanced avatars become normal, and VR headsets are so much slimmer and more comfortable, Grandma can throw one on, and you can too, and you're basically in the same room with Grandma. You see her moving around. Her non-verbal communication comes in loud and clear. Same with yours to her. It's like you're really there, together. Sure, she might be a slightly polygonal, video-game version of herself, but she'll be about 90 percent realistic, which will be enough for the whole illusion to work. Now, just imagine what this technology does to online dating. It completely revolutionizes it. If you've ever used Tinder, Bumble, Plenty of Fish or whatever, you already know that there's a ton of false advertisement going on. People using photos from 10 years and 20 pounds ago. People saying that they're 5'11, but they're really 5'7. People saying they workout every single day, but they're mostly couch potatoes. In order to deal with these shortcomings, prospective daters will often try to meet for a ""coffee date"". Why a coffee date, and not dinner and a movie or dinner and dancing? Well, this is primarily because the men (and some women), want to first find out if the person is ANYTHING like they're actually claiming to be. Facebook's next-generation avatars will mostly eliminate this problem. You won't have to guess how tall somebody is really, or whether they actually work out. Whether they're super skinny, or have a muffin-top, or whatever else. You'll be able to stand toe to toe with a perfect hologram representation of them. Remember that tag line ""Defy Distance""? This is going to be more than just some goofy tagline. It's going to be real. You'll literally feel as though you're in the same room with the other person. You'll be able to pick up on oodles of information from just their body language. The way they move their arms and hands. Whether they're tapping their feet or not. It's truly going to revolutionize the online dating game, and if Bumble and Match executives aren't all over this stuff already, they're going to get left in the dust.",There isn’t even a “metaverse” yet and I’m already tired of this shit.,0,0.502,1.0,NEGATIVE
