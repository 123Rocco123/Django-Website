,"Hi all, I've been a lurker and got some nice ideas form here, so thanks for that. Now it's the time for me to give something back. I discovered in the weekend that Magnachip is being bought up in a 29$ per share deal while the price of the stock is just 24$ per share. (https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/) The deal has a definitive agreement and ""The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of shareholder and regulatory approvals"". Also ""The transaction is fully backed by equity commitments and not contingent on any financing conditions. "" The way I see it it's a 20% win in less than 6 months (they said second half of the year, so most probably will be sometime September-October-November). The risks are small: Shareholders might oppose- but this is highly unlikely given the company is 78% own by institutions and the board of directors approves the deal. Regulatory things might kick in: this again I think it's low because we are talking about a 1 bil company, not something the size of ARM. What do you guys think? I went and put 10% of my portfolio in this, was it dumb?",Sounds interesting. But what about this?https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/magnachip-semiconductor-corporation-sued-for-securities-violations-regarding-proposed-sale-to-wise-road-capital/,0,0.525,0.998,NEGATIVE

The chinese company is paying 50% over the market price at the day of the announcement. I also think they should be valued more but in an open market the value it's hard to determine so the company has the excuse that: "" we are getting 50% more than what anyone was willing to pay at that time"".I don't know if this is a solid argument but that's how I see it",1,0.587,1.0,NEGATIVE

That is a large-ish spread, so there could be something that others know. But on the surface, arbitrage happens all the time and it can be a profitable strategy.",2,0.526,0.961,NEGATIVE
