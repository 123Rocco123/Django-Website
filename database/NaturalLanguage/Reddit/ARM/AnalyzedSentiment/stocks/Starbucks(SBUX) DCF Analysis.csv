,"Introduction: SBUX has been gaining traction lately as a premium coffee experience from the United States. As the world gets richer, coffee consumption also grows (SOURCE). SBUX's expansive menu with constantly updated seasonal items creating a brand-new experience for customers, this novel experience hooks customers' curiosity and their wallets. SBUX could even operate as a quasi-bank with their rewards app and prepaid cards that allow SBUX to essentially invest this cash without the traditional risk of a bank i.e. not having enough cash on hand when customers want to withdraw their cash in large droves. SBUX is even seen as a luxury item in China, allowing SBUX to charge a premium and succeed over their closest competitor. Revenue: Overall, for revenue, I took into account how SBUX has to maintain its luxury good status and keep its prices elevated. This leaves SBUX room to expand mainly into wealthier countries. Management has stated that China has the largest potential, with China coming in second for the number of SBUX outlets opened (SOURCE). When forecasting the number of stores open, as SBUX is seen as a luxury good this may limit its expansion into the different tier cities of China or to any less wealthy country. SBUX doesn’t compete on price but rather on the experience of coffee, so their strategy to grow revenue is unlikely to include price cutting. [INSERT] As evidence of this, 86% of the stores SBUX operates in are in Tier 1 & 2 Cities in China. SBUX is only opening stores in prosperous cities in line with its brand image of being a premium brand. I assumed that in the earlier years of my forecast, the main growth came from SBUX expanding its footprints in wealthier countries. Thereafter, SBUX’s main growth driver comes from developing countries. Looking at the top 25 fastest developing countries GDP growth rate as of 2023 (SOURCE). The Median is 6.20%, Average is 10.47%. When forecasting Revenue/Company Operated Stores, I assume that SBUX’s ability to generate revenue was in line with the macroenvironment. I assume that the macroenvironment takes 3 years to restart growth. As the macro conditions lighten up, SBUX begins having a larger ticket and transaction volume. When forecasting the Number of Licensed stores, I took into account the %of total stores that are owned directly by SBUX. This ratio remained consistent from FY19 to FY23 and this ratio is important as SBUX wants to maintain >50% control as a way of ensuring quality control globally through directly owning and operating the majority of operations of SBUX around the globe. The %begins tapering downwards over time as a better macro environment will encourage SBUX to pursue more aggressive growth plans through franchising. When forecasting Revenue/Licensed Stores, I assumed Y/Y growth as an average %of the historic rate before it begins to half as SBUX in recent years experienced large Y/Y growth from closing less profitable stores globally, and over time SBUX would figure out how best to monetize their licensed stores. Cost: When forecasting COGS and others, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a %revenue based on historic averages. When forecasting store operating expenses, when SBUX increased its store count I assumed that there was some inefficiency that would get resolved over time, and on top of that as SBUX gets more efficient and franchise takes up a larger %of total store count, store operating expense which is a fixed cost begins declining. When forecasting G&A, SBUX tailors each store to cater to SBUX’s premium image. This image requires humans to upkeep, requiring human baristas to give the image of handcrafted coffee rather than a mechanized coffee machine that can be easily replicated and mass-produced. As evidence, when SBUX tried rolling out coffee machines to their stores it led to a decline in revenue as the SBUX experience was worsened. So, I assumed that G&A remains a %of historic averages for SBUX to maintain its minimum headcount for each store. CapEX and D&A: When forecasting D&A, opting for less granularity I forecasted D&A as a %of historic averages. When forecasting CapEX, I accounted for how much %earnings SBUX had historically reinvested and their %ROIC. (SOURCE) Assuming that SBUX has a higher ROIC over time due to its improving brand premium and more profitable franchise arm. WACC: US 10Y T-Bond Yield (1M Avg) = 4.03% RFR = 4.03% US ERP = 4.60% Beta (SOURCE) = 0.98 COE = 8.54% SBUX is rated “BBB+” BBB bond yield (1M Avg) = 5.45% Marginal Tax Rate = 21.00% COD = 4.31% Stock Price (5D Avg) = $92.37 Shares O/S = 1136.70M Market Value of Equity = 104996.98M FY23 Interest Expense = 550.10M Weighted Average Debt = 13.0 Years Total Debt = 15519.30M FY Operating Lease Expense = 2679.30M Weighted Average Lease Expense = 8.5 Years Total Lease = 9200.10M Market Value of Debt = 39519.25M %Debt = 27.35% %Equity = 72.65% WACC = 7.38% Conclusion: In my base case, I value SBUX at $87.09 per share. I believe that SBUX is more or less correctly priced with some momentum carried over from them beating their earnings previous quarter. I believe that SBUX is a strong brand name. However, for consumables like coffee, the ability to reinvest back into R&D and differentiate themselves from competitors is rather limited. With factors such as taste and aesthetics being highly subjective to the consumer or even being similar to their competitors. SBUX's management recognises their limited ability to reinvest and create results, so instead of destroying value by forcing reinvestments, they have decided to pay it out as dividends instead. This limited ability to reinvest has led to SBUX being properly priced by the market.

That just changed as they have some kind of automated way of prepping cold drinks that will sharply raise production capacity and speed using the same size workforce. That implies steadily rising margins.Third, the new CEO seems pretty energized.

The %begins tapering downwards over time as a better macro environment will encourage SBUX to pursue more aggressive growth plans through franchising. When forecasting Revenue/Licensed Stores, I assumed Y/Y growth as an average %of the historic rate before it begins to half as SBUX in recent years experienced large Y/Y growth from closing less profitable stores globally, and over time SBUX would figure out how best to monetize their licensed stores.

When forecasting store operating expenses, when SBUX increased its store count I assumed that there was some inefficiency that would get resolved over time, and on top of that as SBUX gets more efficient and franchise takes up a larger %of total store count, store operating expense which is a fixed cost begins declining. When forecasting G&A, SBUX tailors each store to cater to SBUX’s premium image. This image requires humans to upkeep, requiring human baristas to give the image of handcrafted coffee rather than a mechanized coffee machine that can be easily replicated and mass-produced.
