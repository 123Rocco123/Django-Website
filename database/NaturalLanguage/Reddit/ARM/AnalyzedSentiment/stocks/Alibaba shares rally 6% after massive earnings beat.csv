,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/23/alibaba-shares-rally-4percent-after-massive-earnings-beat.html Alibaba reported earnings for its fiscal third quarter that smashed expectations, sending U.S.-listed shares soaring 4% higher. Here’s how Alibaba did in its fiscal third quarter, which ran from October to December 2022, versus Refinitiv consensus estimates: Revenue: 247.76 billion Chinese yuan vs 245.18 billion Chinese yuan expected, up 2% year-on-year Earnings per American depositary share (ADS): 19.26 yuan vs 16.26 yuan expected, up 14% year-on-year. Net income: 46.82 billion yuan vs 34.02 billion yuan, up 69% year-on-year. Around $600 billion has been wiped off the value of Alibaba since its peak in October 2020, as a tightening regulatory environment on tech firms in China along with China’s strict Covid-19 control policies, and subsequent economic slowdown, hit the e-commerce giant. Alibaba shares in Hong Kong on Thursday closed higher ahead of earnings, as investors bet that that China’s economic re-opening will help boost consumer sentiment and spending, which will ultimately help the e-commerce giant. During the December quarter, China abruptly ended its strict Covid controls such as lockdowns. However, this is not likely to be fully reflected in the quarter as it took place in December. Revenue from Alibaba’s biggest business, the China commerce division, which includes its popular marketplace Taobao, totaled 169.99 billion yuan, down by 1% year-on-year. The drop was driven by a 9% year-on-year decline in customer management revenue, obtained from services such as marketing that Alibaba sells to merchants on its Taobao and Tmall e-commerce platforms. Alibaba said that gross merchandise volume — or the value of transactions across the company’s online shopping platforms — “declined mid-single-digit year-over-year, mainly due to soft consumption demand and ongoing competition as well as a surge in COVID-19 cases in China that resulted in supply chain and logistics disruptions in December.” The company said that it sees a rebound in China’s economy and consumption. “Looking ahead, we expect continued recovery in consumer sentiment and economic activity,” Daniel Zhange, CEO of Alibaba, said in a press release. Amid a slowdown in its China activity, Alibaba has sought growth in overseas markets through its South East Asia business Lazada and through global e-commerce site AliExpress. International commerce revenue grew 18% year-on-year to 19.47 billion Chinese yuan. Analysts are expecting Alibaba to see faster revenue growth over the coming quarters as the full effect of the Chinese economic re-opening is felt. Morgan Stanley named Alibaba its “top pick” in the Chinese tech sector for the first time in three years, in a recent note. Last year, Alibaba embarked on measures to control costs in order to improve profitability. The company is trying to find a balance between costs and continuing to make important investments for long-term growth. Those efforts are paying off with the 69% year-on-year jump in net income. The company’s operating margin stood at 14% in the December quarter, higher than the 3% reported in the same period of last year. Alibaba managed to reduce losses across all of its business in the December quarter, including in its logistics arm Cainiao and its cloud division. “During the past quarter, we continued to improve operating efficiency and cost optimization that resulted in robust profit growth,” Toby Xu, chief financial officer of Alibaba, said in a press release. Meanwhile, the regulatory tightening that took place over the past two years is beginning to ease, as enforcement of regulation becomes more predictable. The company is also trying to boost the confidence of shareholders amid its stock slump. In November, Alibaba said its board has approved an additional $15 billion as part of its existing $25 billion share buyback program which will be extended to the end of its 2025 fiscal year. Alibaba is also in the process of making Hong Kong a “primary” listing for its shares, paving the way for mainland China investors to trade the stock directly. However, the company said in November that the process would not be completed in 2022 as it had initially been planned.",That didn't last long Lol,0,0.56,0.906,NEGATIVE

,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/23/alibaba-shares-rally-4percent-after-massive-earnings-beat.html Alibaba reported earnings for its fiscal third quarter that smashed expectations, sending U.S.-listed shares soaring 4% higher. Here’s how Alibaba did in its fiscal third quarter, which ran from October to December 2022, versus Refinitiv consensus estimates: Revenue: 247.76 billion Chinese yuan vs 245.18 billion Chinese yuan expected, up 2% year-on-year Earnings per American depositary share (ADS): 19.26 yuan vs 16.26 yuan expected, up 14% year-on-year. Net income: 46.82 billion yuan vs 34.02 billion yuan, up 69% year-on-year. Around $600 billion has been wiped off the value of Alibaba since its peak in October 2020, as a tightening regulatory environment on tech firms in China along with China’s strict Covid-19 control policies, and subsequent economic slowdown, hit the e-commerce giant. Alibaba shares in Hong Kong on Thursday closed higher ahead of earnings, as investors bet that that China’s economic re-opening will help boost consumer sentiment and spending, which will ultimately help the e-commerce giant. During the December quarter, China abruptly ended its strict Covid controls such as lockdowns. However, this is not likely to be fully reflected in the quarter as it took place in December. Revenue from Alibaba’s biggest business, the China commerce division, which includes its popular marketplace Taobao, totaled 169.99 billion yuan, down by 1% year-on-year. The drop was driven by a 9% year-on-year decline in customer management revenue, obtained from services such as marketing that Alibaba sells to merchants on its Taobao and Tmall e-commerce platforms. Alibaba said that gross merchandise volume — or the value of transactions across the company’s online shopping platforms — “declined mid-single-digit year-over-year, mainly due to soft consumption demand and ongoing competition as well as a surge in COVID-19 cases in China that resulted in supply chain and logistics disruptions in December.” The company said that it sees a rebound in China’s economy and consumption. “Looking ahead, we expect continued recovery in consumer sentiment and economic activity,” Daniel Zhange, CEO of Alibaba, said in a press release. Amid a slowdown in its China activity, Alibaba has sought growth in overseas markets through its South East Asia business Lazada and through global e-commerce site AliExpress. International commerce revenue grew 18% year-on-year to 19.47 billion Chinese yuan. Analysts are expecting Alibaba to see faster revenue growth over the coming quarters as the full effect of the Chinese economic re-opening is felt. Morgan Stanley named Alibaba its “top pick” in the Chinese tech sector for the first time in three years, in a recent note. Last year, Alibaba embarked on measures to control costs in order to improve profitability. The company is trying to find a balance between costs and continuing to make important investments for long-term growth. Those efforts are paying off with the 69% year-on-year jump in net income. The company’s operating margin stood at 14% in the December quarter, higher than the 3% reported in the same period of last year. Alibaba managed to reduce losses across all of its business in the December quarter, including in its logistics arm Cainiao and its cloud division. “During the past quarter, we continued to improve operating efficiency and cost optimization that resulted in robust profit growth,” Toby Xu, chief financial officer of Alibaba, said in a press release. Meanwhile, the regulatory tightening that took place over the past two years is beginning to ease, as enforcement of regulation becomes more predictable. The company is also trying to boost the confidence of shareholders amid its stock slump. In November, Alibaba said its board has approved an additional $15 billion as part of its existing $25 billion share buyback program which will be extended to the end of its 2025 fiscal year.

,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/23/alibaba-shares-rally-4percent-after-massive-earnings-beat.html Alibaba reported earnings for its fiscal third quarter that smashed expectations, sending U.S.-listed shares soaring 4% higher. Here’s how Alibaba did in its fiscal third quarter, which ran from October to December 2022, versus Refinitiv consensus estimates: Revenue: 247.76 billion Chinese yuan vs 245.18 billion Chinese yuan expected, up 2% year-on-year Earnings per American depositary share (ADS): 19.26 yuan vs 16.26 yuan expected, up 14% year-on-year. Net income: 46.82 billion yuan vs 34.02 billion yuan, up 69% year-on-year. Around $600 billion has been wiped off the value of Alibaba since its peak in October 2020, as a tightening regulatory environment on tech firms in China along with China’s strict Covid-19 control policies, and subsequent economic slowdown, hit the e-commerce giant. Alibaba shares in Hong Kong on Thursday closed higher ahead of earnings, as investors bet that that China’s economic re-opening will help boost consumer sentiment and spending, which will ultimately help the e-commerce giant. During the December quarter, China abruptly ended its strict Covid controls such as lockdowns. However, this is not likely to be fully reflected in the quarter as it took place in December. Revenue from Alibaba’s biggest business, the China commerce division, which includes its popular marketplace Taobao, totaled 169.99 billion yuan, down by 1% year-on-year. The drop was driven by a 9% year-on-year decline in customer management revenue, obtained from services such as marketing that Alibaba sells to merchants on its Taobao and Tmall e-commerce platforms. Alibaba said that gross merchandise volume — or the value of transactions across the company’s online shopping platforms — “declined mid-single-digit year-over-year, mainly due to soft consumption demand and ongoing competition as well as a surge in COVID-19 cases in China that resulted in supply chain and logistics disruptions in December.” The company said that it sees a rebound in China’s economy and consumption. “Looking ahead, we expect continued recovery in consumer sentiment and economic activity,” Daniel Zhange, CEO of Alibaba, said in a press release. Amid a slowdown in its China activity, Alibaba has sought growth in overseas markets through its South East Asia business Lazada and through global e-commerce site AliExpress. International commerce revenue grew 18% year-on-year to 19.47 billion Chinese yuan. Analysts are expecting Alibaba to see faster revenue growth over the coming quarters as the full effect of the Chinese economic re-opening is felt. Morgan Stanley named Alibaba its “top pick” in the Chinese tech sector for the first time in three years, in a recent note. Last year, Alibaba embarked on measures to control costs in order to improve profitability. The company is trying to find a balance between costs and continuing to make important investments for long-term growth. Those efforts are paying off with the 69% year-on-year jump in net income. The company’s operating margin stood at 14% in the December quarter, higher than the 3% reported in the same period of last year. Alibaba managed to reduce losses across all of its business in the December quarter, including in its logistics arm Cainiao and its cloud division. “During the past quarter, we continued to improve operating efficiency and cost optimization that resulted in robust profit growth,” Toby Xu, chief financial officer of Alibaba, said in a press release.

,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/23/alibaba-shares-rally-4percent-after-massive-earnings-beat.html Alibaba reported earnings for its fiscal third quarter that smashed expectations, sending U.S.-listed shares soaring 4% higher. Here’s how Alibaba did in its fiscal third quarter, which ran from October to December 2022, versus Refinitiv consensus estimates: Revenue: 247.76 billion Chinese yuan vs 245.18 billion Chinese yuan expected, up 2% year-on-year Earnings per American depositary share (ADS): 19.26 yuan vs 16.26 yuan expected, up 14% year-on-year. Net income: 46.82 billion yuan vs 34.02 billion yuan, up 69% year-on-year. Around $600 billion has been wiped off the value of Alibaba since its peak in October 2020, as a tightening regulatory environment on tech firms in China along with China’s strict Covid-19 control policies, and subsequent economic slowdown, hit the e-commerce giant. Alibaba shares in Hong Kong on Thursday closed higher ahead of earnings, as investors bet that that China’s economic re-opening will help boost consumer sentiment and spending, which will ultimately help the e-commerce giant. During the December quarter, China abruptly ended its strict Covid controls such as lockdowns. However, this is not likely to be fully reflected in the quarter as it took place in December. Revenue from Alibaba’s biggest business, the China commerce division, which includes its popular marketplace Taobao, totaled 169.99 billion yuan, down by 1% year-on-year. The drop was driven by a 9% year-on-year decline in customer management revenue, obtained from services such as marketing that Alibaba sells to merchants on its Taobao and Tmall e-commerce platforms. Alibaba said that gross merchandise volume — or the value of transactions across the company’s online shopping platforms — “declined mid-single-digit year-over-year, mainly due to soft consumption demand and ongoing competition as well as a surge in COVID-19 cases in China that resulted in supply chain and logistics disruptions in December.” The company said that it sees a rebound in China’s economy and consumption. “Looking ahead, we expect continued recovery in consumer sentiment and economic activity,” Daniel Zhange, CEO of Alibaba, said in a press release. Amid a slowdown in its China activity, Alibaba has sought growth in overseas markets through its South East Asia business Lazada and through global e-commerce site AliExpress. International commerce revenue grew 18% year-on-year to 19.47 billion Chinese yuan. Analysts are expecting Alibaba to see faster revenue growth over the coming quarters as the full effect of the Chinese economic re-opening is felt. Morgan Stanley named Alibaba its “top pick” in the Chinese tech sector for the first time in three years, in a recent note. Last year, Alibaba embarked on measures to control costs in order to improve profitability. The company is trying to find a balance between costs and continuing to make important investments for long-term growth. Those efforts are paying off with the 69% year-on-year jump in net income. The company’s operating margin stood at 14% in the December quarter, higher than the 3% reported in the same period of last year. Alibaba managed to reduce losses across all of its business in the December quarter, including in its logistics arm Cainiao and its cloud division. “During the past quarter, we continued to improve operating efficiency and cost optimization that resulted in robust profit growth,” Toby Xu, chief financial officer of Alibaba, said in a press release. Meanwhile, the regulatory tightening that took place over the past two years is beginning to ease, as enforcement of regulation becomes more predictable. The company is also trying to boost the confidence of shareholders amid its stock slump. In November, Alibaba said its board has approved an additional $15 billion as part of its existing $25 billion share buyback program which will be extended to the end of its 2025 fiscal year.

Meanwhile, the regulatory tightening that took place over the past two years is beginning to ease, as enforcement of regulation becomes more predictable.

,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/23/alibaba-shares-rally-4percent-after-massive-earnings-beat.html Alibaba reported earnings for its fiscal third quarter that smashed expectations, sending U.S.-listed shares soaring 4% higher. Here’s how Alibaba did in its fiscal third quarter, which ran from October to December 2022, versus Refinitiv consensus estimates: Revenue: 247.76 billion Chinese yuan vs 245.18 billion Chinese yuan expected, up 2% year-on-year Earnings per American depositary share (ADS): 19.26 yuan vs 16.26 yuan expected, up 14% year-on-year. Net income: 46.82 billion yuan vs 34.02 billion yuan, up 69% year-on-year. Around $600 billion has been wiped off the value of Alibaba since its peak in October 2020, as a tightening regulatory environment on tech firms in China along with China’s strict Covid-19 control policies, and subsequent economic slowdown, hit the e-commerce giant. Alibaba shares in Hong Kong on Thursday closed higher ahead of earnings, as investors bet that that China’s economic re-opening will help boost consumer sentiment and spending, which will ultimately help the e-commerce giant. During the December quarter, China abruptly ended its strict Covid controls such as lockdowns. However, this is not likely to be fully reflected in the quarter as it took place in December. Revenue from Alibaba’s biggest business, the China commerce division, which includes its popular marketplace Taobao, totaled 169.99 billion yuan, down by 1% year-on-year. The drop was driven by a 9% year-on-year decline in customer management revenue, obtained from services such as marketing that Alibaba sells to merchants on its Taobao and Tmall e-commerce platforms. Alibaba said that gross merchandise volume — or the value of transactions across the company’s online shopping platforms — “declined mid-single-digit year-over-year, mainly due to soft consumption demand and ongoing competition as well as a surge in COVID-19 cases in China that resulted in supply chain and logistics disruptions in December.” The company said that it sees a rebound in China’s economy and consumption. “Looking ahead, we expect continued recovery in consumer sentiment and economic activity,” Daniel Zhange, CEO of Alibaba, said in a press release.

Alibaba said that gross merchandise volume — or the value of transactions across the company’s online shopping platforms — “declined mid-single-digit year-over-year, mainly due to soft consumption demand and ongoing competition as well as a surge in COVID-19 cases in China that resulted in supply chain and logistics disruptions in December.” The company said that it sees a rebound in China’s economy and consumption. “Looking ahead, we expect continued recovery in consumer sentiment and economic activity,” Daniel Zhange, CEO of Alibaba, said in a press release. Amid a slowdown in its China activity, Alibaba has sought growth in overseas markets through its South East Asia business Lazada and through global e-commerce site AliExpress. International commerce revenue grew 18% year-on-year to 19.47 billion Chinese yuan. Analysts are expecting Alibaba to see faster revenue growth over the coming quarters as the full effect of the Chinese economic re-opening is felt. Morgan Stanley named Alibaba its “top pick” in the Chinese tech sector for the first time in three years, in a recent note. Last year, Alibaba embarked on measures to control costs in order to improve profitability. The company is trying to find a balance between costs and continuing to make important investments for long-term growth. Those efforts are paying off with the 69% year-on-year jump in net income. The company’s operating margin stood at 14% in the December quarter, higher than the 3% reported in the same period of last year. Alibaba managed to reduce losses across all of its business in the December quarter, including in its logistics arm Cainiao and its cloud division. “During the past quarter, we continued to improve operating efficiency and cost optimization that resulted in robust profit growth,” Toby Xu, chief financial officer of Alibaba, said in a press release. Meanwhile, the regulatory tightening that took place over the past two years is beginning to ease, as enforcement of regulation becomes more predictable. The company is also trying to boost the confidence of shareholders amid its stock slump.

Here’s how Alibaba did in its fiscal third quarter, which ran from October to December 2022, versus Refinitiv consensus estimates: Revenue: 247.76 billion Chinese yuan vs 245.18 billion Chinese yuan expected, up 2% year-on-year Earnings per American depositary share (ADS): 19.26 yuan vs 16.26 yuan expected, up 14% year-on-year. Net income: 46.82 billion yuan vs 34.02 billion yuan, up 69% year-on-year. Around $600 billion has been wiped off the value of Alibaba since its peak in October 2020, as a tightening regulatory environment on tech firms in China along with China’s strict Covid-19 control policies, and subsequent economic slowdown, hit the e-commerce giant. Alibaba shares in Hong Kong on Thursday closed higher ahead of earnings, as investors bet that that China’s economic re-opening will help boost consumer sentiment and spending, which will ultimately help the e-commerce giant. During the December quarter, China abruptly ended its strict Covid controls such as lockdowns. However, this is not likely to be fully reflected in the quarter as it took place in December. Revenue from Alibaba’s biggest business, the China commerce division, which includes its popular marketplace Taobao, totaled 169.99 billion yuan, down by 1% year-on-year. The drop was driven by a 9% year-on-year decline in customer management revenue, obtained from services such as marketing that Alibaba sells to merchants on its Taobao and Tmall e-commerce platforms. Alibaba said that gross merchandise volume — or the value of transactions across the company’s online shopping platforms — “declined mid-single-digit year-over-year, mainly due to soft consumption demand and ongoing competition as well as a surge in COVID-19 cases in China that resulted in supply chain and logistics disruptions in December.” The company said that it sees a rebound in China’s economy and consumption. “Looking ahead, we expect continued recovery in consumer sentiment and economic activity,” Daniel Zhange, CEO of Alibaba, said in a press release. Amid a slowdown in its China activity, Alibaba has sought growth in overseas markets through its South East Asia business Lazada and through global e-commerce site AliExpress. International commerce revenue grew 18% year-on-year to 19.47 billion Chinese yuan. Analysts are expecting Alibaba to see faster revenue growth over the coming quarters as the full effect of the Chinese economic re-opening is felt. Morgan Stanley named Alibaba its “top pick” in the Chinese tech sector for the first time in three years, in a recent note. Last year, Alibaba embarked on measures to control costs in order to improve profitability. The company is trying to find a balance between costs and continuing to make important investments for long-term growth. Those efforts are paying off with the 69% year-on-year jump in net income. The company’s operating margin stood at 14% in the December quarter, higher than the 3% reported in the same period of last year. Alibaba managed to reduce losses across all of its business in the December quarter, including in its logistics arm Cainiao and its cloud division. “During the past quarter, we continued to improve operating efficiency and cost optimization that resulted in robust profit growth,” Toby Xu, chief financial officer of Alibaba, said in a press release. Meanwhile, the regulatory tightening that took place over the past two years is beginning to ease, as enforcement of regulation becomes more predictable. The company is also trying to boost the confidence of shareholders amid its stock slump. In November, Alibaba said its board has approved an additional $15 billion as part of its existing $25 billion share buyback program which will be extended to the end of its 2025 fiscal year. Alibaba is also in the process of making Hong Kong a “primary” listing for its shares, paving the way for mainland China investors to trade the stock directly. However, the company said in November that the process would not be completed in 2022 as it had initially been planned.","what do you mean?Do you not know about evergrande?https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-state-firms-takeover-evergrandes-11-bln-holding-shengjing-bank-2022-09-07/And even if they don't take it over, they can simply control how they operate completely.

Evergrande is in a lot of debt, and if it declares bankruptcy, this will piss off a lot of average people such as debt holders. I do not know the details of what happened to that company. I remember China punished their CEO monetarily. I just checked, he stepped down and lost most of his wealth, but still a billionaire.However, people are saying China will nationalize a company because it is making too much profits or something like that. I think China is smarter than people here think. My perception is they are respecting the private institutions. I don't think they believe in nationalizing everything anymore. If the CEO of a company pisses off some powerful people on top of CCP, they will most likely get him out of that position just like they did to Jack Ma, which is unfortunate.China or any other rational country must understand the importance of laws, property rights, science etc. If we are smart enough to know that, they must be smart enough to grasp it as well. This country is not Mao style anymore where everything is nationalized and micro-managed.Baba is a risky play not so much because China will nationalize it, but because further sanctions between China and the US could get us into ugly places. However, I do not think they will nationalize that company at all. When an important company declares bankruptcy, the government covers their debt and in return they nationalize it is a completely different thing. You also posted a link which says government sets up canteens. What's wrong with that if they are subsidizing some poor people?The US is a very liberal country when it comes to economy. Everyone is on their own. However, most other governments in the world are involved in more parts of their economy such as natural resources, health, education, or other social programs. There is nothing wrong with that.One could argue China and the chinese companies do not prioritize the investors. I think they would be right. For example, even though Baba is making lots of profits, they are not sharing it with their shareholders much. Share buyback is very little. However, people here talk about extremes as though this country is another N Korea, which is not the case.",5,0.54,1.0,NEGATIVE

Alibaba shares in Hong Kong on Thursday closed higher ahead of earnings, as investors bet that that China’s economic re-opening will help boost consumer sentiment and spending, which will ultimately help the e-commerce giant. During the December quarter, China abruptly ended its strict Covid controls such as lockdowns. However, this is not likely to be fully reflected in the quarter as it took place in December. Revenue from Alibaba’s biggest business, the China commerce division, which includes its popular marketplace Taobao, totaled 169.99 billion yuan, down by 1% year-on-year. The drop was driven by a 9% year-on-year decline in customer management revenue, obtained from services such as marketing that Alibaba sells to merchants on its Taobao and Tmall e-commerce platforms. Alibaba said that gross merchandise volume — or the value of transactions across the company’s online shopping platforms — “declined mid-single-digit year-over-year, mainly due to soft consumption demand and ongoing competition as well as a surge in COVID-19 cases in China that resulted in supply chain and logistics disruptions in December.” The company said that it sees a rebound in China’s economy and consumption. “Looking ahead, we expect continued recovery in consumer sentiment and economic activity,” Daniel Zhange, CEO of Alibaba, said in a press release. Amid a slowdown in its China activity, Alibaba has sought growth in overseas markets through its South East Asia business Lazada and through global e-commerce site AliExpress. International commerce revenue grew 18% year-on-year to 19.47 billion Chinese yuan. Analysts are expecting Alibaba to see faster revenue growth over the coming quarters as the full effect of the Chinese economic re-opening is felt. Morgan Stanley named Alibaba its “top pick” in the Chinese tech sector for the first time in three years, in a recent note. Last year, Alibaba embarked on measures to control costs in order to improve profitability. The company is trying to find a balance between costs and continuing to make important investments for long-term growth. Those efforts are paying off with the 69% year-on-year jump in net income. The company’s operating margin stood at 14% in the December quarter, higher than the 3% reported in the same period of last year. Alibaba managed to reduce losses across all of its business in the December quarter, including in its logistics arm Cainiao and its cloud division. “During the past quarter, we continued to improve operating efficiency and cost optimization that resulted in robust profit growth,” Toby Xu, chief financial officer of Alibaba, said in a press release. Meanwhile, the regulatory tightening that took place over the past two years is beginning to ease, as enforcement of regulation becomes more predictable. The company is also trying to boost the confidence of shareholders amid its stock slump. In November, Alibaba said its board has approved an additional $15 billion as part of its existing $25 billion share buyback program which will be extended to the end of its 2025 fiscal year. Alibaba is also in the process of making Hong Kong a “primary” listing for its shares, paving the way for mainland China investors to trade the stock directly.

,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/23/alibaba-shares-rally-4percent-after-massive-earnings-beat.html Alibaba reported earnings for its fiscal third quarter that smashed expectations, sending U.S.-listed shares soaring 4% higher. Here’s how Alibaba did in its fiscal third quarter, which ran from October to December 2022, versus Refinitiv consensus estimates: Revenue: 247.76 billion Chinese yuan vs 245.18 billion Chinese yuan expected, up 2% year-on-year Earnings per American depositary share (ADS): 19.26 yuan vs 16.26 yuan expected, up 14% year-on-year. Net income: 46.82 billion yuan vs 34.02 billion yuan, up 69% year-on-year. Around $600 billion has been wiped off the value of Alibaba since its peak in October 2020, as a tightening regulatory environment on tech firms in China along with China’s strict Covid-19 control policies, and subsequent economic slowdown, hit the e-commerce giant. Alibaba shares in Hong Kong on Thursday closed higher ahead of earnings, as investors bet that that China’s economic re-opening will help boost consumer sentiment and spending, which will ultimately help the e-commerce giant. During the December quarter, China abruptly ended its strict Covid controls such as lockdowns. However, this is not likely to be fully reflected in the quarter as it took place in December. Revenue from Alibaba’s biggest business, the China commerce division, which includes its popular marketplace Taobao, totaled 169.99 billion yuan, down by 1% year-on-year. The drop was driven by a 9% year-on-year decline in customer management revenue, obtained from services such as marketing that Alibaba sells to merchants on its Taobao and Tmall e-commerce platforms. Alibaba said that gross merchandise volume — or the value of transactions across the company’s online shopping platforms — “declined mid-single-digit year-over-year, mainly due to soft consumption demand and ongoing competition as well as a surge in COVID-19 cases in China that resulted in supply chain and logistics disruptions in December.” The company said that it sees a rebound in China’s economy and consumption. “Looking ahead, we expect continued recovery in consumer sentiment and economic activity,” Daniel Zhange, CEO of Alibaba, said in a press release. Amid a slowdown in its China activity, Alibaba has sought growth in overseas markets through its South East Asia business Lazada and through global e-commerce site AliExpress. International commerce revenue grew 18% year-on-year to 19.47 billion Chinese yuan. Analysts are expecting Alibaba to see faster revenue growth over the coming quarters as the full effect of the Chinese economic re-opening is felt. Morgan Stanley named Alibaba its “top pick” in the Chinese tech sector for the first time in three years, in a recent note. Last year, Alibaba embarked on measures to control costs in order to improve profitability. The company is trying to find a balance between costs and continuing to make important investments for long-term growth. Those efforts are paying off with the 69% year-on-year jump in net income. The company’s operating margin stood at 14% in the December quarter, higher than the 3% reported in the same period of last year. Alibaba managed to reduce losses across all of its business in the December quarter, including in its logistics arm Cainiao and its cloud division. “During the past quarter, we continued to improve operating efficiency and cost optimization that resulted in robust profit growth,” Toby Xu, chief financial officer of Alibaba, said in a press release. Meanwhile, the regulatory tightening that took place over the past two years is beginning to ease, as enforcement of regulation becomes more predictable.

He paid too high a price thinking that Baba’s moat was bigger than it actually is. I personally think JD and PDD are younger, hungrier and ultimately better companies. But Baba under $100 is still a buy in my books. The geopolitical risks are worth it at current valuations.On a sidenote it’s worth noting that Baba is still 15% of Munger’s Daily Journal portfolio and this hasn’t changed for 3 quarters now.",5,0.521,0.853,POSITIVE

Neither of those things are likely as it would be absolute suicide.The CCP takes a hawkish stance right before a big meeting. They did this leading up to Xi getting renominated for a third term.

Alibaba shares in Hong Kong on Thursday closed higher ahead of earnings, as investors bet that that China’s economic re-opening will help boost consumer sentiment and spending, which will ultimately help the e-commerce giant. During the December quarter, China abruptly ended its strict Covid controls such as lockdowns. However, this is not likely to be fully reflected in the quarter as it took place in December. Revenue from Alibaba’s biggest business, the China commerce division, which includes its popular marketplace Taobao, totaled 169.99 billion yuan, down by 1% year-on-year. The drop was driven by a 9% year-on-year decline in customer management revenue, obtained from services such as marketing that Alibaba sells to merchants on its Taobao and Tmall e-commerce platforms. Alibaba said that gross merchandise volume — or the value of transactions across the company’s online shopping platforms — “declined mid-single-digit year-over-year, mainly due to soft consumption demand and ongoing competition as well as a surge in COVID-19 cases in China that resulted in supply chain and logistics disruptions in December.” The company said that it sees a rebound in China’s economy and consumption. “Looking ahead, we expect continued recovery in consumer sentiment and economic activity,” Daniel Zhange, CEO of Alibaba, said in a press release. Amid a slowdown in its China activity, Alibaba has sought growth in overseas markets through its South East Asia business Lazada and through global e-commerce site AliExpress. International commerce revenue grew 18% year-on-year to 19.47 billion Chinese yuan. Analysts are expecting Alibaba to see faster revenue growth over the coming quarters as the full effect of the Chinese economic re-opening is felt. Morgan Stanley named Alibaba its “top pick” in the Chinese tech sector for the first time in three years, in a recent note. Last year, Alibaba embarked on measures to control costs in order to improve profitability. The company is trying to find a balance between costs and continuing to make important investments for long-term growth. Those efforts are paying off with the 69% year-on-year jump in net income. The company’s operating margin stood at 14% in the December quarter, higher than the 3% reported in the same period of last year. Alibaba managed to reduce losses across all of its business in the December quarter, including in its logistics arm Cainiao and its cloud division. “During the past quarter, we continued to improve operating efficiency and cost optimization that resulted in robust profit growth,” Toby Xu, chief financial officer of Alibaba, said in a press release. Meanwhile, the regulatory tightening that took place over the past two years is beginning to ease, as enforcement of regulation becomes more predictable. The company is also trying to boost the confidence of shareholders amid its stock slump. In November, Alibaba said its board has approved an additional $15 billion as part of its existing $25 billion share buyback program which will be extended to the end of its 2025 fiscal year. Alibaba is also in the process of making Hong Kong a “primary” listing for its shares, paving the way for mainland China investors to trade the stock directly. However, the company said in November that the process would not be completed in 2022 as it had initially been planned.",If they want any decent revenue growth in the retail section they need to improve customer service with AliExpress.

Here’s how Alibaba did in its fiscal third quarter, which ran from October to December 2022, versus Refinitiv consensus estimates: Revenue: 247.76 billion Chinese yuan vs 245.18 billion Chinese yuan expected, up 2% year-on-year Earnings per American depositary share (ADS): 19.26 yuan vs 16.26 yuan expected, up 14% year-on-year. Net income: 46.82 billion yuan vs 34.02 billion yuan, up 69% year-on-year. Around $600 billion has been wiped off the value of Alibaba since its peak in October 2020, as a tightening regulatory environment on tech firms in China along with China’s strict Covid-19 control policies, and subsequent economic slowdown, hit the e-commerce giant. Alibaba shares in Hong Kong on Thursday closed higher ahead of earnings, as investors bet that that China’s economic re-opening will help boost consumer sentiment and spending, which will ultimately help the e-commerce giant. During the December quarter, China abruptly ended its strict Covid controls such as lockdowns. However, this is not likely to be fully reflected in the quarter as it took place in December. Revenue from Alibaba’s biggest business, the China commerce division, which includes its popular marketplace Taobao, totaled 169.99 billion yuan, down by 1% year-on-year. The drop was driven by a 9% year-on-year decline in customer management revenue, obtained from services such as marketing that Alibaba sells to merchants on its Taobao and Tmall e-commerce platforms. Alibaba said that gross merchandise volume — or the value of transactions across the company’s online shopping platforms — “declined mid-single-digit year-over-year, mainly due to soft consumption demand and ongoing competition as well as a surge in COVID-19 cases in China that resulted in supply chain and logistics disruptions in December.” The company said that it sees a rebound in China’s economy and consumption. “Looking ahead, we expect continued recovery in consumer sentiment and economic activity,” Daniel Zhange, CEO of Alibaba, said in a press release. Amid a slowdown in its China activity, Alibaba has sought growth in overseas markets through its South East Asia business Lazada and through global e-commerce site AliExpress. International commerce revenue grew 18% year-on-year to 19.47 billion Chinese yuan. Analysts are expecting Alibaba to see faster revenue growth over the coming quarters as the full effect of the Chinese economic re-opening is felt. Morgan Stanley named Alibaba its “top pick” in the Chinese tech sector for the first time in three years, in a recent note. Last year, Alibaba embarked on measures to control costs in order to improve profitability. The company is trying to find a balance between costs and continuing to make important investments for long-term growth. Those efforts are paying off with the 69% year-on-year jump in net income. The company’s operating margin stood at 14% in the December quarter, higher than the 3% reported in the same period of last year. Alibaba managed to reduce losses across all of its business in the December quarter, including in its logistics arm Cainiao and its cloud division. “During the past quarter, we continued to improve operating efficiency and cost optimization that resulted in robust profit growth,” Toby Xu, chief financial officer of Alibaba, said in a press release. Meanwhile, the regulatory tightening that took place over the past two years is beginning to ease, as enforcement of regulation becomes more predictable. The company is also trying to boost the confidence of shareholders amid its stock slump. In November, Alibaba said its board has approved an additional $15 billion as part of its existing $25 billion share buyback program which will be extended to the end of its 2025 fiscal year. Alibaba is also in the process of making Hong Kong a “primary” listing for its shares, paving the way for mainland China investors to trade the stock directly. However, the company said in November that the process would not be completed in 2022 as it had initially been planned.","Never touching BABA again, learned my lesson in 2020/21.They can shit gold bricks, doesn't really matter b/c the government can kneecap them any time they want with no recourse.",0,0.507,1.0,NEGATIVE

,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/23/alibaba-shares-rally-4percent-after-massive-earnings-beat.html Alibaba reported earnings for its fiscal third quarter that smashed expectations, sending U.S.-listed shares soaring 4% higher. Here’s how Alibaba did in its fiscal third quarter, which ran from October to December 2022, versus Refinitiv consensus estimates: Revenue: 247.76 billion Chinese yuan vs 245.18 billion Chinese yuan expected, up 2% year-on-year Earnings per American depositary share (ADS): 19.26 yuan vs 16.26 yuan expected, up 14% year-on-year. Net income: 46.82 billion yuan vs 34.02 billion yuan, up 69% year-on-year. Around $600 billion has been wiped off the value of Alibaba since its peak in October 2020, as a tightening regulatory environment on tech firms in China along with China’s strict Covid-19 control policies, and subsequent economic slowdown, hit the e-commerce giant. Alibaba shares in Hong Kong on Thursday closed higher ahead of earnings, as investors bet that that China’s economic re-opening will help boost consumer sentiment and spending, which will ultimately help the e-commerce giant. During the December quarter, China abruptly ended its strict Covid controls such as lockdowns. However, this is not likely to be fully reflected in the quarter as it took place in December. Revenue from Alibaba’s biggest business, the China commerce division, which includes its popular marketplace Taobao, totaled 169.99 billion yuan, down by 1% year-on-year. The drop was driven by a 9% year-on-year decline in customer management revenue, obtained from services such as marketing that Alibaba sells to merchants on its Taobao and Tmall e-commerce platforms. Alibaba said that gross merchandise volume — or the value of transactions across the company’s online shopping platforms — “declined mid-single-digit year-over-year, mainly due to soft consumption demand and ongoing competition as well as a surge in COVID-19 cases in China that resulted in supply chain and logistics disruptions in December.” The company said that it sees a rebound in China’s economy and consumption. “Looking ahead, we expect continued recovery in consumer sentiment and economic activity,” Daniel Zhange, CEO of Alibaba, said in a press release. Amid a slowdown in its China activity, Alibaba has sought growth in overseas markets through its South East Asia business Lazada and through global e-commerce site AliExpress. International commerce revenue grew 18% year-on-year to 19.47 billion Chinese yuan. Analysts are expecting Alibaba to see faster revenue growth over the coming quarters as the full effect of the Chinese economic re-opening is felt. Morgan Stanley named Alibaba its “top pick” in the Chinese tech sector for the first time in three years, in a recent note. Last year, Alibaba embarked on measures to control costs in order to improve profitability. The company is trying to find a balance between costs and continuing to make important investments for long-term growth. Those efforts are paying off with the 69% year-on-year jump in net income. The company’s operating margin stood at 14% in the December quarter, higher than the 3% reported in the same period of last year. Alibaba managed to reduce losses across all of its business in the December quarter, including in its logistics arm Cainiao and its cloud division. “During the past quarter, we continued to improve operating efficiency and cost optimization that resulted in robust profit growth,” Toby Xu, chief financial officer of Alibaba, said in a press release.
