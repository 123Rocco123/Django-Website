,"I’ve been trying to figure out what’s going on with Andy Jassy, the recently appointed $AMZN CEO. Some with zero knowledge of finance state that the CEO should not care about the stock performance, whereas in reality stock owners appoint and maintain Andy in the job in the first place. My personal theory is that, coming from the AWS division, he is overwhelmed by the burden of the distribution arm. Obviously the existing supply chain constrain does not help, but this is affecting the whole world, not only $AMZN. How long do you think he has before Jeff Bezos gets tired of losing millions every week and sacks him? I’m not sure the grace period in a company like Amazon is generous whatsoever.",Remember Andy is the one who founded AWS. Thats exactly where Amazon is headed towards and Bezos knows that which is why he put Andy at the head. AWS 40% growth last ER.,0,0.527,0.618,POSITIVE

However, my question goes more in the direction of keeping the distribution beast under control and not letting it run down the whole conglomerate.",1,0.509,0.703,POSITIVE
