,"Edit: People are very confused about how ARM licensing works. Read this explanation first: ARM licenses its ISA and/or stock CPU designs to companies. Some companies license both. They pay more. Some companies only license the ISA. They pay less. Apple only licenses the ISA, for example. Apple's ARM-based designs actually compete with ARM's stock designs. This is why your iPhone is always faster than Android phones. Yes, Apple is both a customer and a competitor to ARM. Stock ARM chips are used by companies like Qualcomm, Mediatek, etc. But slowly, these companies are moving away from them and they're designing their own ARM-based chips. This means ARM will make less money from them and they too, will become both customers and competitors to ARM. ARM's biggest customers are an existential threat to ARM's most profitable business. I'm not buying. While I believe that ARM CPUs will continue to take marketshare away from x86 on laptops, desktops, and servers, I don't believe the company will be that profitable. Despite licensing its IP and being at the core of the mobile world, ARM's business model makes peanuts compared to Apple, Qualcomm, AMD, Intel, Nvidia. ARM's last reported revenue was $2b/year. Apple makes that in 1.5 days. Microsoft makes 88x more. Intel makes 39x more. Qualcomm makes 17x more. In essence, ARM can't compete with the big boys and far more profitable companies are poaching their talent. Take for example, Mike Filippo, a lead architect at ARM, was poached by Apple then poached by Microsoft. ARM simply can't compete with the money that big tech can throw at their top employees. If you're a top student graduate, you're going to Apple/Intel/AMD/Nvidia. You're not going to ARM Austin Texas. Whenever a big tech company wants to build a custom ARM chip, they go raid ARM talent. This basically means ARM won't be able to match the performance of big tech designs with their stock ARM cores. And it shows because Apple Silicon is far ahead of stock ARM cores, Qualcomm themselves will be building custom ARM cores again, and Ampere is ditching stock ARM cores for their own custom server cores. Companies that only rely on the ARM ISA pay far less in licensing fees than companies that also license ARM core designs. Nvidia buying ARM would have injected the capital needed to compete with Apple, Qualcomm, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, AMD, Intel designs and future designs. And it would have been cool to see ARM SoCs with Nvidia IP. I was/am one of the few people on Reddit who actually liked the deal. The vast majority of people were in the camp of ""zomg Nvidia closed source monopoly price fixing omg"". Reddit hive mind is real. Anyways, I'm bullish on custom ARM designs long-term. I'm bearish on ARM the company because their stock cores can't compete with high-end custom ARM cores and high-end x86 cores. If their stock cores can't outperform custom cores, then they will be reduced to small licensing fees forever. This doesn't justify their $40b+ valuation. Every big player in the mobile space is making tens or hundreds of billions. Somehow the tech that is crucial to the mobile world is making peanuts. This isn't going to change and might get worse. ARM is essential but not a cash cow and has no potential to be a cash cow. There is no doubt that Softbank saw the same thing and wanted to unload ARM. First, by trying to sell it to a company who valued its technology more than its financials. Now by trying to IPO. Buyers beware.","Unless there's are ways to increase licensing fees with strong margin, I really doubt ARM as a public company will have much appeal.Given past history how Apple fought Qualcomm on licensing fees of patent, there are little headroom for ARM to squeeze guys like Apple on increase licensing fees.End of day they should be treated like a supplier to Apple and other companies using ARM in terms of valuation.",0,0.548,1.0,NEGATIVE

Stock ARM chips are used by companies like Qualcomm, Mediatek, etc. But slowly, these companies are moving away from them and they're designing their own ARM-based chips. This means ARM will make less money from them and they too, will become both customers and competitors to ARM. ARM's biggest customers are an existential threat to ARM's most profitable business. I'm not buying. While I believe that ARM CPUs will continue to take marketshare away from x86 on laptops, desktops, and servers, I don't believe the company will be that profitable. Despite licensing its IP and being at the core of the mobile world, ARM's business model makes peanuts compared to Apple, Qualcomm, AMD, Intel, Nvidia. ARM's last reported revenue was $2b/year. Apple makes that in 1.5 days. Microsoft makes 88x more. Intel makes 39x more. Qualcomm makes 17x more. In essence, ARM can't compete with the big boys and far more profitable companies are poaching their talent. Take for example, Mike Filippo, a lead architect at ARM, was poached by Apple then poached by Microsoft. ARM simply can't compete with the money that big tech can throw at their top employees. If you're a top student graduate, you're going to Apple/Intel/AMD/Nvidia. You're not going to ARM Austin Texas. Whenever a big tech company wants to build a custom ARM chip, they go raid ARM talent. This basically means ARM won't be able to match the performance of big tech designs with their stock ARM cores. And it shows because Apple Silicon is far ahead of stock ARM cores, Qualcomm themselves will be building custom ARM cores again, and Ampere is ditching stock ARM cores for their own custom server cores. Companies that only rely on the ARM ISA pay far less in licensing fees than companies that also license ARM core designs. Nvidia buying ARM would have injected the capital needed to compete with Apple, Qualcomm, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, AMD, Intel designs and future designs. And it would have been cool to see ARM SoCs with Nvidia IP. I was/am one of the few people on Reddit who actually liked the deal. The vast majority of people were in the camp of ""zomg Nvidia closed source monopoly price fixing omg"". Reddit hive mind is real. Anyways, I'm bullish on custom ARM designs long-term. I'm bearish on ARM the company because their stock cores can't compete with high-end custom ARM cores and high-end x86 cores. If their stock cores can't outperform custom cores, then they will be reduced to small licensing fees forever. This doesn't justify their $40b+ valuation. Every big player in the mobile space is making tens or hundreds of billions. Somehow the tech that is crucial to the mobile world is making peanuts. This isn't going to change and might get worse.

This means ARM will make less money from them and they too, will become both customers and competitors to ARM. ARM's biggest customers are an existential threat to ARM's most profitable business. I'm not buying. While I believe that ARM CPUs will continue to take marketshare away from x86 on laptops, desktops, and servers, I don't believe the company will be that profitable.

Apple makes that in 1.5 days. Microsoft makes 88x more. Intel makes 39x more. Qualcomm makes 17x more. In essence, ARM can't compete with the big boys and far more profitable companies are poaching their talent. Take for example, Mike Filippo, a lead architect at ARM, was poached by Apple then poached by Microsoft. ARM simply can't compete with the money that big tech can throw at their top employees. If you're a top student graduate, you're going to Apple/Intel/AMD/Nvidia. You're not going to ARM Austin Texas. Whenever a big tech company wants to build a custom ARM chip, they go raid ARM talent. This basically means ARM won't be able to match the performance of big tech designs with their stock ARM cores. And it shows because Apple Silicon is far ahead of stock ARM cores, Qualcomm themselves will be building custom ARM cores again, and Ampere is ditching stock ARM cores for their own custom server cores. Companies that only rely on the ARM ISA pay far less in licensing fees than companies that also license ARM core designs. Nvidia buying ARM would have injected the capital needed to compete with Apple, Qualcomm, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, AMD, Intel designs and future designs. And it would have been cool to see ARM SoCs with Nvidia IP. I was/am one of the few people on Reddit who actually liked the deal. The vast majority of people were in the camp of ""zomg Nvidia closed source monopoly price fixing omg"". Reddit hive mind is real. Anyways, I'm bullish on custom ARM designs long-term. I'm bearish on ARM the company because their stock cores can't compete with high-end custom ARM cores and high-end x86 cores. If their stock cores can't outperform custom cores, then they will be reduced to small licensing fees forever. This doesn't justify their $40b+ valuation. Every big player in the mobile space is making tens or hundreds of billions. Somehow the tech that is crucial to the mobile world is making peanuts. This isn't going to change and might get worse.

Stock ARM chips are used by companies like Qualcomm, Mediatek, etc. But slowly, these companies are moving away from them and they're designing their own ARM-based chips. This means ARM will make less money from them and they too, will become both customers and competitors to ARM. ARM's biggest customers are an existential threat to ARM's most profitable business. I'm not buying. While I believe that ARM CPUs will continue to take marketshare away from x86 on laptops, desktops, and servers, I don't believe the company will be that profitable.

In essence, ARM can't compete with the big boys and far more profitable companies are poaching their talent.

If you're a top student graduate, you're going to Apple/Intel/AMD/Nvidia. You're not going to ARM Austin Texas. Whenever a big tech company wants to build a custom ARM chip, they go raid ARM talent. This basically means ARM won't be able to match the performance of big tech designs with their stock ARM cores. And it shows because Apple Silicon is far ahead of stock ARM cores, Qualcomm themselves will be building custom ARM cores again, and Ampere is ditching stock ARM cores for their own custom server cores. Companies that only rely on the ARM ISA pay far less in licensing fees than companies that also license ARM core designs. Nvidia buying ARM would have injected the capital needed to compete with Apple, Qualcomm, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, AMD, Intel designs and future designs. And it would have been cool to see ARM SoCs with Nvidia IP. I was/am one of the few people on Reddit who actually liked the deal.

I'm bearish on ARM the company because their stock cores can't compete with high-end custom ARM cores and high-end x86 cores. If their stock cores can't outperform custom cores, then they will be reduced to small licensing fees forever. This doesn't justify their $40b+ valuation. Every big player in the mobile space is making tens or hundreds of billions. Somehow the tech that is crucial to the mobile world is making peanuts. This isn't going to change and might get worse.

I'll take a crack at this.....There is an ARM ISA (Instruction set architecture). Companies like Apple license the ISA and design their own custom cores (read: custom apple cores are not modified arm cores). Licensing ISA is cheaper, meaning not so good for ARM.ARM designs it own cores (aka stock arm cores) and companies like Qualcomm, Samsung, Mediatek license these cores to use in their processors. Licensing these cores is relatively expensive, meaning better for ARM.Now, Apple custom cores have been outperforming the stock arm cores (by 10%, if I had to quote a number) for quite a while now....So other companies like amazon, microsoft, Ampere, Qualcomm are trying to design their own cores. (They have to take ARM ISA license which is cheaper than licensing the ARM stock cores).So, for ARM licensing their stock cores to maximum partners is most beneficial....but since arm stock cores are not able to effectively compete against custom cores. ARM ends up earning less.Thats why Qualcomm (which is a partner, i.e. licenses the stock arm cores) has a team developing custom cores (so in the future they will only license the ARM ISA).Therefore Qualcomm's custom cores will be effecting competing with arm stock cores.I hope this write-up gives you clarity on this matter.",3,0.535,1.0,NEGATIVE

This is why your iPhone is always faster than Android phones. Yes, Apple is both a customer and a competitor to ARM. Stock ARM chips are used by companies like Qualcomm, Mediatek, etc. But slowly, these companies are moving away from them and they're designing their own ARM-based chips. This means ARM will make less money from them and they too, will become both customers and competitors to ARM. ARM's biggest customers are an existential threat to ARM's most profitable business. I'm not buying. While I believe that ARM CPUs will continue to take marketshare away from x86 on laptops, desktops, and servers, I don't believe the company will be that profitable. Despite licensing its IP and being at the core of the mobile world, ARM's business model makes peanuts compared to Apple, Qualcomm, AMD, Intel, Nvidia. ARM's last reported revenue was $2b/year. Apple makes that in 1.5 days. Microsoft makes 88x more. Intel makes 39x more. Qualcomm makes 17x more. In essence, ARM can't compete with the big boys and far more profitable companies are poaching their talent. Take for example, Mike Filippo, a lead architect at ARM, was poached by Apple then poached by Microsoft. ARM simply can't compete with the money that big tech can throw at their top employees. If you're a top student graduate, you're going to Apple/Intel/AMD/Nvidia. You're not going to ARM Austin Texas. Whenever a big tech company wants to build a custom ARM chip, they go raid ARM talent. This basically means ARM won't be able to match the performance of big tech designs with their stock ARM cores. And it shows because Apple Silicon is far ahead of stock ARM cores, Qualcomm themselves will be building custom ARM cores again, and Ampere is ditching stock ARM cores for their own custom server cores. Companies that only rely on the ARM ISA pay far less in licensing fees than companies that also license ARM core designs. Nvidia buying ARM would have injected the capital needed to compete with Apple, Qualcomm, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, AMD, Intel designs and future designs.

,"Edit: People are very confused about how ARM licensing works. Read this explanation first: ARM licenses its ISA and/or stock CPU designs to companies. Some companies license both. They pay more. Some companies only license the ISA. They pay less. Apple only licenses the ISA, for example. Apple's ARM-based designs actually compete with ARM's stock designs. This is why your iPhone is always faster than Android phones. Yes, Apple is both a customer and a competitor to ARM. Stock ARM chips are used by companies like Qualcomm, Mediatek, etc. But slowly, these companies are moving away from them and they're designing their own ARM-based chips. This means ARM will make less money from them and they too, will become both customers and competitors to ARM. ARM's biggest customers are an existential threat to ARM's most profitable business. I'm not buying. While I believe that ARM CPUs will continue to take marketshare away from x86 on laptops, desktops, and servers, I don't believe the company will be that profitable. Despite licensing its IP and being at the core of the mobile world, ARM's business model makes peanuts compared to Apple, Qualcomm, AMD, Intel, Nvidia. ARM's last reported revenue was $2b/year. Apple makes that in 1.5 days. Microsoft makes 88x more. Intel makes 39x more. Qualcomm makes 17x more. In essence, ARM can't compete with the big boys and far more profitable companies are poaching their talent. Take for example, Mike Filippo, a lead architect at ARM, was poached by Apple then poached by Microsoft. ARM simply can't compete with the money that big tech can throw at their top employees. If you're a top student graduate, you're going to Apple/Intel/AMD/Nvidia. You're not going to ARM Austin Texas. Whenever a big tech company wants to build a custom ARM chip, they go raid ARM talent. This basically means ARM won't be able to match the performance of big tech designs with their stock ARM cores. And it shows because Apple Silicon is far ahead of stock ARM cores, Qualcomm themselves will be building custom ARM cores again, and Ampere is ditching stock ARM cores for their own custom server cores. Companies that only rely on the ARM ISA pay far less in licensing fees than companies that also license ARM core designs. Nvidia buying ARM would have injected the capital needed to compete with Apple, Qualcomm, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, AMD, Intel designs and future designs. And it would have been cool to see ARM SoCs with Nvidia IP. I was/am one of the few people on Reddit who actually liked the deal. The vast majority of people were in the camp of ""zomg Nvidia closed source monopoly price fixing omg"". Reddit hive mind is real. Anyways, I'm bullish on custom ARM designs long-term. I'm bearish on ARM the company because their stock cores can't compete with high-end custom ARM cores and high-end x86 cores. If their stock cores can't outperform custom cores, then they will be reduced to small licensing fees forever. This doesn't justify their $40b+ valuation. Every big player in the mobile space is making tens or hundreds of billions. Somehow the tech that is crucial to the mobile world is making peanuts. This isn't going to change and might get worse. ARM is essential but not a cash cow and has no potential to be a cash cow. There is no doubt that Softbank saw the same thing and wanted to unload ARM. First, by trying to sell it to a company who valued its technology more than its financials. Now by trying to IPO.

This means ARM will make less money from them and they too, will become both customers and competitors to ARM. ARM's biggest customers are an existential threat to ARM's most profitable business. I'm not buying. While I believe that ARM CPUs will continue to take marketshare away from x86 on laptops, desktops, and servers, I don't believe the company will be that profitable. Despite licensing its IP and being at the core of the mobile world, ARM's business model makes peanuts compared to Apple, Qualcomm, AMD, Intel, Nvidia. ARM's last reported revenue was $2b/year. Apple makes that in 1.5 days. Microsoft makes 88x more. Intel makes 39x more. Qualcomm makes 17x more. In essence, ARM can't compete with the big boys and far more profitable companies are poaching their talent. Take for example, Mike Filippo, a lead architect at ARM, was poached by Apple then poached by Microsoft. ARM simply can't compete with the money that big tech can throw at their top employees. If you're a top student graduate, you're going to Apple/Intel/AMD/Nvidia. You're not going to ARM Austin Texas. Whenever a big tech company wants to build a custom ARM chip, they go raid ARM talent. This basically means ARM won't be able to match the performance of big tech designs with their stock ARM cores. And it shows because Apple Silicon is far ahead of stock ARM cores, Qualcomm themselves will be building custom ARM cores again, and Ampere is ditching stock ARM cores for their own custom server cores. Companies that only rely on the ARM ISA pay far less in licensing fees than companies that also license ARM core designs. Nvidia buying ARM would have injected the capital needed to compete with Apple, Qualcomm, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, AMD, Intel designs and future designs. And it would have been cool to see ARM SoCs with Nvidia IP. I was/am one of the few people on Reddit who actually liked the deal. The vast majority of people were in the camp of ""zomg Nvidia closed source monopoly price fixing omg"". Reddit hive mind is real. Anyways, I'm bullish on custom ARM designs long-term. I'm bearish on ARM the company because their stock cores can't compete with high-end custom ARM cores and high-end x86 cores. If their stock cores can't outperform custom cores, then they will be reduced to small licensing fees forever. This doesn't justify their $40b+ valuation. Every big player in the mobile space is making tens or hundreds of billions. Somehow the tech that is crucial to the mobile world is making peanuts. This isn't going to change and might get worse. ARM is essential but not a cash cow and has no potential to be a cash cow. There is no doubt that Softbank saw the same thing and wanted to unload ARM. First, by trying to sell it to a company who valued its technology more than its financials. Now by trying to IPO. Buyers beware.","Yes, if AWS, Azure, Google Cloud keep using stock ARM cores.But ask yourself. You think these giant tech companies will all use the same cores and have the same cloud performance? No. One or all of them will start building custom ARM cores to increase their competitiveness.The cloud business will depend on who can build the best server chip.",1,0.557,0.999,NEGATIVE
