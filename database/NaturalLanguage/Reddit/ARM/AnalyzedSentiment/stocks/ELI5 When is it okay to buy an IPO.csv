What goes into your decision and when do you decide it is a good time to enter a position?","When people say don't buy at IPO price, they generally mean don't buy the company in the short-term as soon as you are able to. What happens is you have illogical buyers who don't know how to assess the company which leads to price volatility. Wait until a few earnings quarters and then you can decide for yourself if the company makes sense. When a company is private, very few people outside of institutional investors know about the company and their financials. When they are public, everyone has access to the info and thus, you have more qualified opinions.Your Meta example proves my point. A few months after IPO'ing, the stock dropped 50%. But in the long run, as more earnings were released, people realized that the company is growing and becoming profitable which in turn, has led to the price it is today. The point is simply let others deal with the volatility in the IPO stages and buy the company when there is an opportunity at a lower price if the investment makes sense.Another thing to watch out for is when they choose to IPO. Roblox closed the first day of trading at $70. It's worth $28 today. When they IPO'd, the stock market was heavily inflated. Today, if they tried to IPO, they wouldn't sniff anywhere close to $70. Timing matters. That's why the best way to take timing and uncertainty out of the equation is by waiting until the dust settles.",2,0.578,0.998,NEGATIVE
