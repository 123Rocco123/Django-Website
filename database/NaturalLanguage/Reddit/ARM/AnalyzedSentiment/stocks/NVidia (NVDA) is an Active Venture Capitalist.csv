Invest in AI startups so they have enough money to buy your overpriced products with >90% margins, your products show up with their full value on their balance sheet as property, plant, and equipment, and their shares show up on your balance sheet at their inflated valuation. As a result, a $1 Billion investment results in $1 Billion profit without anything of value being created(unless you seriously think these AI startups are worth what Nvidia is paying for them).I don't understand how Wall Street is dumb enough to not see through this.",0,0.546,NEGATIVE,1.0

There was another Redditor who raised concerns about impropriety and conflict of interest because NVidia doesn't have a separate, independent but wholly owned subsidiary to handle their investments. That is how other companies like MSFT, GOOGL, AAPL, INTC, AMZN handle their investments, and NVDA should do better by following in their footsteps and create a separate wholly owned independent venture capital subsidiary with its own website so we can easily access information about their portfolio companies and not have to actively hunt for that info.",1,0.529,NEGATIVE,1.0
