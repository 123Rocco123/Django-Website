,"I kinda regret selling this stock early on when the price was stagnating. Recently it just shot to the moon. And according to some analysts, the price is said to go up further. Now I dont know much about the company aside from it being a contender in the AI space. How do they hold up to competitors and what makes them special exactly?","As far as I know, ARM’s only competition is RISC-V and x86, RISC-V being the bigger threat since reduced instruction set architectures (ARM and RISC-V) are gradually displacing x86. Despite this, ARM is the frontrunner in the CPU architecture market, and I don’t think big tech companies would be investing heavily into ARM if they didn’t think ARM would play a big role in the future of computing.The stock looks very expensive however. IMO there is not enough data to conclude how much profit and growth they can achieve consistently to be able to properly value the business. Qualitatively, I like the business model. Quantitatively, I would need more tangible earnings to determine if they can provide a good ROIC.",0,0.541,NEGATIVE,0.991

There are other risks to consider such as the unreliable income stream from ARM China being a huge percentage of their earnings. The business model is good; all they do is design CPU architectures and collect licensing fees and royalties from it. However, at the current price I am not interested.",2,0.541,NEGATIVE,1.0

Now I dont know much about the company aside from it being a contender in the AI space. How do they hold up to competitors and what makes them special exactly?",Kinda depends. At the moment they don’t have any real competition so they can make a considerable amount of money. And the market they are in is growing at a fast rate. If they just paid out a nice dividend then they would be valued as such which would be well below their current market cap.They are not doing that. Right now they are committing heavy to r&d. Quick search showed 42% of revenue went to r&d up from the year prior. they will be able to continue this spending and revenue will continue to increase as long as no new competitor comes but if one does then they spent billions of dollars on r&d with no returns when that money could’ve been in the shareholders profit.,2,0.557,NEGATIVE,1.0

How do they hold up to competitors and what makes them special exactly?","ARM is going to be very successful going forward. However the IPO seems to have primarily been focused on generating revenue for Soft Bank after a series of massive investment failures, which makes me distrustful of the stock. I haven't watched it's price much since the IPO, I was never going to touch that. If it's way down since then, it may be worth picking up.Edit: there's also a limit to what ARM can do. It licenses its instruction set, which means it generates royalties from chip sales. However, there's only so much of a royalty it can collect. With RISC-V out there, if they push the licensing price up too much competitors will adopt RISC-V instead.So basically I think they will be a big player, a profitable player, with lots of room for growth, but there is probably a limit on the amount of revenue they can ultimately generate.",0,0.536,NEGATIVE,1.0

The reality is I obviously wasn’t expecting it to do this because it was going to be a long term position. I have been looking at what the market is doing and at the very least it could get as high as AMD at the moment, if that’s a good buy for you I’d say do it.

Compared to other uses for this class of hardware, the computing power needed for AI is exponential. So, as more and more GPUs and CPUs are needed to compute more data quickly, guess what? Your energy needs (and bills) go UP.Super Micro Computer (hardware) and ARM holdings (design licensing) are two industry leaders who recognized that power efficiency was going to be key to market growth. They incorporated energy efficiency in their designs - SMCI being among the first to focus on this. They're ahead of their competitors this way. That's why both have broken out.And I think they will continue to grow quickly, as more analysts (and the public) figure this out.Just be prepared for volatility along the way, as buyers sway between euphoria and panic as the price changes.",0,0.532,POSITIVE,0.999
