,"Swedish arms manufacturer SAAB is a forgotten gem among European defense stocks. Like all other defense stocks, SAAB gained a lot in the beginning of the Ukraine war and is now trading at around P/E 30 which is historically high and not that impressive. What makes the stock interesting now is how many orders have been coming in lately and how the price of the stock hasn't skyrocketed further in response, yet at least. Relative to other arms manufacturers, SAAB is not that large and their potential market cap is enormous. I initially bought a small position in SAAB because I was impressed with the fighter jet Gripen and figured that given the quite small current market cap it just takes 1-3 countries to adopt the Gripen system to massively increase the revenue for SAAB. Nowadays the orders just keep coming in, and the stock price is not really keeping up, so I've bought more shares. Colombia just decided to buy Gripen and Brazil is going to expand their fleet. Apart from Gripen, which is of course the crown jewel of SAABs products they also make the NLAW anti tank missile, AT4 anti tank missiles, radar systems, top tier camouflage fabrics and a lot of other high tech defense related products. Products | Saab They are also designing their first drone at the moment. This is a really well run company, with a long history of building weapons, they are relatively small compared to other major players in the industry and just offers a very impressive range of products. I can't see this stock not being a good pick.","SAAB's Q3 numbers are insane. Order backlog hit SEK190 billion - up 37% YoY. Their organic growth is at 17.5% and EBIT margins improved from 7.5% to 8.8%.That DoJ investigation into the Brazil Gripen deal isn't great news, but both Brazilian and Swedish authorities already cleared them. Plus the original deal was from 2014. Old news.They're expanding production capacity big time - new facilities in India and Michigan. Smart move with all these orders flowing in. The Gripen's picking up steam internationally and their anti-tank weapons are basically printing money since Ukraine.Their P/E of 30 looks high historically but makes sense given their growth trajectory and massive backlog. Defense spending's not slowing down anytime soon. This is a solid long-term play in the defense sector.",0,0.533,NEGATIVE,0.968

Their Carl Gustaf anti-tank weapons are in huge demand (Ukraine effect), and India's been a major buyer. The Michigan and India expansions are about meeting that massive order backlog across their whole portfolio.India did pick Rafale over Gripen for their fighter program, but that's ancient history now. SAAB's killing it in other markets - look at their 40% jump in order intake this quarter alone. Their weapons, radar systems, and electronic warfare stuff are what's driving growth right now.The smart play here is looking at SAAB as a full-spectrum defense company, not just an aircraft manufacturer. Those EBIT margins and that SEK190B backlog tell the real story. Defense spending's through the roof globally, and SAAB's positioned perfectly to capitalize on it.",2,0.531,POSITIVE,0.762

I initially bought a small position in SAAB because I was impressed with the fighter jet Gripen and figured that given the quite small current market cap it just takes 1-3 countries to adopt the Gripen system to massively increase the revenue for SAAB. Nowadays the orders just keep coming in, and the stock price is not really keeping up, so I've bought more shares. Colombia just decided to buy Gripen and Brazil is going to expand their fleet. Apart from Gripen, which is of course the crown jewel of SAABs products they also make the NLAW anti tank missile, AT4 anti tank missiles, radar systems, top tier camouflage fabrics and a lot of other high tech defense related products. Products | Saab They are also designing their first drone at the moment. This is a really well run company, with a long history of building weapons, they are relatively small compared to other major players in the industry and just offers a very impressive range of products. I can't see this stock not being a good pick.","The problem is th f-35 is cheaper and far far more capable and survivable. So the largest potential for new customers is largely gone, that leaves countries the US won't sell the f35 to, but iirc the gripen is also subject to us veto over international sales.",0,0.569,NEGATIVE,0.996
,"Swedish arms manufacturer SAAB is a forgotten gem among European defense stocks. Like all other defense stocks, SAAB gained a lot in the beginning of the Ukraine war and is now trading at around P/E 30 which is historically high and not that impressive. What makes the stock interesting now is how many orders have been coming in lately and how the price of the stock hasn't skyrocketed further in response, yet at least. Relative to other arms manufacturers, SAAB is not that large and their potential market cap is enormous.

Gripen is way cheaper to run and can land and start from ordinary highways with no problems at all. Gripen is a way older design though, they are slightly worse than the modern f-35 but still a great plane to buy. Ukraine keeps asking for them over f-16s too.",1,0.513,POSITIVE,1.0

Gen 4 planes can only fight gen 5 planes by using attrition.There's a reason countries are buying hundreds of gen 5 planes(include the wests adversaries).
