,"Hi! I am an ex-prop trader that trades equities. This is a daily watchlist for trading. I might trade all of the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that don't appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell. Many stocks I post are <$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade. If you have questions to ask, PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like “Thoughts on ____?” will be ignored. News: US Retail Sales Top Forecasts as Consumers Keep Fueling Growth TSLA- Broke the 160 level after the 10% workforce layoff news yesterday and production halt of Cybertrucks, worth watching further. ITCI- Phase 3 results are showing statistically meaningful results in both primary/secondary endpoints. MS- Reports Q1 2.02 vs 1.69 expected earnings. Revenue is $15.1B vs $14.5B. Good earnings like GS, buoyed by IB/trading arm gains. DJT- Likely going to move with news from the court case it develops- most interesting thing I’m watching today. BAC- Beats earnings and revenue expectations (0.83 vs .77e, revenue is 25.8 v 25.3B). However, states that Q2 (this one) will be the lowest quarter they have this year.
