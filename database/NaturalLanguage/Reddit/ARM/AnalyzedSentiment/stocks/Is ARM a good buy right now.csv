,Just curious on everyone's thoughts about it. I'm not an expert by any means but looking at past trends ARM seems to be pretty volatile but has ups and downs in respect with NVDA and the AI industry in general.,ARM is highly manipulated by softbank. I believe softbank owns 90% of the stock and only a very small number of share are available. It is extremely overpriced. Their margins are terrible and their growth is capped.,1,0.551,NEGATIVE,1.0
,Just curious on everyone's thoughts about it. I'm not an expert by any means but looking at past trends ARM seems to be pretty volatile but has ups and downs in respect with NVDA and the AI industry in general.,I don’t know if it is intentionally manipulated by SoftBank.

,Just curious on everyone's thoughts about it. I'm not an expert by any means but looking at past trends ARM seems to be pretty volatile but has ups and downs in respect with NVDA and the AI industry in general.,"When does valuations ever make sense in stock?! Alot of companies don't make sense and people still buy. Just buy what you like and/or if you have strong conviction in them. I've been buying ARM and AVGO for the long haul. Technology isn't going anywhere unless ""electricity/power"" (i.e the pickets/axes/shovels) goes out and turns us back to the stone age. ARM will continue to have the ROYALTIES that these big players (i.e. APPLE, BROADCOM, NVIDIA, INTEL, AMD, ETC) have used from ARM'S chip designs. ARM doesn't just have association with AI but other devices such as mobile phones, car cpu chips, etc. Too bad, NVDIA couldn't buy out ARM a couple years ago, otherwise NVDIA and ARM would have the industry by its nuts by now.",0,0.549,NEGATIVE,0.994

,Just curious on everyone's thoughts about it. I'm not an expert by any means but looking at past trends ARM seems to be pretty volatile but has ups and downs in respect with NVDA and the AI industry in general.,"ARM had ~$2b in revenue in 2021. In 2024 they had $3.something b. In 3 years, when their sector is supposed to be on fire, they couldn't even double revenue on a low number.NVDA went from $25b/yr revenue to going on near $100b/year. That is why the stock exploded.I would agree that ARM has many potential avenues for longer term growth. But the valuation on the stock today assumes they have accomplished half or more of that success already. Same with AMD. The people who missed out on NVDA are being convinced to try their luck on the next big one as ARM and/or AMD.With both ARM and AMD you have huge downside risk - that doesn't mean they are bad companies or have bad products - it's simply the valuation is a poor risk/reward proposition.",1,0.561,NEGATIVE,1.0

I'm not an expert by any means but looking at past trends ARM seems to be pretty volatile but has ups and downs in respect with NVDA and the AI industry in general.,"Consider both, eventually.. diversified trading or going long spreads risk out, and remember the QQQ's are tech heavy, those can trade poorly while SPY can lift for other factors due to how stocks are weighed, like Boeing, Energy and Pharma.If you're looking to go long might be best to wait to buy anything until early Oct, market has a lot of wood to chop. Should hit a bottom then need to retest. Could see minor rallies along the way but don't be fooled they'll sell off just as fast.",6,0.525,NEGATIVE,0.999
