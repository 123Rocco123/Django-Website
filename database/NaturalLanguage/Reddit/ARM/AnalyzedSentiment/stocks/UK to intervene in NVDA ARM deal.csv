(there are already 2 or 3 companies which try out RISC-V and it seems ARM will have a hard time against it, especially in low power devices)ARM is only so successful, because they don't produce hardware themself and are independent.",1,0.53,1.0,NEGATIVE

I agree that the wording was a bit silly but also fairly common parlance. But your point isn’t correct - just because you can’t say one thing doesn’t mean you can say the opposite.For example, if I say “I can’t say she left the house today,” that doesn’t mean it’s true that “I can say she did leave the house today.” Maybe I just have no idea whether she did or not.",4,0.512,0.992,NEGATIVE

The ISA is akin to the language the CPU will interpret. ARM also produces reference designs for CPU cores that interpret this language. Most of the ARM CPUs from various companies that make ARM CPUs use these reference cores. Apple is different in that it designs its own cores to interpret the instruction set. This is one of the reasons Apple CPUs are so much faster than other ARM chips. Apple is also different in that it was one of the founders of ARM Holdings, and reputedly it works very closely with ARM on new versions of the ISA.RISC-V is an alternative ISA to ARM. It is an attempt for industry to come together and create an open standard that is not controlled by any one company.Put yourself in Apple's place. Suppose you want to open up a new source of revenue by selling your Mx ARM chips in the server market. The M1 is fast and low power. It might make a great CPU for a dense server farm. Even as you contemplate selling CPUs to the server market you see that Nvidia will be a competitor. Every chip you sell helps Nvidia because you have to pay ARM, which is now owned by Nvidia. You will be motivated to give more support to RISC-V, looking to eventually cut out ARM altogether. In the place of Apple, you could place AMD, Qualcomm, Samsung, etc. Those other companies are more vulnerable than Apple because they use ARM's core designs.",2,0.544,0.956,POSITIVE
