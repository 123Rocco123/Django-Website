,"https://tokenist.com/apple-nvidia-intel-and-others-interested-in-arms-upcoming-blockbuster-ipo/ September initial public offering (IPO) on the Nasdaq, after receiving approvals from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Nasdaq. The anticipated $60 billion valuation will make it the largest IPO of 2023. Leading tech giants such as Nvidia, Intel, Samsung, and Apple are keen to acquire a few percent stake each in Arm, aiming for medium to long-term shareholder roles to ensure stock price stability at listing. Since the abandonment of a $40 billion sale to Nvidia in 2020 due to regulatory concerns, SoftBank has been working on taking Arm public. The chipmaker's market valuation has doubled from the $31 billion SoftBank paid seven years ago. This significant IPO follows Technicolor's $97 billion deal in September 2022, marking a major milestone in the technology and finance sectors. Arm's IPO stands as a pivotal event in the global semiconductor market, reflecting the company's critical role in the industry. Along with the imminent listing, other major financial moves are underway in the tech world, such as Alibaba's contemplation of a $29 billion listing of its IDCG e-commerce unit in the US, showcasing a dynamic and robust market landscape.","ARM's IPO could backfire. A lot of people are concerned that ARM will increase licensing fees, there are some rumors they will be doubled. Qualcomm, Google, and a number of other vendors are taking a more serious look at RISC-V which is an open processor with no fees. If ARM gets too greedy they will bleed market share. Companies like Apple don't need much from ARM and there is no point paying high fees for an instruction set which can be swapped for something free.",0,0.528,1.0,NEGATIVE

The reason for that is the foundation of ARM's success is on the ridiculously low power draw their designs can achieve. This is unique and it's what started the entire company.Yes, people can use RISC-V to have design and manufacture in house but they won't be able to get the same low power draw without infringing on ARM designs. RISC-V is fantastic for new chip designers and probably will take over as the main platform and enable innovation but companies that rely on guaranteed performance, and consistency with the chips they are manufacturing are not going to move away from ARM designs for a long time. Even then they will all want to sit back and watch as the first company tries someone else's designs while they are safe.",1,0.542,0.999,POSITIVE

ARM would be countered sued. A cross patent agreement would happen as it normally does. Even if that didn't happen ARM may be forced to grant patents by third parties. Back in the 80s IBM forced Intel to license x86 patents to AMD.ARM's success is on the ridiculously low power draw their designs can achieveARM is a RISC processor the fact that ARM is low power is a side effect of that and their original development. Low power isn't the only market for compute. Performance computing doesn't care about power. AI/ML work loads are GPU intense and don't need the fastest processor either.,2,0.536,1.0,NEGATIVE
