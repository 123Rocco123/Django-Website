,"I looking to put some money into SemiC sector, but I am having trouble deciding which companies I should go for. I did some analysis for long term investments, and from what I see NVDA, AMD, ASML and AMAT is the way to go. The only thing I am having trouble understanding if high P/E is indicating that stocks are overvalued or that is just very high from recent growth. If i took into account high P/E, that would indicate that AMD and AMAT is the best potential for long growth, while NVDA and ASML should slow down quite a lot. Also I heard about NVDA ARM deal, which if it should go down soon, that would bone AMD quite bad, and AMD is merging XLNX which should impact AMD quite well by the end of the year.

On the other hand, the yield of Intel’s foundries is another big question. Although I am a big fan of Gelsinger, I don’t want to put money in Intel now.Have to keep in mind that having the money to build foundries is one thing, having the capability is another.

There are lots of different types as ""semiconductor"" is a bit broad. For example, you mentioned ASML. ASML doesnt produce semiconductors, they produce semiconductor equipment needed to make chips. Their business is actually really interesting. They only sell a handful of machines a year, but they cost 9 figures each. That's because they are extremely difficult to make and everyone wants one.Conversely, Nividia is one of the best names in the business. Great technology, serves a lot of different industries like gaming, auto, and AI. They have a long price, but a lot is priced into the name.So, a lot of people recommend just buying the ETF and I think that is sound advice. The industry is all over the place where demand/supply are changing very often. So if you can stomach the craziness, buy chip companies. If you're someone like me that would rather buy the companies supplying the pick axes and shovels instead of looking for gold... then buy companies like ASML.

You could have them scale percentage wise, where one company is still getting a higher percentage and then it scales down to the 5th company having the smallest position.We all remember the saying... ""Don't put all your eggs in one basket"". It makes a ton of sense. What if there was some sort of calamity or tragedy with that particular company? Some sort of horrible lawsuit or scandal.Now, of course, if you have 90 percent of your money in a single play, and it does really, really, really well, then you feel like you're getting over on all the ""safe"" people with their diversified portfolios.

,"I looking to put some money into SemiC sector, but I am having trouble deciding which companies I should go for. I did some analysis for long term investments, and from what I see NVDA, AMD, ASML and AMAT is the way to go. The only thing I am having trouble understanding if high P/E is indicating that stocks are overvalued or that is just very high from recent growth. If i took into account high P/E, that would indicate that AMD and AMAT is the best potential for long growth, while NVDA and ASML should slow down quite a lot.

They're both gonna keep growing as long as the world continue to need more and more chips.However I also think ASML seems like a pretty solid choice. They basically have a monopoly when it comes to making the high end chip making machines if I understand the situation correctly. Considering the difficulty of that product category, I don't see much chance that they start facing serious competition any time soon, and they're also just gonna keep growing as the world continues to need more and better chips",0,0.54,0.998,POSITIVE
