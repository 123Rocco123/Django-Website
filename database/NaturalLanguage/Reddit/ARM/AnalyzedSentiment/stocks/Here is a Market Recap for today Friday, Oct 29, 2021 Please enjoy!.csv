,"PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, October 29, 2021 The remarkable rally in equities continued, with stocks jumping despite two of the largest companies, Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN), posting disappointing earnings results in an otherwise solid earnings season. The S&P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) both closed the week at record closing levels. Coming into Q3 earnings season, market participants were worried the persistent supply-chain disruptions and labor market imbalances would hamper corporate profits, so it is very encouraging to see companies holding up better than expected. Recent economic data has also contributed to the bounce in equities. After suffering its first -5% dip in September, the SPY has come back with a vengeance, advancing more than 7% from the October 4 bottom. In this same time period, the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped a staggering 10% and the Dow Jones (DIA) gained 5%. Not to toot my own horn too much, but I publicly remained bullish during September volatility and consistently encouraged dip-buying via this recap. Happy to say the strategy, as it has all year, worked great and personally resulted in my most profitable month all year. Hope some of y'all took advantage. Never try to fight market trends, much easier to ride them until you can’t anymore. As I have said for like six months at this point, I think the trend will change once the Fed begins discussing interest rate hikes. When that happens, I’ll reassess my position. Until then I see any and all dips as buying opportunities. Amazon (AMZN) shares dropped after the e-commerce juggernaut missed third-quarter expectations and forecasted a jump in expenses in the fourth quarter due to supply chain disruptions and rising costs for labor, materials and freight. These factors are expected to generate ""several billion dollars of additional costs"" to Amazon in the current quarter, the company said in its earnings statement. Here are the numbers: Earnings: $6.12 vs $8.92 per share expected Revenue: $110.81 billion vs $111.6 billion expected Q4 Guidance: Amazon forecast sales between $130 billion and $140 billion Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Prime Subs: $55.9 billion Net product sales: $54.9 billion Apple (AAPL) also disappointed Wall Street in its fiscal first-quarter results, with key iPhone sales missing expectations, with the launch of the iPhone 13 hampered by the global shortage in semiconductors that forced Apple to massively cut down on production, new rules that allow third-party payment systems in the App store, and supply chain issues, which Tim Cook says cost the company more than $6 billion. Key Apple suppliers like Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Qualcomm (QCOM) fell on the miss. Here are the numbers: EPS: $1.24 vs. $1.24 estimated Revenue: $83.36 billion vs. $84.85 billion estimated, up 29% year-over-year iPhone revenue: $38.87 billion vs. $41.51 billion estimated, up 47% year-over-year Services revenue: $18.28 billion vs. $17.64 billion estimated, up 25.6% year-over-year Other Products revenue: $8.79 billion vs. $9.33 billion estimated, up 11.5% year-over-year Mac revenue: $9.18 billion vs. $9.23 billion estimated, up 1.6% year-over-year iPad revenue: $8.25 billion vs. $7.23 billion estimated, up 21.4% year-over-year Earlier in the week, a report showed US GDP decelerated to expand at the slowest rate in over one year for the July through September quarter, with the Delta variant and supply-side constraints capping economic activity. GDP rose at a 2.0% annualized rate, missing estimates for the 2.6% pace consensus economists anticipated. However, despite this report and other recent tepid economic data, market participants have remained remarkably resilient and kept buying up any dips. Highlights Facebook (FB) announced it will be rebranding under new name “Meta” and the ticker will change to MVRS starting December 1. This is to reflect the company’s emphasis into investing in the metaverse, a 3D shared virtual space accessible via VR. Following the post-earning surge, Microsoft (MSFT) unseated Apple (AAPL) as the world’s most valuable company by market cap. Tesla (TSLA) shares continued their monster run, closing above $1100 for a new all-time high. Congrats bulls, we getting paid! Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) disclosed plans to expand drilling in the top US shale basin in West Texas after posting biggest quarterly profits in years amid elevated energy prices. Squid Game Director Hwang Dong-hyuk confirmed there will be a season 2 but said he is “not a priority” right now. Netflix (NFLX) stock was up 2.5% today to reach a new ATH. After lagging other tech companies in the last year or so, Netflix stocks has been on absolute fire following the release of Squid Game, the most popular show ever on the platform. It is reported Netflix made roughly $900 million* from the show. Shares of Starbucks (SBUX) plummeted 6% after reporting earnings miss amid slowing sales in China. The European Commission opened a full-scale investigation into NVIDIA (NVDA) plpanned $54 billion bid for semiconductor designer ARM. Very basically, the problem is that tons of companies, including Apple’s new M1 chip are designed using ARM architecture, other chip companies are worried that NVDA’s takeover could damage competition. In response NVDA has insisted it would maintain ARM as a “tech neutral” supplier. **Please note that current stock price was written premarket and may not reflect closing prices** Apple (AAPL) target raised by Oppenheimer from $165 to $170 at Outperform.

,"PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, October 29, 2021 The remarkable rally in equities continued, with stocks jumping despite two of the largest companies, Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN), posting disappointing earnings results in an otherwise solid earnings season. The S&P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) both closed the week at record closing levels. Coming into Q3 earnings season, market participants were worried the persistent supply-chain disruptions and labor market imbalances would hamper corporate profits, so it is very encouraging to see companies holding up better than expected. Recent economic data has also contributed to the bounce in equities. After suffering its first -5% dip in September, the SPY has come back with a vengeance, advancing more than 7% from the October 4 bottom. In this same time period, the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped a staggering 10% and the Dow Jones (DIA) gained 5%. Not to toot my own horn too much, but I publicly remained bullish during September volatility and consistently encouraged dip-buying via this recap. Happy to say the strategy, as it has all year, worked great and personally resulted in my most profitable month all year. Hope some of y'all took advantage. Never try to fight market trends, much easier to ride them until you can’t anymore. As I have said for like six months at this point, I think the trend will change once the Fed begins discussing interest rate hikes. When that happens, I’ll reassess my position. Until then I see any and all dips as buying opportunities. Amazon (AMZN) shares dropped after the e-commerce juggernaut missed third-quarter expectations and forecasted a jump in expenses in the fourth quarter due to supply chain disruptions and rising costs for labor, materials and freight. These factors are expected to generate ""several billion dollars of additional costs"" to Amazon in the current quarter, the company said in its earnings statement. Here are the numbers: Earnings: $6.12 vs $8.92 per share expected Revenue: $110.81 billion vs $111.6 billion expected Q4 Guidance: Amazon forecast sales between $130 billion and $140 billion Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Prime Subs: $55.9 billion Net product sales: $54.9 billion Apple (AAPL) also disappointed Wall Street in its fiscal first-quarter results, with key iPhone sales missing expectations, with the launch of the iPhone 13 hampered by the global shortage in semiconductors that forced Apple to massively cut down on production, new rules that allow third-party payment systems in the App store, and supply chain issues, which Tim Cook says cost the company more than $6 billion. Key Apple suppliers like Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Qualcomm (QCOM) fell on the miss.
