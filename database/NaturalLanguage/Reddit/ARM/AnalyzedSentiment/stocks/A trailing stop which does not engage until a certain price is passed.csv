,"So recently I’ve started dabbling in IPO’s and I got lucky today with Robinhood’s shares nearly reaching double what I paid on Friday. However for future IPO’s I am wondering if there is a way to set up a “trigger” which “arms” a trailing stop. I.E. Say I buy a stock for 20 dollars, and I’d like a trailing stop that will auto sell should it fall 5% Yet I don’t want that trailing stop to engage until it passes say 35 dollars. Is there a way to do this? Any advice would be most appreciated, thank you.","This doesn't address your question, but I want to share an experience. I only trade on desktop and leave my account alone when on vacation. So I decided to sit up a trailing stop on BNTX for 10%. Well, it had a bad week and sold at or just below my entry. I didn't buy back in when I got home, it's up 400% from that day now. I think the stops are smart for extreme conditions, if you believe in the company, hold.To answer: I don't think so, you would have to wait for it to hit the target price before setting up your trailing stop.",0,0.539,1.0,NEGATIVE

I suspected HOOD would go up quite a bit, but after this i think it will tank hard any moment now. So I would use such an order if I got in early.",1,0.563,0.663,NEGATIVE
