Similar to the US model where tech companies design the chips and outsource the manufacturing to companies like TSMC. A lot of them are based in Cambridge in an area called Silicon Fen or the Cambridge ClusterFor example, Arm’s (a UK-based company now owned by a Japanese company today) designs 95% of smartphones’ chips (Android phones).",4,0.57,0.995,POSITIVE
