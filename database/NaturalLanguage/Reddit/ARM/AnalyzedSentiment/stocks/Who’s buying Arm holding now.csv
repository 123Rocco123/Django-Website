,"Arm is up another 5% so far today. Since the pullback in April, it has been up 40% since. However, the company is way overvalued based on P/S, P/E and forward P/E. The company hasn’t proved itself yet, and for me is just riding the Nvidia wave. Apple held the conference yesterday + analysts upgraded the stock, and yet it’s only up 6% today. Why is Arm up 5% today? The price now sitting at 145 is also way way way up from consensus price. Who’s buying that? Momo crowd?","While they may not have necessarily ""proved"" themselves yet, the companies that use and back them have. There is a lot invested in ARM and while I don't disagree it's at a high price all things considered, I think the companies behind them know what they are doing. It has a promising future, and we're seeing that get priced in. Also, price target from Goldman is $143. They're just barely above that.",0,0.537,POSITIVE,0.863
