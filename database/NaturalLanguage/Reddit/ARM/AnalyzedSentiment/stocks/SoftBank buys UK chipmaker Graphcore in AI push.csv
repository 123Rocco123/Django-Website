,"SoftBank has bought UK-based chipmaker Graphcore, as the Japanese tech group founded by Masayoshi Son accelerates its multibillion-dollar push into artificial intelligence. Graphcore, an AI-focused start-up that was founded by UK semiconductor industry veterans in 2016, will sit alongside chip designer Arm in SoftBank’s portfolio, as Son readies his “next big bet” in the tech industry. “Graphcore will join SoftBank Group to build the next generation of AI compute,” said Nigel Toon, chief executive and co-founder of Graphcore. He said he had conversations with all levels of SoftBank before the deal was agreed: “We are part of the delivery behind a very grand vision.” The money to buy Graphcore is coming from SoftBank Group itself, rather than its Vision Funds, reflecting the strategic nature of the investment.

Among the chip startups, people were calling this one a complete failure. I personally don't know anyone who uses their chips for ML models.",0,0.516,NEGATIVE,1.0

Building AI HW is not the hard part. It is the SW enablement. This is why NVDA CUDA is winning. I don't think this moves the needle for SB/ARM.,0,0.524,POSITIVE,1.0
