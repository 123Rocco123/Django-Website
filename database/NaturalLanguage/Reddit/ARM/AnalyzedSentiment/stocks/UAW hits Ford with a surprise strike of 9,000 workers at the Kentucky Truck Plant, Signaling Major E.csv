UAW President Shawn Fain called for a surprise strike of an estimated 9,000 workers late Wednesday with no warning at the Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, the Detroit Free Press confirmed.

The work shift began at 6 p.m., he said. “We’re meeting right now as we speak,"" he said. ""We’re being chosen to be the next arm of leverage in an international strike. We’re being called on by our leadership.
