(Huge loss) I'll probably be somewhere around 65-75k before taxes this year. This last pay period was almost 7k alone. Most likely I'll eventually become a freelance technician when I have more contacts in the industry and just more experience in general. For now I might as well learn how to be a technical director, and how to talk with client's without getting walked on.

Depending on your state your looking at anywhere from 25%-45% in income taxes so that’s at least a quarter of your interest is returned to you in your tax return. Your capital gains tax from the realized gains of selling those stocks would be 15% (of what you profited only) however if you spend all that on a house down payment (property) then it’s 0%. You’ll have an asset in a house and you can in the future sell that. Plus on a 30 year mortgage the value of the home at the end of 30 years will be more than the total you paid for it. Your cost of living in your area shouldn’t be high if you have a 130k portfolio on a 65k salary at 24, so this all should be feasible. You would still have 50k in portfolios, yet you won’t take as big of a hit when the stock markets inevitably crash one day and you can at least go home to a house. What the housing market is in now is a shortage not a fraud bubble, as more homes are built then yes the price will drop, as long as the prices drop before the next market falls then there shouldn’t be a massive amount of defaulting mortgages like we saw in 08. Don’t look at the house as a liability look at it as an investment.Edit: If you do nothing to the home then for sure here in 10 years at 34 it will be worth 500k unless you destroyed it. If you flip it though, we’re talking making 100k profit in like 3 years or less if you do it right. Think of it as an addition to your portfolio and not a drain on it. You could even possibly rent out the rooms of the house to match the mortgage and then that comes with tons of tax write offs.",2,0.527,1.0,NEGATIVE

When nobody else in my family has anything over 250k. Don't get me wrong I'd loved to flaunt that at all the teachers that doubted me cuz I never did homework 😂.

I’m about to hit 30 and all I do is manage my assets now. I’m not l exceptional. Not smart. I live in the most expensive shithole state in the world (NY). I had a very average job (if not below average). I’ve never been “lucky”—meaning I didn’t buy Bitcoin when it was pennies, or Amazon before it blew up. I just saved a lot like you’re doing. Started buying multi family houses to live in and rent out. Kept investing. Buying houses (in NYC, so yea, it was expensive and risky). I plowed my profits back into equities. Started to get invited to join private placement deals (hang out with successful people, doors will open) and now my net worth is well into the millions. I honestly don’t know how it happened. It just happened. This isn’t some fantasy. I was just disciplined and Diligent. Also, it actually happened bc I got lucky and picked the right VC deals. Getting invited to invest in VC is super exciting, don’t jump at the first opportunity. Thoroughly bet everything. And ask your mentors for guidance. Ask your lawyers. Accountants. Financial advisors. All these people helped me along the way and kept me focused and on track and helped me find great opportunities. I bought a wind turbine company that went public—that was truly wild (turned thousands into hundreds of thousands)— and I got into cannabis super early, but I bought real brands with real potential, like med men (the space is now super saturated and there are too many scams), I also own actual suppliers (one of my companies is a top 5 supplier).",2,0.523,0.989,NEGATIVE

I started to get paranoid and hired a financial advisor. My dad suggested just buying the major etf’s (SPY, QQQ, DIA). Had I listened to him I would have made a lot more. But, with the advisor I feel secure. They also help me with tax planning and answer other questions for me which I like. And they teach me. Funny though, they now only manage about 300k for me. I ended up getting into real estate and Venture capital and only Hold a few hundred thousand in equities now. Of which I personally only play with about $50k on my Own. So 200-250 with an advisor. $50 I trade on my own for fun. Then I own and manage a decent real estate portfolio in NYC and I own some private businesses in cannabis and renewables—one went public, the other just hit a billion valuation (I got into both under $50mm). Now I make money while I sleep and it’s pretty awesome. I’m now in my Late 20’s and a n a really comfortable spot. Patience is key. Discipline and execution are also very important.",0,0.517,0.874,POSITIVE

Honestly, it’s just discipline. It can be really Tough to save. What helped me a lot was when my employer switched to a new payroll system that allowed me to open a savings account with the payroll provider. So I would send half my paycheck to my normal bank account and half to this savings account that I never let myself touch for personal use, strictly investment purposes. When I started splitting my paychecks and diverting a set amount, that’s when things really started to fall into place. I didn’t have the discipline to do it on my own so having the ability to split paychecks and direct deposit money into a new account dedicated only to savings was a game changer.",2,0.521,1.0,NEGATIVE
