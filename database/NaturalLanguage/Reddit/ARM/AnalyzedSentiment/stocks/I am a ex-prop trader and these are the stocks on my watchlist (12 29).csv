,"I am a ex-prop trader working in US equities and these are the stocks on my watchlist (12/29). I don't expect much trading because the markets around the holiday season are usually pretty slow.

I left my firm right before COVID, and traded a decent amount during that time and did well during that time period/bull period.I also got extremely lucky investing in a friend's ICO when he started his own token (it was seeded by Binance at the time so it wasn't a scam or rug pull, and still exists today).I made enough money to be comfortable, but not enough to be able to retire. Right now I do grad school part-time because I've always wanted a more technical background for business ideas I want to pursue, but mainly I just pursue my interests (skiing)I haven't been that active since SVB (which was also another great time period for me) but I've wanted to get my feet wet again in the markets since I've been away for so long, this is one of my ways of doing so.",1,0.539,POSITIVE,0.911

Note, this is not a liquidity concern for banks, but is because they are profiting form low rates offered by the fed to profit form arbitrage.Russia has been pummelling Ukraine with airstrikes overnight, killing 12 people.We can see that the data is telling us that bond yields will continue to be pressured, as option volatility skew on TLT hits a record high, as IV in OTM calls surges.""This is an excerpt from his report- what actionable trades or tickers can you see from this information? Can you design a profitable trade from TLT knowing that vol skew in TLT is reaching a high due to OTM calls surging?I think that his news is great to serve as a general newsletter for what is going on today, but a lot of it isn't actionable as a day trader. If you think news like that has edge, then go for it! If you're a macro fund or money manager (like he is) that wants to beat the market, then having knowledge of this is extremely useful, but if you're an individual investor/trader, you are probably going to have 0 edge from knowing that Russia is airstriking Ukraine after close to two years of being at war. Day Trading and being a professional Money Manager are two completely different fields and require different skillsets.What I focus on is pure day trading. I look for stocks that are in the spotlight today. Yes, that means sometimes these stocks are sometimes considered volatile like ""Chinese education stocks"".The average US professional day trader is likely going to tell you that there is no edge in knowing that the Spain preliminary reading for December is coming up. Do you see edge in it? Can you tell me what will move as a result of those numbers being released? How are you going to trade that move? Is the research and effort you put into this trade worth the money you make from it? How are you going to structure that trade using equities? If you can answer all those questions then you're a better trader than I am.I don't own any of these stocks. I wouldn't hold any of them as long-term investments, but I'd day trade them.
