,"Note All Personal Opinion, not Financial Advice. Introduction: Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) has recently announced the release of GTA VI almost a decade after the initial release of GTA V. On top of that, their acquisition of Zynga has created a new frontier in the mobile gaming space for them to conquer. TTWO is a company that creates a few strong IPs that they will monetize for decades to come in the form of Downloadable Content (DLC), where DLC is not a necessity rather it is simply a way to enhance the experience. However, given their usual model going forward, there is a lot of uncertainty as we're unsure of how GTA VI will be positioned in their ecosystem of IPs, how the advertising revenue from Zynga will look like, and how much cost savings/efficiencies can be realized from their merger with Zynga. Revenue: TTWO has 2 revenue streams, “Recurrent Consumer Spending” and “Full Games and Others”. Recurrent Consumer Spending refers to DLCs Full Games and Others refers to Full Game sales and Advertising. I split Full Games and Others further into Full Game Sales and Advertising. When forecasting Full Game sales, I took TTWO’s most popular title GTA V as a proxy for games sold across all platforms (SOURCE) and how profitable games will be for video game sales. The rationale lies in the difficulty in estimating the total copies of video games sold across all of TTWO’s subsidiaries. Management has stated ""12 titles in fiscal '24, 36 in the following two years.” - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference."" TTWO expects to release a higher-than-average amount of titles from 2025 to 2026(36 in the following two years), so I’d assume that copies sold tend higher than average in these 2 years and remain elevated for 3 years for the novelty of the games to die down. When forecasting Revenue/Copies, I assumed that management keeps prices more or less at the same prices. So, I only accounted for half of the perpetual inflation in the sales price of games sold to reflect the lack of pricing power game studios have when selling their games. “The industry, as a whole, offers a terrific price-to-value opportunity for consumers. That doesn't necessarily mean that the industry has pricing power"" - 2024 Q2 Earnings Conference. When forecasting Recurrent Consumer Spending, I used GTA V as a benchmark again, taking the running count of GTA V copies sold. As TTWO switches gear to be more focused on DLC, especially with their Zynga acquisition. With the elevated release of new games, I’d assume that DLC spend remains in line with inflation for the duration of high growth for copies sold. DLC begins to increase towards the end of my forecast period as gamers become more well-acquainted with certain flagship titles e.g. GTA VI and are more willing to spend on DLC. When forecasting Advertising, given that this is a new arm of the business for TTWO as it came from the Zynga acquisition. Not much information was given so to avoid being overly optimistic I forecasted it in line with inflation. Cost: Overall, When forecasting any cost item I took into account the fact that costs are elevated for TTWO due to their merger with Zynga. The costs will not tend back to FY22’s level as they now have to support the operations from Zynga. However, I believe that the merger may have led to some cost savings in the later parts of my forecast. When forecasting COGS, I took into account “jobs can be made a whole lot easier and more efficient by developments in AI, and we're certainly looking forward to that. And as I said, we're already putting it in practice every day.” - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. TTWO has large faith & investment in AI which could lower production costs. So going forward I assumed that COGS tended downwards slightly. When forecasting Marketing, I assumed that marketing remains elevated for FY24 - FY27 where TTWO will have the largest growth in copies sold due to their large amounts of new games released. Afterward, I assume that marketing tapers down but remains slightly elevated to continuously raise awareness for their IPs. When forecasting R&D, opting for less granularity I assumed that R&D expenditure slightly tapers downwards before remaining constant throughout my forecast. When forecasting G&A, I took into account “operating expenses are expected to grow by approximately 7% year over year, driven by higher personnel and depreciation expenses, which are being partially offset by the Zynga synergies and our cost-savings initiatives.” 2024 Q2 Earnings Conference. To avoid being overly granular I assumed G&A will not taper downwards too much and it takes 4 years for TTWO to be rid of any inefficiencies. When forecasting Others, opting for less granularity I assumed that Others remain constant throughout my forecast. CapEX and D&A: When forecasting CapEX and D&A, I took into account historical ROIC and %Earnings Reinvested. I'd assume that the D&A is elevated due to the amortization of intangible assets from the Zynga merger. So, in perpetuity, this elevated number from FY2023 will smoothen out.Sanity Check: [INSERT] WACC: US bond is rated “AA+” AA risk spread (1M Avg) = 0.55% US 10Y T-Bond (1M Avg) = 4.16% RFR = 3.61% Beta (SOURCE) = 0.75 4050 = (4050 * 4.25%) * (1+16%) / (1+R) + [((4050 * 4.25%) * (1+16%)) * (1+3.82%) / (R - 3.82%)] / (1 + R) ^ 2 R = 10.30%, ERP = 6.69% Cost of Equity = 8.63% TTWO is BBB-rated (SOURCE) BBB bond yield (1M Avg) = 5.60% US Marginal Corporate Tax Rate = 21.00% Cost of Debt = 4.42% Stock Price (5D Avg) = $161.10 Shares O/S = 169M Market Value of Equity = 27226M Weighted Average Duration of Debt = 3 Years 2023 Interest Expense = 108.60M Market Value of Debt = 2670M %Debt = 8.93% %Equity = 91.07% %WACC = 8.25% Conclusion: Ultimately, in my base case, I value TTWO at $133.14/share. However, in my best case, I value TTWO at $213.03/share I believe the discrepancy between the forecasted price and the actual stock price lies in the uncertainty of how TTWO will move forward. There are a few questions such as how well will their new IPs e.g. GTA VI in FY24 and FY25 perform, how will the cost savings from the Zynga merger materialize, and what advertising revenue from Zynga will look like. Due to the recency of the merger as well, there isn't a large number of well-established historical data to base numbers on so that could also lead to over-optimism. However, I believe in the strength of TTWO's expected IPs and the mobile gaming space is rapidly expanding especially given the rising prevalence of smartphones in developing markets, these smartphones serve as their first introduction to online gaming.

When forecasting G&A, I took into account “operating expenses are expected to grow by approximately 7% year over year, driven by higher personnel and depreciation expenses, which are being partially offset by the Zynga synergies and our cost-savings initiatives.” 2024 Q2 Earnings Conference. To avoid being overly granular I assumed G&A will not taper downwards too much and it takes 4 years for TTWO to be rid of any inefficiencies. When forecasting Others, opting for less granularity I assumed that Others remain constant throughout my forecast. CapEX and D&A: When forecasting CapEX and D&A, I took into account historical ROIC and %Earnings Reinvested. I'd assume that the D&A is elevated due to the amortization of intangible assets from the Zynga merger.

,"Note All Personal Opinion, not Financial Advice. Introduction: Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) has recently announced the release of GTA VI almost a decade after the initial release of GTA V. On top of that, their acquisition of Zynga has created a new frontier in the mobile gaming space for them to conquer. TTWO is a company that creates a few strong IPs that they will monetize for decades to come in the form of Downloadable Content (DLC), where DLC is not a necessity rather it is simply a way to enhance the experience. However, given their usual model going forward, there is a lot of uncertainty as we're unsure of how GTA VI will be positioned in their ecosystem of IPs, how the advertising revenue from Zynga will look like, and how much cost savings/efficiencies can be realized from their merger with Zynga. Revenue: TTWO has 2 revenue streams, “Recurrent Consumer Spending” and “Full Games and Others”. Recurrent Consumer Spending refers to DLCs Full Games and Others refers to Full Game sales and Advertising. I split Full Games and Others further into Full Game Sales and Advertising. When forecasting Full Game sales, I took TTWO’s most popular title GTA V as a proxy for games sold across all platforms (SOURCE) and how profitable games will be for video game sales. The rationale lies in the difficulty in estimating the total copies of video games sold across all of TTWO’s subsidiaries. Management has stated ""12 titles in fiscal '24, 36 in the following two years.” - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference."" TTWO expects to release a higher-than-average amount of titles from 2025 to 2026(36 in the following two years), so I’d assume that copies sold tend higher than average in these 2 years and remain elevated for 3 years for the novelty of the games to die down. When forecasting Revenue/Copies, I assumed that management keeps prices more or less at the same prices. So, I only accounted for half of the perpetual inflation in the sales price of games sold to reflect the lack of pricing power game studios have when selling their games. “The industry, as a whole, offers a terrific price-to-value opportunity for consumers. That doesn't necessarily mean that the industry has pricing power"" - 2024 Q2 Earnings Conference. When forecasting Recurrent Consumer Spending, I used GTA V as a benchmark again, taking the running count of GTA V copies sold. As TTWO switches gear to be more focused on DLC, especially with their Zynga acquisition. With the elevated release of new games, I’d assume that DLC spend remains in line with inflation for the duration of high growth for copies sold. DLC begins to increase towards the end of my forecast period as gamers become more well-acquainted with certain flagship titles e.g. GTA VI and are more willing to spend on DLC. When forecasting Advertising, given that this is a new arm of the business for TTWO as it came from the Zynga acquisition. Not much information was given so to avoid being overly optimistic I forecasted it in line with inflation. Cost: Overall, When forecasting any cost item I took into account the fact that costs are elevated for TTWO due to their merger with Zynga. The costs will not tend back to FY22’s level as they now have to support the operations from Zynga. However, I believe that the merger may have led to some cost savings in the later parts of my forecast. When forecasting COGS, I took into account “jobs can be made a whole lot easier and more efficient by developments in AI, and we're certainly looking forward to that. And as I said, we're already putting it in practice every day.” - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. TTWO has large faith & investment in AI which could lower production costs. So going forward I assumed that COGS tended downwards slightly. When forecasting Marketing, I assumed that marketing remains elevated for FY24 - FY27 where TTWO will have the largest growth in copies sold due to their large amounts of new games released. Afterward, I assume that marketing tapers down but remains slightly elevated to continuously raise awareness for their IPs. When forecasting R&D, opting for less granularity I assumed that R&D expenditure slightly tapers downwards before remaining constant throughout my forecast. When forecasting G&A, I took into account “operating expenses are expected to grow by approximately 7% year over year, driven by higher personnel and depreciation expenses, which are being partially offset by the Zynga synergies and our cost-savings initiatives.” 2024 Q2 Earnings Conference. To avoid being overly granular I assumed G&A will not taper downwards too much and it takes 4 years for TTWO to be rid of any inefficiencies. When forecasting Others, opting for less granularity I assumed that Others remain constant throughout my forecast. CapEX and D&A: When forecasting CapEX and D&A, I took into account historical ROIC and %Earnings Reinvested. I'd assume that the D&A is elevated due to the amortization of intangible assets from the Zynga merger. So, in perpetuity, this elevated number from FY2023 will smoothen out.Sanity Check: [INSERT] WACC: US bond is rated “AA+” AA risk spread (1M Avg) = 0.55% US 10Y T-Bond (1M Avg) = 4.16% RFR = 3.61% Beta (SOURCE) = 0.75 4050 = (4050 * 4.25%) * (1+16%) / (1+R) + [((4050 * 4.25%) * (1+16%)) * (1+3.82%) / (R - 3.82%)] / (1 + R) ^ 2 R = 10.30%, ERP = 6.69% Cost of Equity = 8.63% TTWO is BBB-rated (SOURCE) BBB bond yield (1M Avg) = 5.60% US Marginal Corporate Tax Rate = 21.00% Cost of Debt = 4.42% Stock Price (5D Avg) = $161.10 Shares O/S = 169M Market Value of Equity = 27226M Weighted Average Duration of Debt = 3 Years 2023 Interest Expense = 108.60M Market Value of Debt = 2670M %Debt = 8.93% %Equity = 91.07% %WACC = 8.25% Conclusion: Ultimately, in my base case, I value TTWO at $133.14/share.
