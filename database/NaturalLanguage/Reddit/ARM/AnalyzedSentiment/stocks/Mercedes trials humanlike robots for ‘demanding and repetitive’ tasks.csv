,"Mercedes-Benz is trialling humanlike robots for “demanding and repetitive” tasks in one of its factories as the carmaker finds it increasingly hard to find reliable workers. Standing at 5ft 8in and weighing 160 pounds, the humanoid Apollo robots from Texan group Apptronik will be used to deliver parts to car assembly lines as well as to carry out quality inspections. Each model can lift up to 55 pounds.  While use of large mechanical arms to carry out functions from lifting entire cars to installing some parts is common across the auto industry, this is one of the first uses of robots with a human appearance.  They allow carmakers to increase automation in factories without making expensive changes to their layout, because the robots can walk through spaces designed for people.

I think it's one of the better designs that I've seen.I will say however, that I think this entire industry is about 10 years too early, to get excited about, but of course people can't help but try to speculate deep in the future. Humanoid robots will be a part of everyone's daily lives in the next 50 years, this is a fact. But people spending embarrassing amounts of time, daily in the metaverse is also a fact. A lot of things can happen in 50 years.So, should we worry about humanoid robots from an investing perspective so early? Well, seems the vast majority of players in this field and private anyways, and I don't know of any of them that are talking IPO.You've got:Apptronik with ApolloAgility Robotics with Digit (Amazon owns a stake)Figure with Figure 11X with NeoUnitree with H1The only publicly traded ones are Hyundai (owners of Boston Dynamics and their Atlas robot) as well as Tesla with their Optimus robot.",0,0.517,POSITIVE,0.996

We've made a lot of strides in mimicking human dexterity but they still seem a good ways off from having the task flexibility of a human.I'd be really interested to see how much they currently cost, just in parts alone. A standard articulated robot has six joints, with the corresponding sensors and motors. A humanoid robot has more than that just in one hand.",1,0.518,NEGATIVE,0.595

The constraint was chip and engineering capabilities. Think about how fast technology has changed in the past two decades. There's been more innovation the past five years than probably the past 50 years before that in the tech/engineering space.Humanoid robots won't be an if but an when. I think what most people think to be unachievable are actually very achievable to those in the industry. 20 years ago, you would have never guessed that a phone would be able to play video games better than a GameBoy, be 100x better than the current computer they had at that time, and you could charge the phone thousands of times and it would still work. Or, you could send a video call to someone from an entirely different continent at no cost.",2,0.532,NEGATIVE,0.998

I'm an engineer in manufacturing and some of the demo's I've seen are truly impressive, especially with vision systems. I think we are going to have some pretty amazing prototypes within the next couple decades.I think the challenge is getting these things out of the cool prototype stage and to an actual product that will pay themselves off. There are a lot of technologies that are more matured and aren't advancing at nearly the same rate as chips have. Electric motors have advanced a lot since the 1800s but to get something from iRobot we're going need something revolutionary to happen (affordable room temp. super conductor).",3,0.524,POSITIVE,1.0

That's why it's also very exciting to see the direction of this. Economic humanoid robots could fundamentally change the way we live and something like that would not be easy or else it wouldn't have much value.I don't necessarily think it has to reach the levels of a human physically. Just enough to where it can handle most tasks and the ones that can't could still be completed by humans. Reduce the most tedious of tasks.,4,0.518,POSITIVE,0.999
