,"I'm a big believer in ARM based CPU architecture. ARM dominates the mobile world and soon all Apple products. I think ARM will eventually dominate datacenters too, and possibly all consumer PCs eventually. What are the best companies to invest in ARM? Specifically for datacenter / consumer PC growth? Is it possible to invest in ARM Holdings from the USA? It seems to only be listed in London. Some other companies I looked for are not public companies. I think Apple, maybe NVDA might be good but what others are there that are publicly traded in the USA?","Xilinx, which is being acquired by AMD. Plus Lisa Su has said several times she’s open to ARM CPUs.",0,0.612,0.761,POSITIVE

I think Apple, maybe NVDA might be good but what others are there that are publicly traded in the USA?","ARM (Advanced RISC Machine) Architecture is done exclusively by the company Arm Ltd. The company is not publicly traded, as it is owned solely by SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, who bought the British company in 2016 for $32B. He plans to take the company public again by 2023.Currently Arm Ltd. leases it’s tech to other semiconductor and chip companies. US company Nvidia is supposedly pushing hard to buy Arm and essentially corner the market on high end computing hardware. I don’t know how feasible that acquisition actually would be, or if Son would even consider selling it. Otherwise there is no way to “buy ARM” that I know of.Please correct me if any of this is wrong. I’ve only briefly looked into each of these companies.",0,0.581,1.0,NEGATIVE
