,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD. MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","Totally cool for you to start this thread. If others are reading this it would be awesome if others in other equity markets OUTSIDE of U.S. could chime in on interesting stocks from their country as well.OP, it would be great if you could focus on the stocks that trade OTC, i.e. an F series (ticker ending in F). These would be the ones most of us U.S. folks would have access to as investing options.Thanks in advance.",0,0.523,0.999,POSITIVE

AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD. MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","Thank you!This is a new concept for me. My stock broker looks a bit diffrent than yours I am sure. I am trying to use Yahoo finance to find the US-tickers which differ.Would this be the proper ticker?

,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom.

These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking.

MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","Most of the foreign securities will be traded on OTC markets and usually have 5 letter tickers with an ""F"" at the end signifying ""foreign shares"". Have also seen some end in ""Y"" as well for ""holdings"". Of course, well known companies will just be traded on the big boards as well as the native companies equity markets.If you see interesting stocks we would be interested to know just google the company name with ""OTC markets"" and it will show up on google if it exists for U.S. investors to easily invest.Thanks in advance.p.s. would be AWESOME to have other folks chip in on their country's ""hidden gems"" as well in a separate appropriately titled thread.

Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD.

,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%.

This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD. MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","I agree, trading outside your own region is always a pain.

,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits.

With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD.

,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall.

The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD.

When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD.

,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game?

This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD.

,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden.

Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD. MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","I live in Norway, also a Swedish Match snus user myself :)Pandox isn’t a super exciting stock, but it’s a safe recovery play imo.

,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB.

Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD. MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","I don’t think it will be a home run at this point by any means, but I do think it will beat the market for the next year or two.I believe all of Stordalen’s investments/hotels are private.",4,0.572,0.891,POSITIVE
,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely.

I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD.

,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden.

The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant.

Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD. MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","What are your thoughts on Ericsson(ERIC), although they did lose a large portion of their market share in the rapidly growing Chinese market for 5G they’re increasing sales in other markets like the US, Europe, and Latin America due to huawei being excluded from many of those markets mentioned above.

,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july.

These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking.

MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","Okey, now I have the time so i will try to formulate an answer. Mind you that I will be doing some speculating, based on what I've experienced both as a former employee but also in the news overall concerning Ericsson. As for the stock price I assume that the US-listed version trades along with the Ericsson B-stock in sweden, and not too independently.Since the introduction of the ""smart-phone"" really, Ericsson have had a bit of an identity crisis. The company that invented the phone, no longer produced phones. This was a major blow to their industry, especially when iPhone 3 launched in Sweden and overnight everyone stopped buying the Ericsson phones. Speculating a bit I think they invested a lot of money in trying to catch up, but failed in the end. I remember just before Iphone 3 launched I would see commercials everywhere about the new ""Ericsson Walkman"" etc.The core enterprise for Ericsson has always been patents. They research, patent and then earn massive royalities on these patents. But research can only be done to such a degree. In trying to expand the enterprise Ericsson have used it's patent gains to buy or found diffrent industrial or infrastructual companies that are to some degree related to their research. These bransches would grow and then they would sell the deparments off, or shut them down if they proved costly. The phrase ""return to our core values"" would be used and thousands of people would loose their jobs as production was moved outside of Sweden to lower production costs. This would reflect badly on Ericsson, but they would earn their money and then invest in ramping up more research for more patents. This is the ""Ericsson-cycle"" and it continues still.Now for the problems. Back in 08 when the financial crisis hit, Ericsson along with several other IT giants in Sweden (Telia, for example) employed a savings program. This program said that for every dime a boss saved on their department, they would earn a percentage (simplified) as a bonus. Now aside from firing tons of people and making bad choices these bosses made a mistake that Ericsson still pays for today. They sold all the company owned property, every single building. And then they would make a 15 year agreement to rent the building at a low cost. The problem was, these buildings were sold at way below market price and the lease agreements were limited in time. The bosses would fiddle the numbers and oh look their appartment ""saved"" 100 million USD in expenses. The boss would get a fat bonus and then retire, laughing all the way to the bank. (EDIT: was looking for a source, turns out this happened in 02, not 08. Likewise the same. You can directly translate this article, it should show the whole picture. https://www.aftonbladet.se/minekonomi/a/yv42JJ/bonus-till-varje-pris)In 2018 these agreements expired and all of a sudden the real estate brokers like Klöver that bought these buildings wanted to re-negotiate the fee. Well big surprise the buildings sold at 10% of market price in 08 was now worth 10's if not 100 times what they were sold for. And trust me, these aren't any ""cheap"" buildings. Google ""Ericsson Kista HQ"". Well this resulted in massive expenses and a savings programme was introduced in order to raise money to buy back these buildings, or at least renew the lease-agreement. The company then cut off all their ""non-core assets"", including my deparment, and raised enough money to solve their problems. But now they had another issue, dropping patent earnings. Ericsson then decided to go all in on 5G and profile itself almost exclusevly to this.The 5G investments still haven't payed off, but when they do Ericsson will start to properly thrive again as a buisness. But 5G roll-out in Europe/US is still in an early stage, hence the stock market is sceptical. I would guess that it will take another 1-2 years before we see the company start rising properly again. But I fear that it will never come near it's ATH, not in the near future anyway. That opportunity was forever lost when those former bosses screwed the company over for personal gain.In short, expect that the stock will trade sidewise for another 1-2 years and then maybe make 50-100% increase over time. In the long run Ericsson is a safe investment, it won't drop, but it will likely not outperform the Index before 5G is deployed everywhere.",1,0.54,1.0,NEGATIVE

This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD. MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","I actually used to work at Ericsson haha.I'll formulate a better answer later, when I have all the info, but in general I agree with you. However Ericsson is a bohemoth of a company so you might not get a very high increase in value of your stock, but in return the company at large is quite unlikely to make any major drops (if you buy now) and you will get a constant stream of dividends.I would say the same can be said for Telia and AstraZeneca. The latter shpuld be avalible on NASDAQ so you don't have to bother with the exchange.I'll get back to you later when I have the time. 🙂",1,0.574,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB.

It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD. MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","Absolut, jag handlar på båda börser men har på senare tid breddat min position i Sverige eftersom jag fått bättre avkastning och därför hittat dessa ""pärlor"".Lycka till!",1,0.503,0.993,NEGATIVE
,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely.

MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","As a fellow Nordic I'd just like to say thank you. Ive been big on steel for a while and have been eyeing SSAB for an entry. I support your DD pretty heavily on it and would like to add that steel has the possibility to continue its run, and have HRC prices consolidate further. I'll be taking a position in SSAB with my next paycheck.Also found Azelio to be very interesting.To try to return the favour, I'll mention two stocks from Norway (who are sort of two in one): VGM and VOW. The first one is a factory for creating biofuel for steel mills that is currently under construction. They have already secured a contract with MT, which is the biggest steel producer and they spun of from VOW. The mother company is a waste management business, that mainly gains revenue from waste system related to cruise and marine ships. They've got an excellent leadership and are securing contracts left and right with big and reputable companies, and as the cruise sector is still very much a reopening play there's plenty of room to grow in my opinion.But as the case of VGM shows, Vow continues to look for new markets where they can develop waste management technology and add new value from waste, which is something I'm quite bullish on for the green shift coming up.They are obviously growth companies (VGM very much so), but I see a bright future with them thanks to how they're securing contracts with the big boys. I'm typing this out on my phone, so can't really show you the deets and all that, but I'd be happy to provide more concrete information when I have the time and if it is of interest.Thank you again for sharing your DD, thorough and interesting cases!EDIT: I'm sure there's nothing special except for voting rights and what not, but are there any differences between share class A and B for SSAB? B class seems to be moving ever so slightly slower than A class shares - maybe it is because long forward looking institutions and other types of big buyers will look to acquire A class shares for the voting privilege? I'm such a small timer that I don't really care about voting, and would just prefer to get more shares out of my cash, so if my rational of difference between A and B class is right I guess B-class is the way to go for me?",0,0.541,0.987,NEGATIVE
,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD. MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","Thank you! SSAB and Azelio are in the top 5 of my biggest long-term plays. I agree with you on steel futures, most likely we will see a steady increase in price until the next thing to affect construction and manufacturing. Something I did not mention in the post, because it felt too speculative, is that I believe SSAB will be a large winner on the expanded EU-regulations on carbon emissions. As I've understood it they will scale up import taxes on for example steel by 2% annually up until 2035. This means SSAB, and other European steel manufacturers, will be able to either annually raise their EBIT-marigin or kick the Asian steel plants completely off the market.I will most definetly be looking into VOW and VGM.As for your question on A vs. B stock you want to buy the B-stock. Right now the A-stock is traded higher because funds and institutions are more well informed and have thus increased their position where they can get the largest vote. You as a private retail investor want to get the B-stock as it will usually trade above the A-stock and because the dividends are larger in the B-stock (traditionally) - which will ultimetly affect the stock price. I recall the target price is 44 SEK on the A-stock, while the target price is well above 60 on the B-stock.",1,0.564,0.775,NEGATIVE

As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD. MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","Yes, the interesting thing about the steel play is all the protectionism. I'm trying to play both sides, with shares in CLF, MT and SSAB. CLF is my U.S. play being the biggest american steel producer which is certain to gain from the newly approved infrastructure deal, MT overlaps as it is the global leader of steel production and sells to both EU and U.S. markets, and I see SSAB as a great play for the EU Green Deal drive that is bound to come. Great stuffs.I have seen varying price estimates for both A and B class stock, but seeing as we are kinda on the same page on what to buy I'll go with my gut and DCA into the B-class. Thanks a lot for the reply and insight!",2,0.533,1.0,POSITIVE
,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests.

This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD. MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","It has been following a pretty awesome scalping channel for the last year or so. I've managed to scalp 5 times for 18-25% gains, and it's starting to feel a little bit to good to be true. I would start looking to re-enter around 21 myself.I keep like 50% of my position in CLF, and scalp the rest. It's been good!",4,0.538,0.999,POSITIVE
,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB.

A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland.

The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%.

It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD. MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","NANOThe name rings a bell, and I believe it is one that is rather often discussed in the retail trading communities related to OSBX that I watch. I don't really do biotech as I have far to little knowledge, and don't really enjoy the wild fluctuations that can come with these stocks. Basically: Volatility combined with lack of knowledge just makes me stay away tbh.That says nothing about the quality of the case nor the company, it's just something I have a principle to stay away from lol.",2,0.531,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely.

Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD.

,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden.

Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD. MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","Beowulf Mining PLCThat's one is interesting, I checked their ""Admission to trading on AIM"" on London Stock Exchange, on their investor relations, in part 5 paragraph 9 they confirm there is no withholding tax in dividends.",1,0.537,0.801,POSITIVE
,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant.

Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector.

The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD.

,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories.

As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD.

Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD. MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.",As a swede i love this post but there are definitely more interesting picks in the Swedish market. These are all industrial stocks that already had a huge run up in 2020 and will most likely be pretty flat until 2022. Just my opinion tho,0,0.528,0.811,NEGATIVE
,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland.

VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD. MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","As a Norwegian, I appreciate this!

,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB?

Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD.

,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments.

The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August.

When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD. MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","Hej!I'm not too well informed about the industry at large, sorry. If you are looking into the rental-industry I believe that is a high-risk play due to the market prospects. As for builders/renovators that sell apartments I believe the Covid-situation may provide a boom for the industry. I've in my current employment (as a project manager in infrastructure) seen that we have a great increase of old offices and hostels being transformed into apartments. This could probably provide for a new market opportunity as I imagine that office-space requirements will never truly recover.Mind you housing-prices are at an ATH. If that were to change, the building industry would be the first to crash.",1,0.546,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game?

This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD. MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","Definetly! The reason I didn't include it in the post is that it's gained it's first ""sell"" recommendation due to the recent rally. I am divided on it's future hence I can't recommend it.

,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%.

As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel.

The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally.

Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD. MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","Stort tack! (Thank you)It's great that you share this as I can imagine a lot of people might question ""why just these picks"". I would think so, too. In my case it's truly just because I think it's the best risk/reward companies on the Swedish Stock exchange.I'm really heavy on SSAB, I would say that is by far the best risk/reward. Downside is limited, if even it exists one, and the upside is atleast 40%. My personal estimate is 100-150% within 18 months, assuming Hybrit plays out well.",1,0.539,0.999,POSITIVE
,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin.

It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD. MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","Evolution is a good play, but more in terms of dividends. As for future stock growth I'd say the risk is quite high in regards to the rewars. I'm afraid that unless you already have a position, that ship has sailed.If you want to look into something similar I would recommend Kindred. They have struggled more with the 2018 laws regarding online betting and is just now starting to recover. I made a swing trade there but have closed my position to go heavier on industry which I believe is a more reliable market. I'm not so sure betting companies will improve their value post-covid, quite the opposite really.",1,0.547,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely.

Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD. MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","Thank you for taking the time to read it!SKF is definetly a ""good-will"" enterprise that will remain among the largest manufacturers within ball-bearing(? Swedish word is ""kullager""). I'm not too well informed on the stock at large, but just giving it a quick look it seems like a ""safe"" play in terms of risk. Analysts are divided in their estimates but most seem to say that the stock price is stable and that the company have ""underperformed"". This would indicate a large upside as I imagine the wind turbine-market will continue to grow and the production of contstruction veichles are expected to increase. As for short term, I would probably wait with a larger position up until early october as there likely won't be much movement until the Q3 report presented in late October. Ofcourse anything could happen (hence a small position might be wise). But in short I would expect the stock to remain somewhere from -5/+10% from todays value up until the start of October. This could be a risk-spread if you like the Volvo-stock however. SKF supply both Volvo and it's competition. Meaning if Volvo looses competition, SKF will still grow along with the market.I hope this give some thought on it, but I'm afraid I can't provide any more details on it since it's not a company I have followed too well.SKF-price: 229 SEK = 26,8 USDTP: 180-315 SEK = 21-37 USD.

,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden.

What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD.

,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden.

This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD.

,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories.

As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales).

CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders.

It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom.

Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD.

,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks.

MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","Hey! Glad you're interested in SSAB!Truth be told I don't think SSAB have any major competition issues at the moment in the market at large (I will mention the US market seperately). As for their largest European competitiors they have the following;- High tensile steel; ThyssenKrupp AG, AG der Dillinger Hüttenwerke och Salzgitter AG.- Steel plating; ArcelorMittal S.A., Dillinger Hütte AG, Salzgitter AG, ThyssenKrupp och Voest Alpine.Some of these are also along with SSAB the major competitors for exports to South America and Asia. I would however say that the export market outside of the ""western world"" is the smallest market share for European manufacturers as they compete with local steel plants who have very diffrent climate regulations and productions costs. Especially on the Asian market with China having some major companies to produce volume.Now the reason I don't think any of these pose an issue to SSAB are the following;- SSAB deals in quality over quantity. This is highly beneficial on the current market that has a higher demand than supply. Allowing SSAB to sell all of it's more expensive products.For example this article (in Swedish, sorry) mentions SSAB as the world leader within High tensile steel. https://news.cision.com/se/jernkontoret/r/tre-stalman-delar-pa-kami-priset-om-en-miljon-kronor,c9523396- SSAB, aside from Hybrit, already have a good climate policy making it very popular among Scandinavian manufacturers. It is also my position that the largest European companies focus on other products such as steel beams for constructions. German plants is an exception here as they have a large car- and truck industry and thus a high domestic demand.Now as for the US market SSAB itself mentions the following competitors; Nucor Corporation, ArcelorMittal and Evraz plc. In Canada they mention; Essar Steel Limited.- It is my belief that SSAB, along with other Swedish companies such as ABB, have a very good brand built up making it popular on the US market. While, at the same time competing with US ""nationalism"" that makes American companies choose American products when possible. To compete with this SSAB has started it's own American Enterprise called SSAB Americas. By doing this they have found a way around this barrier and managed to take the largest position on their US market in their section.

However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD. MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","Thank you so much for the reply! I live in Sweden so no worries about the swedish article. The company's financials look good as well after taking a look through them.I was looking for a good value stock to add to my portfolio, especially now that tech stocks, especially in the USA are abit too ""hot"" for my liking, and really the market as a whole.Doesn't hurt to diversify into the materials industry. I was also looking at Sandvik, but the higher PE ratio put me off. Sandvik is in the same industry as SSAB but they're not direct competitors right? So maybe comparing PE ratios isn't that interesting.If you don't mind me asking, what sectors are you heavy in right now?",2,0.547,0.992,NEGATIVE
,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands.

Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries.

This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD. MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","Oh haha!Well Sandvik is also heavy industry, but their products are very diffrent. Sandvik, mainly, sells tools and equipment to process materials like steel. Ergo, SSAB is likely a customer of Sandvik.As for Sandvik at large the official data that I can find indicate nothing that makes me want to buy it. They give out way too much of it's profit in dividends to expand and while the company is stable there seems to be little chance of the stock itself increasing in value.HOWEVER I ran into this lady who claimed to work at Sandvik. She said to look into it because the new CEO is known for having a nose for growing buisnesses. She also threw at me some unofficial ideas that Sandvik would initiate a buy-back program and then go into roll-out mode and start buying up competitors to expand. If this turned out to be true, Sandvik may very well be the best long-term investment one could make - but as of now it's all just rumours. I haven't been able to confirm it. My GFs relative works at Sandvik, next time I meet him I intend to ask if he has heard any of this.I have the following larger companies in my portfolio, they are listed with my largest possession at the top.AAC Clyde Space (Long term possession, possibly will be the winner of the decade)SSABBeowulf Mining PLC (High risk play)Volvo ABLipidor (Recently Accquired)Media and Games InvestAegirBioAzelioSAABAstraZeneca (Recently Accquired)Tele2 (Recently Accquired)Ericsson (Recently Accquired)PEAB (Recently Accquired)Kindered Group (Recently Accquired)Zordix (Reduced possession recently)",3,0.546,0.999,NEGATIVE
,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD. MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","Nice!We do have a facebook group called AAC Clyde Space AB. I'll give you a quick recap though. I've been in the stock since 2017 and I'm just waiting for the boom.AAC Clyde Space, originally ÅAC Microtec, is an aggressive actor on the NewSpace market for cubesats. Basically they make anything from hardware to software and sell data (SDaaS = Space Data as a Service). They have through mergers and purchases become the worlds largest company on the market. 2021 will be their first year with positive EBITDA, and 2022 is estimated to be their first year with positive EBIT (no loans left). They own enterprises in Sweden, UK, Netherland and the US. Big names within the space industry are owners of the company.By June 2021 they had already beaten their estimated revenue for FY21. So I am very bullish on this Q3 report in august. Possibly it could be the last time we see this price level.The market that AAC operates on is vital the the future with everything from 5G to IoT. The market at large, however including other NewSpace aspects, is estimated to surpass the entire GDP of Mexico by 2035. And AMC is the largest actor on the market! It's only proper competition is a danish (but swedish based) company called GomSpace who gained a good rep early when they got a large order from the EU. However they are still struggling financially and is a small enterprise compared to AAC, even if the stock market thinks diffrently due to good IR. I expect AAC to purchase them in the future aswell.As for price range, anything around 3 SEK is a great purchase. Bear case is 4.6 kr, base case is 5.6 kr and bull case is 17.4kr, according to Edison Invest. This is very low, but they say it will increase when they see proof of profitability.Just wanna point something out, their revenue this year is almost at the level of their entire stock value. Think about that one ;)Good luck, hope to see you in the FB-group!",4,0.565,0.951,NEGATIVE

If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD. MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","Nice!We do have a facebook group called AAC Clyde Space AB. I'll give you a quick recap though. I've been in the stock since 2017 and I'm just waiting for the boom.AAC Clyde Space, originally ÅAC Microtec, is an aggressive actor on the NewSpace market for cubesats. Basically they make anything from hardware to software and sell data (SDaaS = Space Data as a Service). They have through mergers and purchases become the worlds largest company on the market. 2021 will be their first year with positive EBITDA, and 2022 is estimated to be their first year with positive EBIT (no loans left). They own enterprises in Sweden, UK, Netherland and the US. Big names within the space industry are owners of the company.By June 2021 they had already beaten their estimated revenue for FY21. So I am very bullish on this Q3 report in august. Possibly it could be the last time we see this price level.The market that AAC operates on is vital the the future with everything from 5G to IoT. The market at large, however including other NewSpace aspects, is estimated to surpass the entire GDP of Mexico by 2035. And AMC is the largest actor on the market! It's only proper competition is a danish (but swedish based) company called GomSpace who gained a good rep early when they got a large order from the EU. However they are still struggling financially and is a small enterprise compared to AAC, even if the stock market thinks diffrently due to good IR. I expect AAC to purchase them in the future aswell.As for price range, anything around 3 SEK is a great purchase. Bear case is 4.6 kr, base case is 5.6 kr and bull case is 17.4kr, according to Edison Invest. This is very low, but they say it will increase when they see proof of profitability.Just wanna point something out, their revenue this year is almost at the level of their entire stock value. Think about that one ;)Good luck, hope to see you in the FB-group!",5,0.565,0.951,NEGATIVE
,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above.

Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD.

,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line.

Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen.

Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD. MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","Oh yeah definetly an interesting company, I just don't have it in my growth-portfolio. I think Embracer will keep growing - just not as aggressively as the mentions in the post. Embracer could probably be a good dividend-play.",1,0.564,0.998,NEGATIVE
,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B.

The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders.

With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD. MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","Embracer is a company that, unlike it's competition, kept their HQ in Sweden and thus followed Swedish Gambling regulations. The competition meanwhile had moved their HQ's to Malta to cheat the gambling rules and tax-legislations. When the tone hardened on this in early 2018 the industry at large took a massive hit but Embracer, already playing by most rules, gained a massive share of the market compared to it's competition. These competing companies have now regained momentum after adapting to the legislation which is why I believe that Embracer will no longer grow as aggressively.Check the graph for Kindred Group, who is based in Malta, and you can make a clear comparison.",2,0.536,0.698,NEGATIVE
,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july.

These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking.

All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD.

,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders.

A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD.

,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos.

The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD. MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","Thanks for the repost!I'm not sure I follow your question. Are you talking about the company paying taxes on dividends or retail investors paying taxes on their earnings?In Sweden we have an account type called ""Investment-savings-account"" or ISK. Using this account type means you pay 0 taxes on your earnings. Instead you pay 0,375 % tax annually on your total possessions on the account. However if I take dividends in the US I do have to pay the US taxes. I doubt that you would be taxed extra as a foreign investor, but your own tax rules will probably apply.",1,0.541,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""?

A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%.

""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD. MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","So you have no idea about dividend overtaxation.

,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies.

The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market.

With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD. MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","Oh now I understand what you mean.As far as I know this does not affect you as an investor. The taxes for dividens are payed by the company, just as they would a salary. Hence when a company say they are giving out 7 SEK in dividends, it actually cost them 10 SEK. The double taxation you are talking about is simply that the company can not make tax deductions in the coming years for a lowered value in it's balance sheet. Which is very logical.I have never had to pay or even specify any dividends in my tax declaration towards the Swedish government. However this is because I use an ""ISK"" account and that is one of it's privledges.",3,0.556,0.607,NEGATIVE
,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july.

These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking.

MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","It actually affects me as foreign tax resident. Swedish tax on dividends is 30%, so I get paid 70%. Here rate is 19%, so but our countries made a treaty and Sweden have right to take 15% maximum, and I should declare and pay here a difference - 4%. in result if I do not use ""relief at source"" scheme (send papers earlier and get 15% taxed) or later reclaim a refund from Sweden tax office, I get taxed 30% by Sweden and may get asked by my one for another 4%. That's my interpretation after some researching, investors should always check tax residency of company they own. Fortunately EU noticed this is a pain in neck for crossborder EU investors and is going to mandate for members a simple and consisted relief at source procedure.

By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD. MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","Duly noted, thank you. I'll try to mention this in the disclamer the next time I post a dividend stock.Some of these stocks do have dividends, but most are still growth companies. Do you pay taxes on your gain in stock-value too or is it only dividends?",5,0.574,0.969,POSITIVE
,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom.

Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD.

,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB.

A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%.

VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD.

,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden. Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential.

Good to know Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9) In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends. Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large. I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD. Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks. When I type 'SG', this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects. TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken. Heavy Industry SSAB B. Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands. When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock. SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in. The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020. VOLVO B (VOLV B) Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon). Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks IN THE WORLD, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB. Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts. Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I. The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2. Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world. Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line. Military Industry SAAB AB (SAAB B) SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""? If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future. Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB. JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG. Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces. A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for two years and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game. Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS. Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen. Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields. This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB. The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%. High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks. The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure. The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks. In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand. Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories. To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3. The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely. CEO interview can be found by searching ""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference"" on the tube. Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical AegirBio (AEGIR) I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD.

,"Greetings from Sweden! This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments. Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think? Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market.

High-tech Industry Azelio (AZELIO) Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make. Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos.

The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one. Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event. The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends. The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders. (EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.) The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors. Gaming Industry Media and Games Invest (M8G) Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games. M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july. This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news. In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long. In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD. MODS: I hope I used the proper flair, I'm new to this subreddit.","Effectively 0 orders for the entirety of 2022, meaning very little market interest has been shown in their product.
