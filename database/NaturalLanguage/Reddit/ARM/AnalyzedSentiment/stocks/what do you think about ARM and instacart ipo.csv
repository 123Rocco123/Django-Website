U may be onto something.Arm Holdings PLCArm Holdings PLC (stylized in lowercase as arm, formerly an acronym for Advanced RISC Machines) is a British semiconductor and software design company based in Cambridge, England. Arm’s primary business is the design of the ARM architecture family of central processing units (CPUs). It also designs other chips, provides software development tools under the DS-5, RealView and Keil brands, and provides systems and platforms, system-on-a-chip (SoC) infrastructure and software. As a ""holding"" company, Arm also holds shares of other companies. Since 2016, it has been owned by Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group. In 2017, a 25% stake of Arm was transferred to the SoftBank Vision Fund, which received investment from the Saudi sovereign fund.Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)In August 2020, Arm signed a three-year agreement with DARPA, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, enabling DARPA researchers to use all of Arm's commercially available technology.Current leadershipChair: Stuart Chambers (since March 2014)Chief Executive: Rene Haas (since February 2022)Arm had a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), and was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. It also had a secondary listing of American depositary receipts on NASDAQ. However Japanese multinational conglomerate SoftBank Group made an agreed offer for Arm on 18 July 2016, subject to approval by Arm's shareholders, valuing the company at £24.3 billion. The transaction was completed on 5 September 2016. A planned takeover deal by Nvidia, announced in 2020, collapsed as of February 2022, with SoftBank subsequently announcing that Arm planned to raise US$8 billion through an IPO on the NASDAQ in 2023, rather than the LSE.*Arm Holdings: Don’t Bail Out Private Equity Giant SoftBankArm Holdings (ARM), the chip design giant, is expected to start trading September 14, 2023 at a ~$49 billion valuation. At $49/share, the midpoint of its IPO price range, Arm Holdings earns an unattractive Stock Rating and is this week’s Danger Zone pick.I think it is fair to say that the ~$49 billion valuation mark is based more on Softbank’s self-dealing in private markets to manipulate the valuation higher than the fundamentals of the company.Specifically, at the midpoint of its IPO price range, the stock’s valuation implies the company will 10x profits and achieve revenue growth well above industry expectations. ARM looks highly overvalued, and does not provide investors any upside potential.",1,0.555,0.574,NEGATIVE
