Yes, they have a nice dividend but not at the expense of such limited growth.I mean, the stock isnt even up 200% since the year 2000... even if you reinvested every dividend, you still arent up too much.They are a great product and a brand name, but what else are they going to do? are they going to capture more market share of something they already own a majority hold in? They also don't pay a dividend nearly as well as other industries with limited growth such as telecom, oil/petroleum and credit cards.",0,0.556,1.0,NEGATIVE

Powerade only holds a around 30% market share but is now partnered with the Olympics and FIFA and there are rumours of CC forming a new business unit in Africa.The main reason for me is their sustainability (or lack thereof), the industry itself is one of the worst polluters and creators of plastic waste and CC is the worst within that. But as the market leaders CC are positioned perfectly to lead a transformation in the industry. They’ve already started in Europe, for example they’ve partnered with one of the largest retailers in Europe to trial refillable bottles instead of plastic (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53406881) The technology is probably still 5-10 years away from being sustainable but this is a long term medium/low risk hold from me",1,0.54,0.998,POSITIVE
