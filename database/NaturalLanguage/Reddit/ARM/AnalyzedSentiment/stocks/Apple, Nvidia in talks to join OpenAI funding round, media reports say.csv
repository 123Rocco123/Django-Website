They’re unprofessional and getting less innovative by the day. Their new AI model (4o and 4o mini), was hyped as an upgrade, but it’s actually worse than the old one. And that Sora project they’re all excited about? It’s no better than the free and open-source LunaAI, which only took a few months to make. Seriously, LunaAI is just as good and it didn’t take forever to develop. OpenAI doesn’t have any fresh ideas either, just rehashing and upgrading their existing models. It’s pretty disappointing.
