In pre-2015, it was widely expected that the Japanese and Koreans battery makers would dominate the battery manufacturing with some European, eg, BASF, in the mix. Remember that Japan pioneered and dominated the lithium ion battery industry since SONY's first successful commercialization in the early 90's; then followed by South Korea (eg, LG, Samsung, SK). Most EV OEMs around the world were already working with them when China locked foreign battery makers out of their market and forced all EV OEMs, local or foreign, to use locally made batteries by local Chinese companies only. Take this WSJ article from 2018[1]:... China requires auto makers to use batteries from one of its approved suppliers if they want to be cleared to mass-produce electric cars and plug-in hybrids and to qualify for subsidies. These suppliers are all Chinese, so such global leaders as South Korea’s LG Chem Ltd and Japan’s Panasonic Corp. are excluded.... Foreign batteries aren’t officially banned in China, but auto executives say that since 2016 they have been warned by government officials that they must use Chinese batteries in their China-built cars, or face repercussions.  That has forced them to spend millions of dollars to redesign cars to work with inferior Chinese batteries, they say.... “We want to comply, and we have to comply,” said one executive with a foreign car maker. “There’s no other option.”The EU's antisubsidy finding 2024/1866 likewise found China's ""Regulation on the Standards of the Automotive Power Battery Industry"" policy designed to keep out foreign competition since 2015[2]. And China's anticompetitive practices against foreign battery competitors were continued under different fiscal/EV subsidies scheme to keep de-subsidizing foreign batteries[3] until fairly recently -- ie, China had to stop these practices as they started exporting EVs to the world last couple of years under the false (and laughable) pretense that China always complies with all international trade rules and their subsidies are fair.Power Play: How China-Owned Volvo Avoids Beijing’s Battery Rules Car maker is allowed to use high-end foreign technology, while rivals are squeezed into buying local, Trefor Moss, May 17, 2018 6:12 am ET, WSJParagraph (229) of EU Implementation of Regulation 2024/1866, July 03, 2024, the EU.Section 3.6.2.
