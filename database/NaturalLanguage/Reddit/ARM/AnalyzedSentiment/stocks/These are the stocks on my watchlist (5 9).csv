But if you have any questions, I'm happy to answer them!EDIT: Also, I listed GME which WAS worth trading today- I noted multiple times over the past few days that GME was worth watching at $17- it did reach that level today and went to $18 at the close.I frankly think that issuing predictions or in-depth analysis when trading isn't very helpful because there are so many factors to list for so many niche situations. I don't care that a certain stock is downgraded or that they had a 6% YoY increase in revenue or their power plant has a power outage.I can't say ""I predict GME is going to start moving in the last hour of the close"" because I can't see the future. If I could I'd be a billionaire. What I CAN say are the price points for a stock are most interesting to me and likely to prelude actual volatility.It's important to know the general context behind these moves (which is why I write out short descriptions instead of just giving the tickers), but I can't write out everything I think- otherwise I'd spend the entire day writing this post and 0 time trading.Edit: u/AbbreviationsNo6897 responded to your comment here because I can't seem to reply to you:Good points- I agree with your points that finding out what style suits you best. It's important to note that this watchlist to view through a day trading perspective.When you day trade, you want volatility. On any average day, there isn't going to be much edge in trading something like BND or DIA or BP unless there's a major catalyst.I think what most people don't realize is that the top traders are usually in the same opportunities. We've seen GME make huge, multi-point moves for the past week daily. Most of the professional traders who do this for a living that I know have been trading GME on both the long and short side. I've traded the ZK IPO (which I pointed yesterday was worth watching) that I've seen no mention of in the subreddits I frequent, yet most of the professional traders I know watch almost EVERY IPO that comes out.The motivation to make these posts is to share what essentially a ex-prop trader's perspective is. If you don't care about that, then that's completely fine! But if you're a noobie that's getting caught up in all the SPY 0-DTE gains and think that they have an edge, I hope I can share some aspect of trading that isn't just taking random 0-DTE shots and hoping for a 100x. I'm trying to hopefully educate people that trading isn't gambling, and there are actual opportunities out there if you keep an eye out for them.I've worked and traded with people that have made 6/7/8 figures. All of them use watchlists, and we share them. To not use one is to hamstring yourself in trading.",1,0.527,NEGATIVE,0.901

Was there anything in particular that made you add Gamestop to your watch list the last week?

It's aggravating when people want things spoon-fed to them- if I did that then I'd just sell trading signals (which I am morally against doing because I think they're bogus). If I said ""Buy GME calls for $20 expiring this week"" and people lost money I wouldn't be able to stand myself.Here's a chart of GME for the past 3 months: https://imgur.com/a/HNYCv3FI initially added it to the watchlist because of that huge move on Friday.Look at those spikes for the past 4 days- we see volatility (usually 20-30% in a single day!), and each time we barely touch above $17 and move back to around $16. That's why I thought it was worth watching when it reached $17- maybe this time is different and we actually keep the run up, which we ended up doing today.Can't say whether we run or not tomorrow. I have to see how it trades in the moment before thinking about that.",3,0.528,NEGATIVE,1.0

Trading is about figuring out which style suits you best and building a strategy around that. If anyone has done the actual work to build a strategy and adhere to it, they won’t just blatantly use the stocks from this watchlist, they will have their own watchlists. So no idea what your motivation is behind this post. You say I don’t want to spoon feed anyone, yet you are hoping people will use these stocks to trade with their own strategies?
