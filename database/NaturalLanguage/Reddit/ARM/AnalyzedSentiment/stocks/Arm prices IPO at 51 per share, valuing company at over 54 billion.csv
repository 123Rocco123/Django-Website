You probably have a dozen ARM products within arms reach of you. They’re a soft IP semi-conductor company that has been around for years and sold more processors than AMD and Intel combined. They’re generally the low end processors (power your car, fridge, etc) but can also do high end stuff (your internet connection likely runs on ARM and there’s a movement for ARM cloud servers that’s been around for years). I’ve been wanting to invest in them for years. Not sure about this IPO though. It appears to be a 10% offering with large customers signing up. ARM is fundamental to a big ecosystem and when they were last acquired that caused some big waves. China is trying to stand up an alternative, and will likely be successful in China, but unsuccessful in Western adoption given the recent sanctions. This is likely about large customers securing small voting blocks of shares with a critical supplier to de-risk. They will buy and hold, making this a “low float semi-conductor offering”. It will likely be a wild ride.",3,0.538,0.738,POSITIVE
