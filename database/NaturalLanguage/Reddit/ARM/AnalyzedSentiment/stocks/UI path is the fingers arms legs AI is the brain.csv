,"Is this a fair analogy. AI on its own, can't really do much it needs to have something to control to manipulate or act. I saw UIPATH said this, and another doomsayer claiming that if AI gets a hold of RPA it will be able to start interacting in the real world. Thoughts on this? Seems like we are going down uncharted waters but UIpath might be a critical piece in the AI world?","I hope so UiPath is a top 5 biggest individual stock holding for me. That being said I’m watching the earnings very carefully because in the world of SaaS and AI we don’t necessarily know what is actually going to be useful. It could very well be that AI in the future can just automate things without the need for any RPA plug ins or ChatGPT and other LLMs can just design their own automation and incorporate it in their model. I’m personally bullish on the company but we are in uncharted waters. Also where you said “AI on its own, can’t really do much it needs to have something to control to manipulate or act.” This sounds like you’re almost quoting one of the CEOs from the last earnings call. Take anything management says with grain of salt. Earnings calls aren’t that different from sales pitches.",0,0.575,0.999,NEGATIVE

Now, when I say ""self-serve"" it isn't the business doing the ""coding"" but UIPath consultants...they often still rely on IT but ""less"" than they otherwise would (note: I'm on of those IT guys with a huge backlog). When the business has the money and want to write a check, they are often a viable choice...especially in an IT environment with dozens of systems and not enough development capacity for them all.",0,0.538,0.52,POSITIVE

Ergo they are part of the brain too. maybe a tiny part, who knows.How is UIpath critical, and why couldn't I end-to-end train an LLM to control a robot arm?",0,0.553,0.944,NEGATIVE

You can plug in different OCR and AI engine’s. Though they have proprietary solutions the value is they’re agnostic to a point. I want to say their core competencies are document processing, screen scraping, scripting type activities. I feel like the demand for that will only go up. What a lot of people aren’t getting about AI is there are going to be a lot more narrow use cases that won’t use LLMs. companies will look to reduce head count through easy implementation that won’t involve super expensive, and regulatory problematic models. That seems to be their addressable market.",0,0.526,0.93,POSITIVE

Others use machine learning - which is really just logistic regression operationalised - and call it AI. So you could use that analogy, but in reality AI is getting harder and harder to define as a specific thing, and more a fluffy idea.",0,0.536,0.698,POSITIVE
