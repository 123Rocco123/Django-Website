,"Nvidia is set to report third-quarter earnings results after the market closes on Wednesday. With shares hovering around record highs, it will take a blockbuster report to move the needle for investors. Nvidia stock rose 0.6% to $302.03 in Tuesday trading. Shares surged earlier this month as investors bought in on hype surrounding Nvidia’s financial prospects amid billions in investment, most notably from Facebook ‘s newly rebranded parent Meta Platforms (FB), to build a theorized next phase of the internet called the metaverse. Not even renewed scrutiny in the U.K. related to its proposed acquisition of chip designer Arm could stop the graphics card stock’s 131% year-to-date run. For the third quarter, analysts polled by FactSet forecast adjusted earnings of $1.11 a share and sales of $6.82 billion. The earnings report or outlook may need to be a blowout for the stock to continue rising. Though 34 of the 43 analysts listed by FactSet have Buy or equivalent ratings, the stock’s mean price target is $280.70. Bullish analysts will either need to raise their targets or downgrade the stock if shares hold above their targets. https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/nvidia-stock-earnings-preview-51637101805?mod=mw_latestnews",IF SPY and QQQ keeps doing 0.40 and 0.60 every day respectively i think NVDA can keep going on a mediocre report,0,0.525,1.0,NEGATIVE

If you’re expecting volatility it’s a great way to make money on both the move up and down. A week of flat trading 8% below ath for a company like Nvda heading into earnings right after they had a big run up means the rest of the market is just as hesitant as you. Just think what it would take for it to actually go down at this point. Only an earnings miss and/or reduced guidance. If you think either of those things are likely you shouldn’t have been in Nvda for the month leading up to earnings anyway. Personally I think they’ll beat and raise guidance based on how things look for the business. Which would cause the stock to make new all time highs.,4,0.565,1.0,NEGATIVE

Revenue and eps are the most standard. But even amzn doesn’t do guidance for eps for example and prefers net profits or something. It’s just another term for their own forecasts on what they think will happen through the next quarter. Not providing guidance at all due to uncertainty when the company usually provides is usually seen as a red flag as well and would cause a sell off.Chip shortage is being priced in at this point for all companies that would be affected. All the analysts can calculate how many the big players would be getting and what their specific impact would be based on the figures that are already circulating from the companies who’ve reported their impact and then comparing the prioritization and contracts with the makers and all of the relevant companies they sell to. Nvda wouldn’t have gotten the Morgan Stanley upgrade a couple weeks ago if their analyst was calculating a chip shortage concern impacting them.",6,0.551,1.0,NEGATIVE
