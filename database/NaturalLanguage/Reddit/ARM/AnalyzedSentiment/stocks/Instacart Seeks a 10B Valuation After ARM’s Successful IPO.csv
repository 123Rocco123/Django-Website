,"https://tokenist.com/instacart-seeks-a-10b-valuation-after-arms-successful-ipo-report/ Instacart is reportedly planning to increase its IPO target price range to $28–$30 per share, potentially valuing the company at nearly $10 billion. This comes in the wake of chipmaker Arm's successful IPO, which rejuvenated investor optimism in new listings. Arm's share price jumped over 25% on its debut day, elevating its market cap to around $65 billion and sparking a renewed interest in the startup and IPO market. While the revised IPO target for Instacart is significant, it's worth noting that this is still a reduction from the company's $39 billion valuation in 2021. The grocery delivery giant, which has secured over $2 billion in venture capital across more than 19 rounds, appears to be strategically capitalizing on the current uplift in market sentiment.

This comes in the wake of chipmaker Arm's successful IPO, which rejuvenated investor optimism in new listings. Arm's share price jumped over 25% on its debut day, elevating its market cap to around $65 billion and sparking a renewed interest in the startup and IPO market. While the revised IPO target for Instacart is significant, it's worth noting that this is still a reduction from the company's $39 billion valuation in 2021. The grocery delivery giant, which has secured over $2 billion in venture capital across more than 19 rounds, appears to be strategically capitalizing on the current uplift in market sentiment. The move indicates a cautious but optimistic approach, balancing market trends with Instacart's own financial history and goals.",I used to do Instacart - I still can. They treat shoppers like shit.
