,"The fertilizer industry has been unattractive since 2013 when the Belarusian Potash cartel broke apart. Back in 2006-2012, investors used to gush over fertilizer companies. Potash, phosphate and nitrogen increase crop yields for growing populations and production is in the hands of a few producers. BHP tried to buy Potash Corp of Saskatchewan in 2010 but the Canadian government blocked it b/c the potash mines were too strategically important. The war in Ukraine is disrupting not only agricultural production, but also essential fertilizers in a major way. Belarus and Russia account for 1/3 of global potash production which face sanctions and export logistics challenges due to the war. Norwegian nitrogen producer Yara Int'l had to curtail nitrogen b/c European natural gas shortages. Natural gas is the key input to make nitrogen fertilizer. China is a large phosphate producer and they halted exports last fall. Farmers are beginning to plant their crops this spring and there's not enough fertilizer to go around. Crop yields are inevitably going to be lower and ag prices are headed higher. This is a problem for the world. Nutrien (NYSE: NTR): 7.9x P/E (2022e EPS). Consensus EPS is $14.18/share for 2022. Free cash flow (Operating cash flow - capex) for 2022 is $7.2B, making for FCF yield of 10.0%. Mosaic (NYSE: MOS): 6.5x P/E (2022e EPS). Consensus EPS is $11.72/share for 2022. FCF yield is also 10.0%. CF Industries (NYSE: CF): 6.7x P/E (2022e EPS). Consensus EPS is $10.77/share for 2022. FCF yield of 13.3% These are very low valuations and its real free cash flow being produced. Their competition is either facing sanctions, cannot get feedstock, is much smaller or is higher cost. K+S (KPLUY) is a German producer and Intrepid Potash (IPI) are also in this business but are second tier b/c of higher costs. Nutrien is the largest, most diversified fertilizer producer. It's Potash Corp of Saskatchewan and Agrium, which make up 2/3 of the Canadian potash cartel, ""Canpotex"". Nutrien also does nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer. They also have a retail distribution arm so its vertically integrated. Like OPEC and oil, Canpotex holds back production to keep prices higher but they will open higher cost mines to increase potash production. Mosaic (NYSE: MOS) is the other 1/3 of Canpotex and is a major potash producer with its Esterhazy, Saskatchewan mine, the largest in the world. They also have a very good phosphate mining business in Florida. CF Industries (NYSE: CF) is only a nitrogen fertilizer producer, but is the largest in the western world. Nitrogen is made from natural gas, so being in the United States they have low cost access to cheap, abundant natural gas so they are very well positioned on the global cost curve. These stocks have rallied a lot recently, but (1) they trade at very cheap multiples and (2) their businesses have faced headwinds since 2013, primarily due to increasing supply which has unequivocally changed. A lot of that supply has been drastically impacted by war. If you think the war ends next month and all is forgiven with sanctions dropped, these may not be the stocks for you. If you're worried about the war and food inflation, you should consider these.

Starting last spring, chicken manure is no longer available at either the big boxes or the local garden stores (Las Vegas). Also, I've noticed that steer manure prices have been increasing at 20% per year over the past 2-3 years.I spotted MOS recently, and as I researched a bit, I found that fertilizer prices have been rising so rapidly that farmers have returned to spreading manure instead of using commercial fertilizers. From what I've read, this is not a situation that will resolve itself in the near term, and is a large part of the cause of the retail manure shortage.Without making a prediction, I can't help but think that this situation will keep exerting an upward pressure on the price of MOS et al.Personally, given all that's being produced in D.C., I never thought this country would ever see a shortage of bullshit or chickenshit.",0,0.522,0.999,NEGATIVE

Commercial chicken manures are composted before packaging and sale and it doesn't seem to be a problem in my amended soils. Also, I live in Vegas with highly alkaline soils, so the most that acidification will do is bring them down to neutral. Finally, many veggies and berries prefer acidic soil.Even on a retail level, commercial fertilizers are more expensive than manure, and in many cases the increased production is not offset by the added expense unless you're growing a crop like cannabis. Given what I've read about commercial farming, the margins for non-mega-agri-corp farms are razor thin (at least in the U.S.), which certainly helps explain this shit shortage.The questions I'd like answered are whether the higher prices are being caused by higher demand or higher costs, and whether the overall loss in sales to struggling farms is made up for by increased margins on more expensive products in the overall market.",2,0.528,0.999,NEGATIVE

If Nutrien and Mosaic had the same share count as NPK they would be ~$1400/share and ~$480/share. I say this only as a reminder to not forget how little Verde has diluted their share count. Nutrien is increasing their production from 14million tonnes to 15 million tonnes this year. Verde is expanding to 13 million tonnes in 2023.As Brazil has routinely been experiencing import issues with potassium Brazilian states are competing for Verde's 3rd plant.""According to the founder of Verde Agritech, Cristiano Veloso, adding the capacity of the three units, the company will have enough potash production to supply 16.4% of national demand from 2024.“We are doing studies and choosing locations. Some other states of the federation, in addition to Minas Gerais, are interested in taking the factory and we are evaluating where it will be. Of course, as a good miner, we want him to stay in Minas and we believe he has everything to stay. But, due to the fertilizer crisis, other states are very committed to being able to take the factory”, he highlights.Also according to Veloso, the state where the plant is built will be able to be 100% independent of imported potassium. “Therefore, there is great interest from different agricultural states in relation to the new unit. The government of Minas has made an effort to get the third plant here ,” he said."" https://diariodocomercio.com.br/agronegocio/minas-pode-abrigar-nova-planta-de-fertilizantes/This is all excellent news and opportunity.13000K tonnes production in 2024 with $100 margin would be +$20/share.

The Germany-based group is also benefiting from high energy prices in the generally good agar environment, analyst Chetan Udeshi wrote in a study published on Friday. He therefore raised his investment recommendation by two notches from ""Underweight"" to ""Overweight"" despite the share price having already doubled this year and increased the price target from 12.50 to 44.50 euros. Udeshi thus sees further upside potential of around 40 percent.The environment for Europe's fertilizer producers in 2022 and possibly also in 2023 is very positive. Potash prices should now remain high in the longer term, he wrote, referring to Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and the sanctions imposed as a result. In doing so, he also recalled the sanctions already imposed on Belarus earlier. Both countries have accounted for large volumes of global production of potash, ammonia and urea. In addition, high global energy prices are likely to support high nitrogen prices.The JPMorgan analyst raised his price estimates for fertilizers significantly and thus also his forecasts for the operating earnings of K+S, Yara and OCI . For 2023, for example, he is now up to 50 percent above the current Bloomberg consensus. Cash generation will also be correspondingly strong, Udeshi expects, and anticipates a cash return of more than 10 percent.In the long term, Udeshi's favorite remains the Dutch OCI, now followed by K+S, despite lower share price potential of currently around 25 percent. The expert believes that Norwegian fertilizer producer Yara will post very good results in view of the first-quarter figures expected on April 27, but is less optimistic about the stock overall with a ""neutral"" rating.",0,0.555,0.929,NEGATIVE

Norwegian nitrogen producer Yara Int'l had to curtail nitrogen b/c European natural gas shortages. Natural gas is the key input to make nitrogen fertilizer.

FCF yield of 13.3% These are very low valuations and its real free cash flow being produced. Their competition is either facing sanctions, cannot get feedstock, is much smaller or is higher cost. K+S (KPLUY) is a German producer and Intrepid Potash (IPI) are also in this business but are second tier b/c of higher costs. Nutrien is the largest, most diversified fertilizer producer. It's Potash Corp of Saskatchewan and Agrium, which make up 2/3 of the Canadian potash cartel, ""Canpotex"". Nutrien also does nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer. They also have a retail distribution arm so its vertically integrated. Like OPEC and oil, Canpotex holds back production to keep prices higher but they will open higher cost mines to increase potash production. Mosaic (NYSE: MOS) is the other 1/3 of Canpotex and is a major potash producer with its Esterhazy, Saskatchewan mine, the largest in the world. They also have a very good phosphate mining business in Florida. CF Industries (NYSE: CF) is only a nitrogen fertilizer producer, but is the largest in the western world. Nitrogen is made from natural gas, so being in the United States they have low cost access to cheap, abundant natural gas so they are very well positioned on the global cost curve. These stocks have rallied a lot recently, but (1) they trade at very cheap multiples and (2) their businesses have faced headwinds since 2013, primarily due to increasing supply which has unequivocally changed. A lot of that supply has been drastically impacted by war. If you think the war ends next month and all is forgiven with sanctions dropped, these may not be the stocks for you. If you're worried about the war and food inflation, you should consider these. Good luck.",I’ve been long mos for a minute here and pleased,0,0.537,0.994,POSITIVE
