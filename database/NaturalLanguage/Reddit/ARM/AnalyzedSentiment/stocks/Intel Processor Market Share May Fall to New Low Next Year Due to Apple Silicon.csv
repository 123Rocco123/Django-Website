I've heard way too many bad things about them from my very tech savvy co-workers who much prefer AMD & ARM processors. Their judgement has proven to be very accurate on this subject in the past (I would have made a boatload of money if I had bought into AMD when they started obsessing over it).",1,0.547,1.0,NEGATIVE

This isn't a high horse thing. Anyways,Intel's architecture is built to excel at single thread handling. While AMD has significantly improved their single thread performance over the years, Intel still leads on IPC (Instructions per clock).Now, the really important part. Intel leads on IPC in regards to power consumption. Intel does not use as much power. This is why (1) most current game engines are optimized for Intel and (2) most datacenters use servers with Intel CPUs.It's also really interesting to see the Apple MI architecture showing up. Up until recently, the industry built almost entirely around Intel, AMD, and ARM; so we'll see.AMD has focused primarily on multi-thread processing and have excelled heavily at it for quite a while (going as far back as the Athlon series). More recently, AMD has been focusing on the ""all around consumer CPU."" Ever since they moved to 7nm, they are coming very close to Intel on single thread as well.AMD uses a lot more power and it turn, runs hotter. While AMD kicks ass at multi-core, the power consumption is not ideal for datacenters since 99% of servers work in the business world are single thread processes. However, AMD excels in the consumer market for things like video editing and gaming+streaming. While Intel can definitely do the job, AMD is winning in that world.On top of this, AMD has had a stellar PR run these last few years.The interesting thing is that AMD TSMC 7nm is almost the same size as Intel 14nm +++, at least for node size, gate length, and half- pitch. But the big difference is transistor density. Intel 10 nm and TSMC 7nm processes both produce dies with approx 90 million transistors per sq millimetre and at 150MT/mm² for 7nm and 5nm (Intel's next flagship series is going to be 5nm).The next aspect is consistency. I can send you a couple of very lengthy, detailed videos showing this (if you'd like). Intel wins at consistency. What I mean by that is, when Intel says ""this processor gives you 2.8GHz,"" it will, almost always, be 2.8GHz. We're talking 99.95%.In AMD's case, that same statement is more around 96-97% of the time. While that number doesn't seem like a big difference, consistency is everything. AMD processors have been shown to downclock by estimated usage. Is that damaging? No. But, consistency is very important. HOWEVEROverclocking. AMDs deficit of consistency is also one of its greatest strengths. AMD has insane overclock opportunity and those unlocked cores are fantastic.My point here is that neither AMD or Intel is better than the other, overall. They are better at different things. You want consistent, cooler, single thread power? Intel. You want a multi-thread, hotter, beast of a machine? AMD. Are you a business owner looking to host your company servers? Intel. You game and stream? AMD.Heck, ARM architecture kicks AMD and Intel to the floor in some use cases too.It's all about use case. If anyone touts one over the other, they haven't done their research. They're both great, at different things.Edited: misspelled",4,0.553,0.992,POSITIVE

Apple is still a great company to invest in however! the big hurdle is still porting programs designed on x86 to ARM, many programs do support ARM but nowhere near enough yet to really start hurting intel.Intels main revenue source is datacenter and enterprise low volume but crazy profits. datacenter is always intels and AMDs primary focus, next is client computing, this is your computer, the chip that is still in your pc and laptop unless you have an M1 based apple product. theres more volume here, less profit but still again a lot of profit to be made. most of their total revenue is from this sector.what market does apples M1 chip currently cater for? its highly specific, their own products, and most of which is going against what intel consideres their client computing group. now its possible the M1 chip could do datacenter tasks, it does have ECC support however there's no memory modules in LPDDR4 that support ECC making the product totally useless for enterprise until then.not only that i suspect apple had an exceptionally good deal with intel for their chips, its very common for intel to provide hefty bulk order discounts to system integrators because in reality, but the silicon itself is also cheap the R&D is expensive. in reality, its not just apple they should be worried about, its ARM in general. is apple with the M1 chip is accelerating the transition to ARM away from x86? absolutly, but i dont think apple will be the one to capitalise on that because they like to keep their products to themselves, but once that transition has occurred, any arm compiled program would run on any arm chip (assuming its compiled for that OS) which is the bigger cause for concernthen you have AMD, who they should actually be significantly more worried about because they directly compete with each other in the same markets, and currently, AMD is absolutely on an R&D rocket. AMD is not just staying at 10% they are not staying still for intel, Zen4 from rumours sounds like it will compete against Alder lake just fine and when the move to DDR5 for consumers seems like it will be cost-prohibitive or totally non-existant by the time Alder Lake releases, which also needs significant scheduler changes in windows to be supported due to the introduction of x86 ""big.little""apple is still only 6% of computer sales globally. unless they start taking more of that pie, the loss to intel is honestly quite minor in relation to their size and overall profits.",0,0.54,1.0,NEGATIVE
