,"TLDR: in 2040, US will have 20-23% of entire population as retirees, meaning that they can't go back to job markets simply because index funds are 30% down, nor can they go to mass suicide events while they have to make end meets. The best course of an action is to make index go upper right through fed's intervention and government's policy. Everyone will be happy except a few gruntling soul that keeps complaining that everything is over-valued. I read u/waxMyRear's post on THE STOCK MARKET WILL ALWAYS REBOUND AND STAY ""OVERVALUED"" SO LONG AS NO OTHER INVESTMENT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO NON-BOOMER GENERATIONS The great discussion has been made, but I wanted to add another fundamental side of background: US demographic. Common sense should tell everyone that in 1950-1960, the average life span used to be 60-70, but due to modern biological revolution, the average life span in 2020 is about early 80s in USA. Sure, COVID19 perhaps helped to reduce the life span, still the average life span is expected to be early 80s in USA. So in 1950-1960, the retiree would be 5-10 years to make end meets, but in today's world, the retirees will have to live on another 20-30 years, and as you know, living is not easy thing to do, espeically when you want to make your dignity and financial needs are met So let's just think about it. Those who are set to retire between 61-65 are gonna have to make end meets to survive on when medical bills are supposed to be higher/paying kids tuitions/and living expenses on college campus. Sure, government aids such as Medicare and Social Security are there to help for one reason, but everyone knows those are not enough to live comfortably. The retirees can't simply go back to employment markets and compete with age groups over 30/40 just because their portfolio is -30% down over night. Physically, intellectually, and bodily, they simply can't compete, meaning that their primary capability of income is little to nothing, but yet, the social expectation is that it's time for those age group over 65 to call it a day and go home, playing with grandkids or video games when they still have so many bills to pay. Sure, in unusual exceptional cases such as doctor/businessmen/women/lawyers may still choose to continue work or have access to go back to employment market, should it be better suited for the financial needs, but 95% of population in the age group dont have such a privilege to go back to employment markets. Sure, they can, maybe, work in HD/WMT as part of courtesy group, but still the issue remains that the paycheck is too small to make end meets. And for the records, employers are doing their best to replace human workforces as much as possible so they would be more than happy to let employees in 30s go, when they find robotic arms to flip burgers, so why would they even bother to consider to hire 60s? As a result, the only viable option to make end meets successfully for the retirees is to have money set in the markets. Whether it's TSLA/NVDA or SPY/QQQ or bond markets, investing is the only way within legally allowable means unless one's so genius enough that your financial success can be made. After all, that's how capitalists work out: No need to do physical work, but just sit and play the markets (whether it's time the market or time in the market). And as you know, it's emotionally distressing jobs, when you buy the equity only to find out it's dipping even more, and when you sell only to find out it's skyrocketing. At the end of days, you take the risk, and you either get reward or pay the price. Now, the conclusion is that Per 2020's Census, it's projected that by 2040, 22% of population will be age group over 65. In pure capitalism world, an investor will be held accountable for actions when they are losing the money. But in today's capitalistic world, an investor dont lose the money if it's index funds. That's the fundamental message that Fed sent out in 2008 Financial Crisis and 2020 in Covid19 crashes. Fed won't come to save you when your TSLA is 50% off, but they will come to save you when your SPY/QQQ index are 50% off. Whether it's QE or it's 0% interests or some other genius ways I dont even know, they have both moral and legal obligation to secure the nation and provide the bread at the end of days especially when someone's already retired and dont have primary source of income. It will be more costly if 20-30 % of US population will suffer from financial doom that would occur due to Fed's policy and government's intervention. At the end of days, government is there for a reason to protect its constituents and provide food/shelters regardless of their financial status. For the very this reason, I dont think that even if Fed see the inflation coming, they can really raises the interest rate to 20% in 1980s. My gut feeling is that 5% is max they can literally do and face the total purge of Fed board members either fired or replaced due to political leadership changes. Even with 5% key interest rates, this will bring total chaos to housing market that the retiree groups have as their primary source of assets. Can American voters be ready to see their 401K/IRA 30% red? This is absolutely unacceptable for anyone in any case if it's to occur during Republican time or Democrats time no matter how much they are die-hard partisan voters, not to mention that independent voters will simply flock to other party that just happen to be not in the WH's term. And if SPY/QQQ are 30% down, it means TSLA/NVDA are 40-50% down, and all those growth stocks are 80-90% down. Now some may point out that other countries like Japan/Euro zones dont have their index go upper right, which is absolutely true, and while I dont know everything in their social welfare, Japan/Euro zones, in general, have better social safety net than US. If this is not enough answer, then consider that USD is a key currency that US fed have unlimited authority to print out, if it's deemed to be the best interest of American Republic, not necessarily for the sake of the rest of the world. Whether it's Biden or Trump, the #1 is American First. When economy goes down, the best safe harbor investment destination is US dollar in treasury notes that's guaranteed while US is a leading country that have the best state of art companies in many areas and innovative technologies with cutting edge talents, so while the rest of the world suffer, it's perhaps the safest investment. So the index will be different than Japan/Euro zones. At the end of days, what Fed in 2008 and 2020 have shown is that America will never fail (until there is literally no other ways to avoid the failures, which I hope is not within our generation). So investing in US indexes is the same question that should read like ""Do you believe that within your life time, US will continue its success or face failure?"" My bet is that it will continue its success at least until my life time (early 30s). If the answer is yet, consider to to slowly buy SPY/QQQ in different months. If the answer is no, I am not too sure where to invest, but you would be on your own. Time will prove your choice, but even if not, at least, it's worth going to US index if you are investing for 10-20 years.",Remind me 50 years,0,0.535,0.999,POSITIVE

Whether it's TSLA/NVDA or SPY/QQQ or bond markets, investing is the only way within legally allowable means unless one's so genius enough that your financial success can be made. After all, that's how capitalists work out: No need to do physical work, but just sit and play the markets (whether it's time the market or time in the market). And as you know, it's emotionally distressing jobs, when you buy the equity only to find out it's dipping even more, and when you sell only to find out it's skyrocketing. At the end of days, you take the risk, and you either get reward or pay the price. Now, the conclusion is that Per 2020's Census, it's projected that by 2040, 22% of population will be age group over 65. In pure capitalism world, an investor will be held accountable for actions when they are losing the money. But in today's capitalistic world, an investor dont lose the money if it's index funds. That's the fundamental message that Fed sent out in 2008 Financial Crisis and 2020 in Covid19 crashes. Fed won't come to save you when your TSLA is 50% off, but they will come to save you when your SPY/QQQ index are 50% off. Whether it's QE or it's 0% interests or some other genius ways I dont even know, they have both moral and legal obligation to secure the nation and provide the bread at the end of days especially when someone's already retired and dont have primary source of income. It will be more costly if 20-30 % of US population will suffer from financial doom that would occur due to Fed's policy and government's intervention. At the end of days, government is there for a reason to protect its constituents and provide food/shelters regardless of their financial status. For the very this reason, I dont think that even if Fed see the inflation coming, they can really raises the interest rate to 20% in 1980s. My gut feeling is that 5% is max they can literally do and face the total purge of Fed board members either fired or replaced due to political leadership changes. Even with 5% key interest rates, this will bring total chaos to housing market that the retiree groups have as their primary source of assets. Can American voters be ready to see their 401K/IRA 30% red? This is absolutely unacceptable for anyone in any case if it's to occur during Republican time or Democrats time no matter how much they are die-hard partisan voters, not to mention that independent voters will simply flock to other party that just happen to be not in the WH's term. And if SPY/QQQ are 30% down, it means TSLA/NVDA are 40-50% down, and all those growth stocks are 80-90% down. Now some may point out that other countries like Japan/Euro zones dont have their index go upper right, which is absolutely true, and while I dont know everything in their social welfare, Japan/Euro zones, in general, have better social safety net than US. If this is not enough answer, then consider that USD is a key currency that US fed have unlimited authority to print out, if it's deemed to be the best interest of American Republic, not necessarily for the sake of the rest of the world. Whether it's Biden or Trump, the #1 is American First. When economy goes down, the best safe harbor investment destination is US dollar in treasury notes that's guaranteed while US is a leading country that have the best state of art companies in many areas and innovative technologies with cutting edge talents, so while the rest of the world suffer, it's perhaps the safest investment. So the index will be different than Japan/Euro zones. At the end of days, what Fed in 2008 and 2020 have shown is that America will never fail (until there is literally no other ways to avoid the failures, which I hope is not within our generation). So investing in US indexes is the same question that should read like ""Do you believe that within your life time, US will continue its success or face failure?"" My bet is that it will continue its success at least until my life time (early 30s). If the answer is yet, consider to to slowly buy SPY/QQQ in different months. If the answer is no, I am not too sure where to invest, but you would be on your own. Time will prove your choice, but even if not, at least, it's worth going to US index if you are investing for 10-20 years.",This is one of those zoomers who thinks the mass die off of Boomers will save their lives from the perpetual mediocrity they endure.,1,0.507,0.997,NEGATIVE
,"TLDR: in 2040, US will have 20-23% of entire population as retirees, meaning that they can't go back to job markets simply because index funds are 30% down, nor can they go to mass suicide events while they have to make end meets. The best course of an action is to make index go upper right through fed's intervention and government's policy. Everyone will be happy except a few gruntling soul that keeps complaining that everything is over-valued. I read u/waxMyRear's post on THE STOCK MARKET WILL ALWAYS REBOUND AND STAY ""OVERVALUED"" SO LONG AS NO OTHER INVESTMENT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO NON-BOOMER GENERATIONS The great discussion has been made, but I wanted to add another fundamental side of background: US demographic. Common sense should tell everyone that in 1950-1960, the average life span used to be 60-70, but due to modern biological revolution, the average life span in 2020 is about early 80s in USA. Sure, COVID19 perhaps helped to reduce the life span, still the average life span is expected to be early 80s in USA. So in 1950-1960, the retiree would be 5-10 years to make end meets, but in today's world, the retirees will have to live on another 20-30 years, and as you know, living is not easy thing to do, espeically when you want to make your dignity and financial needs are met So let's just think about it. Those who are set to retire between 61-65 are gonna have to make end meets to survive on when medical bills are supposed to be higher/paying kids tuitions/and living expenses on college campus. Sure, government aids such as Medicare and Social Security are there to help for one reason, but everyone knows those are not enough to live comfortably. The retirees can't simply go back to employment markets and compete with age groups over 30/40 just because their portfolio is -30% down over night. Physically, intellectually, and bodily, they simply can't compete, meaning that their primary capability of income is little to nothing, but yet, the social expectation is that it's time for those age group over 65 to call it a day and go home, playing with grandkids or video games when they still have so many bills to pay. Sure, in unusual exceptional cases such as doctor/businessmen/women/lawyers may still choose to continue work or have access to go back to employment market, should it be better suited for the financial needs, but 95% of population in the age group dont have such a privilege to go back to employment markets. Sure, they can, maybe, work in HD/WMT as part of courtesy group, but still the issue remains that the paycheck is too small to make end meets.

And if SPY/QQQ are 30% down, it means TSLA/NVDA are 40-50% down, and all those growth stocks are 80-90% down. Now some may point out that other countries like Japan/Euro zones dont have their index go upper right, which is absolutely true, and while I dont know everything in their social welfare, Japan/Euro zones, in general, have better social safety net than US. If this is not enough answer, then consider that USD is a key currency that US fed have unlimited authority to print out, if it's deemed to be the best interest of American Republic, not necessarily for the sake of the rest of the world. Whether it's Biden or Trump, the #1 is American First. When economy goes down, the best safe harbor investment destination is US dollar in treasury notes that's guaranteed while US is a leading country that have the best state of art companies in many areas and innovative technologies with cutting edge talents, so while the rest of the world suffer, it's perhaps the safest investment. So the index will be different than Japan/Euro zones. At the end of days, what Fed in 2008 and 2020 have shown is that America will never fail (until there is literally no other ways to avoid the failures, which I hope is not within our generation). So investing in US indexes is the same question that should read like ""Do you believe that within your life time, US will continue its success or face failure?"" My bet is that it will continue its success at least until my life time (early 30s). If the answer is yet, consider to to slowly buy SPY/QQQ in different months. If the answer is no, I am not too sure where to invest, but you would be on your own. Time will prove your choice, but even if not, at least, it's worth going to US index if you are investing for 10-20 years.","I know it's kind of extreme version, but parents who are afraid to be financial burden of their kids simply choose to go out and to get suicide for insurance money after disguising as true accident, if it works, it's even better, but even if it's not, it's still financially beneficial for their children. I personally never heard this story in real life, but in fiction.",2,0.513,0.997,POSITIVE
,"TLDR: in 2040, US will have 20-23% of entire population as retirees, meaning that they can't go back to job markets simply because index funds are 30% down, nor can they go to mass suicide events while they have to make end meets. The best course of an action is to make index go upper right through fed's intervention and government's policy. Everyone will be happy except a few gruntling soul that keeps complaining that everything is over-valued. I read u/waxMyRear's post on THE STOCK MARKET WILL ALWAYS REBOUND AND STAY ""OVERVALUED"" SO LONG AS NO OTHER INVESTMENT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO NON-BOOMER GENERATIONS The great discussion has been made, but I wanted to add another fundamental side of background: US demographic. Common sense should tell everyone that in 1950-1960, the average life span used to be 60-70, but due to modern biological revolution, the average life span in 2020 is about early 80s in USA. Sure, COVID19 perhaps helped to reduce the life span, still the average life span is expected to be early 80s in USA. So in 1950-1960, the retiree would be 5-10 years to make end meets, but in today's world, the retirees will have to live on another 20-30 years, and as you know, living is not easy thing to do, espeically when you want to make your dignity and financial needs are met So let's just think about it. Those who are set to retire between 61-65 are gonna have to make end meets to survive on when medical bills are supposed to be higher/paying kids tuitions/and living expenses on college campus. Sure, government aids such as Medicare and Social Security are there to help for one reason, but everyone knows those are not enough to live comfortably. The retirees can't simply go back to employment markets and compete with age groups over 30/40 just because their portfolio is -30% down over night. Physically, intellectually, and bodily, they simply can't compete, meaning that their primary capability of income is little to nothing, but yet, the social expectation is that it's time for those age group over 65 to call it a day and go home, playing with grandkids or video games when they still have so many bills to pay. Sure, in unusual exceptional cases such as doctor/businessmen/women/lawyers may still choose to continue work or have access to go back to employment market, should it be better suited for the financial needs, but 95% of population in the age group dont have such a privilege to go back to employment markets. Sure, they can, maybe, work in HD/WMT as part of courtesy group, but still the issue remains that the paycheck is too small to make end meets. And for the records, employers are doing their best to replace human workforces as much as possible so they would be more than happy to let employees in 30s go, when they find robotic arms to flip burgers, so why would they even bother to consider to hire 60s? As a result, the only viable option to make end meets successfully for the retirees is to have money set in the markets. Whether it's TSLA/NVDA or SPY/QQQ or bond markets, investing is the only way within legally allowable means unless one's so genius enough that your financial success can be made. After all, that's how capitalists work out: No need to do physical work, but just sit and play the markets (whether it's time the market or time in the market). And as you know, it's emotionally distressing jobs, when you buy the equity only to find out it's dipping even more, and when you sell only to find out it's skyrocketing. At the end of days, you take the risk, and you either get reward or pay the price. Now, the conclusion is that Per 2020's Census, it's projected that by 2040, 22% of population will be age group over 65. In pure capitalism world, an investor will be held accountable for actions when they are losing the money. But in today's capitalistic world, an investor dont lose the money if it's index funds. That's the fundamental message that Fed sent out in 2008 Financial Crisis and 2020 in Covid19 crashes. Fed won't come to save you when your TSLA is 50% off, but they will come to save you when your SPY/QQQ index are 50% off. Whether it's QE or it's 0% interests or some other genius ways I dont even know, they have both moral and legal obligation to secure the nation and provide the bread at the end of days especially when someone's already retired and dont have primary source of income. It will be more costly if 20-30 % of US population will suffer from financial doom that would occur due to Fed's policy and government's intervention. At the end of days, government is there for a reason to protect its constituents and provide food/shelters regardless of their financial status. For the very this reason, I dont think that even if Fed see the inflation coming, they can really raises the interest rate to 20% in 1980s. My gut feeling is that 5% is max they can literally do and face the total purge of Fed board members either fired or replaced due to political leadership changes. Even with 5% key interest rates, this will bring total chaos to housing market that the retiree groups have as their primary source of assets.

If the answer is no, I am not too sure where to invest, but you would be on your own.

,"TLDR: in 2040, US will have 20-23% of entire population as retirees, meaning that they can't go back to job markets simply because index funds are 30% down, nor can they go to mass suicide events while they have to make end meets. The best course of an action is to make index go upper right through fed's intervention and government's policy. Everyone will be happy except a few gruntling soul that keeps complaining that everything is over-valued. I read u/waxMyRear's post on THE STOCK MARKET WILL ALWAYS REBOUND AND STAY ""OVERVALUED"" SO LONG AS NO OTHER INVESTMENT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO NON-BOOMER GENERATIONS The great discussion has been made, but I wanted to add another fundamental side of background: US demographic. Common sense should tell everyone that in 1950-1960, the average life span used to be 60-70, but due to modern biological revolution, the average life span in 2020 is about early 80s in USA. Sure, COVID19 perhaps helped to reduce the life span, still the average life span is expected to be early 80s in USA. So in 1950-1960, the retiree would be 5-10 years to make end meets, but in today's world, the retirees will have to live on another 20-30 years, and as you know, living is not easy thing to do, espeically when you want to make your dignity and financial needs are met So let's just think about it. Those who are set to retire between 61-65 are gonna have to make end meets to survive on when medical bills are supposed to be higher/paying kids tuitions/and living expenses on college campus. Sure, government aids such as Medicare and Social Security are there to help for one reason, but everyone knows those are not enough to live comfortably. The retirees can't simply go back to employment markets and compete with age groups over 30/40 just because their portfolio is -30% down over night. Physically, intellectually, and bodily, they simply can't compete, meaning that their primary capability of income is little to nothing, but yet, the social expectation is that it's time for those age group over 65 to call it a day and go home, playing with grandkids or video games when they still have so many bills to pay. Sure, in unusual exceptional cases such as doctor/businessmen/women/lawyers may still choose to continue work or have access to go back to employment market, should it be better suited for the financial needs, but 95% of population in the age group dont have such a privilege to go back to employment markets. Sure, they can, maybe, work in HD/WMT as part of courtesy group, but still the issue remains that the paycheck is too small to make end meets. And for the records, employers are doing their best to replace human workforces as much as possible so they would be more than happy to let employees in 30s go, when they find robotic arms to flip burgers, so why would they even bother to consider to hire 60s? As a result, the only viable option to make end meets successfully for the retirees is to have money set in the markets. Whether it's TSLA/NVDA or SPY/QQQ or bond markets, investing is the only way within legally allowable means unless one's so genius enough that your financial success can be made. After all, that's how capitalists work out: No need to do physical work, but just sit and play the markets (whether it's time the market or time in the market). And as you know, it's emotionally distressing jobs, when you buy the equity only to find out it's dipping even more, and when you sell only to find out it's skyrocketing. At the end of days, you take the risk, and you either get reward or pay the price. Now, the conclusion is that Per 2020's Census, it's projected that by 2040, 22% of population will be age group over 65. In pure capitalism world, an investor will be held accountable for actions when they are losing the money. But in today's capitalistic world, an investor dont lose the money if it's index funds. That's the fundamental message that Fed sent out in 2008 Financial Crisis and 2020 in Covid19 crashes. Fed won't come to save you when your TSLA is 50% off, but they will come to save you when your SPY/QQQ index are 50% off. Whether it's QE or it's 0% interests or some other genius ways I dont even know, they have both moral and legal obligation to secure the nation and provide the bread at the end of days especially when someone's already retired and dont have primary source of income. It will be more costly if 20-30 % of US population will suffer from financial doom that would occur due to Fed's policy and government's intervention. At the end of days, government is there for a reason to protect its constituents and provide food/shelters regardless of their financial status. For the very this reason, I dont think that even if Fed see the inflation coming, they can really raises the interest rate to 20% in 1980s. My gut feeling is that 5% is max they can literally do and face the total purge of Fed board members either fired or replaced due to political leadership changes. Even with 5% key interest rates, this will bring total chaos to housing market that the retiree groups have as their primary source of assets. Can American voters be ready to see their 401K/IRA 30% red? This is absolutely unacceptable for anyone in any case if it's to occur during Republican time or Democrats time no matter how much they are die-hard partisan voters, not to mention that independent voters will simply flock to other party that just happen to be not in the WH's term. And if SPY/QQQ are 30% down, it means TSLA/NVDA are 40-50% down, and all those growth stocks are 80-90% down. Now some may point out that other countries like Japan/Euro zones dont have their index go upper right, which is absolutely true, and while I dont know everything in their social welfare, Japan/Euro zones, in general, have better social safety net than US. If this is not enough answer, then consider that USD is a key currency that US fed have unlimited authority to print out, if it's deemed to be the best interest of American Republic, not necessarily for the sake of the rest of the world. Whether it's Biden or Trump, the #1 is American First. When economy goes down, the best safe harbor investment destination is US dollar in treasury notes that's guaranteed while US is a leading country that have the best state of art companies in many areas and innovative technologies with cutting edge talents, so while the rest of the world suffer, it's perhaps the safest investment. So the index will be different than Japan/Euro zones. At the end of days, what Fed in 2008 and 2020 have shown is that America will never fail (until there is literally no other ways to avoid the failures, which I hope is not within our generation).

Common sense should tell everyone that in 1950-1960, the average life span used to be 60-70, but due to modern biological revolution, the average life span in 2020 is about early 80s in USA. Sure, COVID19 perhaps helped to reduce the life span, still the average life span is expected to be early 80s in USA. So in 1950-1960, the retiree would be 5-10 years to make end meets, but in today's world, the retirees will have to live on another 20-30 years, and as you know, living is not easy thing to do, espeically when you want to make your dignity and financial needs are met So let's just think about it. Those who are set to retire between 61-65 are gonna have to make end meets to survive on when medical bills are supposed to be higher/paying kids tuitions/and living expenses on college campus. Sure, government aids such as Medicare and Social Security are there to help for one reason, but everyone knows those are not enough to live comfortably. The retirees can't simply go back to employment markets and compete with age groups over 30/40 just because their portfolio is -30% down over night. Physically, intellectually, and bodily, they simply can't compete, meaning that their primary capability of income is little to nothing, but yet, the social expectation is that it's time for those age group over 65 to call it a day and go home, playing with grandkids or video games when they still have so many bills to pay. Sure, in unusual exceptional cases such as doctor/businessmen/women/lawyers may still choose to continue work or have access to go back to employment market, should it be better suited for the financial needs, but 95% of population in the age group dont have such a privilege to go back to employment markets. Sure, they can, maybe, work in HD/WMT as part of courtesy group, but still the issue remains that the paycheck is too small to make end meets. And for the records, employers are doing their best to replace human workforces as much as possible so they would be more than happy to let employees in 30s go, when they find robotic arms to flip burgers, so why would they even bother to consider to hire 60s? As a result, the only viable option to make end meets successfully for the retirees is to have money set in the markets. Whether it's TSLA/NVDA or SPY/QQQ or bond markets, investing is the only way within legally allowable means unless one's so genius enough that your financial success can be made. After all, that's how capitalists work out: No need to do physical work, but just sit and play the markets (whether it's time the market or time in the market). And as you know, it's emotionally distressing jobs, when you buy the equity only to find out it's dipping even more, and when you sell only to find out it's skyrocketing. At the end of days, you take the risk, and you either get reward or pay the price. Now, the conclusion is that Per 2020's Census, it's projected that by 2040, 22% of population will be age group over 65. In pure capitalism world, an investor will be held accountable for actions when they are losing the money. But in today's capitalistic world, an investor dont lose the money if it's index funds. That's the fundamental message that Fed sent out in 2008 Financial Crisis and 2020 in Covid19 crashes. Fed won't come to save you when your TSLA is 50% off, but they will come to save you when your SPY/QQQ index are 50% off. Whether it's QE or it's 0% interests or some other genius ways I dont even know, they have both moral and legal obligation to secure the nation and provide the bread at the end of days especially when someone's already retired and dont have primary source of income. It will be more costly if 20-30 % of US population will suffer from financial doom that would occur due to Fed's policy and government's intervention. At the end of days, government is there for a reason to protect its constituents and provide food/shelters regardless of their financial status. For the very this reason, I dont think that even if Fed see the inflation coming, they can really raises the interest rate to 20% in 1980s. My gut feeling is that 5% is max they can literally do and face the total purge of Fed board members either fired or replaced due to political leadership changes. Even with 5% key interest rates, this will bring total chaos to housing market that the retiree groups have as their primary source of assets. Can American voters be ready to see their 401K/IRA 30% red? This is absolutely unacceptable for anyone in any case if it's to occur during Republican time or Democrats time no matter how much they are die-hard partisan voters, not to mention that independent voters will simply flock to other party that just happen to be not in the WH's term. And if SPY/QQQ are 30% down, it means TSLA/NVDA are 40-50% down, and all those growth stocks are 80-90% down. Now some may point out that other countries like Japan/Euro zones dont have their index go upper right, which is absolutely true, and while I dont know everything in their social welfare, Japan/Euro zones, in general, have better social safety net than US. If this is not enough answer, then consider that USD is a key currency that US fed have unlimited authority to print out, if it's deemed to be the best interest of American Republic, not necessarily for the sake of the rest of the world. Whether it's Biden or Trump, the #1 is American First. When economy goes down, the best safe harbor investment destination is US dollar in treasury notes that's guaranteed while US is a leading country that have the best state of art companies in many areas and innovative technologies with cutting edge talents, so while the rest of the world suffer, it's perhaps the safest investment. So the index will be different than Japan/Euro zones. At the end of days, what Fed in 2008 and 2020 have shown is that America will never fail (until there is literally no other ways to avoid the failures, which I hope is not within our generation). So investing in US indexes is the same question that should read like ""Do you believe that within your life time, US will continue its success or face failure?"" My bet is that it will continue its success at least until my life time (early 30s). If the answer is yet, consider to to slowly buy SPY/QQQ in different months. If the answer is no, I am not too sure where to invest, but you would be on your own. Time will prove your choice, but even if not, at least, it's worth going to US index if you are investing for 10-20 years.","This is all to say, if America gets out of its own way and China stays in its own way…yeah.

,"TLDR: in 2040, US will have 20-23% of entire population as retirees, meaning that they can't go back to job markets simply because index funds are 30% down, nor can they go to mass suicide events while they have to make end meets.

Sure, they can, maybe, work in HD/WMT as part of courtesy group, but still the issue remains that the paycheck is too small to make end meets. And for the records, employers are doing their best to replace human workforces as much as possible so they would be more than happy to let employees in 30s go, when they find robotic arms to flip burgers, so why would they even bother to consider to hire 60s? As a result, the only viable option to make end meets successfully for the retirees is to have money set in the markets. Whether it's TSLA/NVDA or SPY/QQQ or bond markets, investing is the only way within legally allowable means unless one's so genius enough that your financial success can be made. After all, that's how capitalists work out: No need to do physical work, but just sit and play the markets (whether it's time the market or time in the market). And as you know, it's emotionally distressing jobs, when you buy the equity only to find out it's dipping even more, and when you sell only to find out it's skyrocketing. At the end of days, you take the risk, and you either get reward or pay the price. Now, the conclusion is that Per 2020's Census, it's projected that by 2040, 22% of population will be age group over 65. In pure capitalism world, an investor will be held accountable for actions when they are losing the money. But in today's capitalistic world, an investor dont lose the money if it's index funds. That's the fundamental message that Fed sent out in 2008 Financial Crisis and 2020 in Covid19 crashes. Fed won't come to save you when your TSLA is 50% off, but they will come to save you when your SPY/QQQ index are 50% off. Whether it's QE or it's 0% interests or some other genius ways I dont even know, they have both moral and legal obligation to secure the nation and provide the bread at the end of days especially when someone's already retired and dont have primary source of income. It will be more costly if 20-30 % of US population will suffer from financial doom that would occur due to Fed's policy and government's intervention. At the end of days, government is there for a reason to protect its constituents and provide food/shelters regardless of their financial status. For the very this reason, I dont think that even if Fed see the inflation coming, they can really raises the interest rate to 20% in 1980s. My gut feeling is that 5% is max they can literally do and face the total purge of Fed board members either fired or replaced due to political leadership changes. Even with 5% key interest rates, this will bring total chaos to housing market that the retiree groups have as their primary source of assets. Can American voters be ready to see their 401K/IRA 30% red? This is absolutely unacceptable for anyone in any case if it's to occur during Republican time or Democrats time no matter how much they are die-hard partisan voters, not to mention that independent voters will simply flock to other party that just happen to be not in the WH's term. And if SPY/QQQ are 30% down, it means TSLA/NVDA are 40-50% down, and all those growth stocks are 80-90% down. Now some may point out that other countries like Japan/Euro zones dont have their index go upper right, which is absolutely true, and while I dont know everything in their social welfare, Japan/Euro zones, in general, have better social safety net than US. If this is not enough answer, then consider that USD is a key currency that US fed have unlimited authority to print out, if it's deemed to be the best interest of American Republic, not necessarily for the sake of the rest of the world. Whether it's Biden or Trump, the #1 is American First. When economy goes down, the best safe harbor investment destination is US dollar in treasury notes that's guaranteed while US is a leading country that have the best state of art companies in many areas and innovative technologies with cutting edge talents, so while the rest of the world suffer, it's perhaps the safest investment. So the index will be different than Japan/Euro zones. At the end of days, what Fed in 2008 and 2020 have shown is that America will never fail (until there is literally no other ways to avoid the failures, which I hope is not within our generation). So investing in US indexes is the same question that should read like ""Do you believe that within your life time, US will continue its success or face failure?"" My bet is that it will continue its success at least until my life time (early 30s). If the answer is yet, consider to to slowly buy SPY/QQQ in different months. If the answer is no, I am not too sure where to invest, but you would be on your own. Time will prove your choice, but even if not, at least, it's worth going to US index if you are investing for 10-20 years.",Didn't know brother banging for a visa made you a terrorist...boebert and (especially) Greene are the AOC/Cory Bush of the right.. both sides are clownshows and embarrassments.,3,0.507,0.997,NEGATIVE
,"TLDR: in 2040, US will have 20-23% of entire population as retirees, meaning that they can't go back to job markets simply because index funds are 30% down, nor can they go to mass suicide events while they have to make end meets. The best course of an action is to make index go upper right through fed's intervention and government's policy.

I read u/waxMyRear's post on THE STOCK MARKET WILL ALWAYS REBOUND AND STAY ""OVERVALUED"" SO LONG AS NO OTHER INVESTMENT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO NON-BOOMER GENERATIONS The great discussion has been made, but I wanted to add another fundamental side of background: US demographic. Common sense should tell everyone that in 1950-1960, the average life span used to be 60-70, but due to modern biological revolution, the average life span in 2020 is about early 80s in USA. Sure, COVID19 perhaps helped to reduce the life span, still the average life span is expected to be early 80s in USA. So in 1950-1960, the retiree would be 5-10 years to make end meets, but in today's world, the retirees will have to live on another 20-30 years, and as you know, living is not easy thing to do, espeically when you want to make your dignity and financial needs are met So let's just think about it. Those who are set to retire between 61-65 are gonna have to make end meets to survive on when medical bills are supposed to be higher/paying kids tuitions/and living expenses on college campus. Sure, government aids such as Medicare and Social Security are there to help for one reason, but everyone knows those are not enough to live comfortably.

It will be more costly if 20-30 % of US population will suffer from financial doom that would occur due to Fed's policy and government's intervention. At the end of days, government is there for a reason to protect its constituents and provide food/shelters regardless of their financial status. For the very this reason, I dont think that even if Fed see the inflation coming, they can really raises the interest rate to 20% in 1980s. My gut feeling is that 5% is max they can literally do and face the total purge of Fed board members either fired or replaced due to political leadership changes. Even with 5% key interest rates, this will bring total chaos to housing market that the retiree groups have as their primary source of assets. Can American voters be ready to see their 401K/IRA 30% red? This is absolutely unacceptable for anyone in any case if it's to occur during Republican time or Democrats time no matter how much they are die-hard partisan voters, not to mention that independent voters will simply flock to other party that just happen to be not in the WH's term. And if SPY/QQQ are 30% down, it means TSLA/NVDA are 40-50% down, and all those growth stocks are 80-90% down. Now some may point out that other countries like Japan/Euro zones dont have their index go upper right, which is absolutely true, and while I dont know everything in their social welfare, Japan/Euro zones, in general, have better social safety net than US. If this is not enough answer, then consider that USD is a key currency that US fed have unlimited authority to print out, if it's deemed to be the best interest of American Republic, not necessarily for the sake of the rest of the world. Whether it's Biden or Trump, the #1 is American First. When economy goes down, the best safe harbor investment destination is US dollar in treasury notes that's guaranteed while US is a leading country that have the best state of art companies in many areas and innovative technologies with cutting edge talents, so while the rest of the world suffer, it's perhaps the safest investment. So the index will be different than Japan/Euro zones. At the end of days, what Fed in 2008 and 2020 have shown is that America will never fail (until there is literally no other ways to avoid the failures, which I hope is not within our generation). So investing in US indexes is the same question that should read like ""Do you believe that within your life time, US will continue its success or face failure?"" My bet is that it will continue its success at least until my life time (early 30s). If the answer is yet, consider to to slowly buy SPY/QQQ in different months. If the answer is no, I am not too sure where to invest, but you would be on your own. Time will prove your choice, but even if not, at least, it's worth going to US index if you are investing for 10-20 years.",How about you stop checking 4Chan for you political news and other people telling you how to think and feel about a certain issue…and provide a credible source telling me I’m wrong.Stop being a broke puppet.,6,0.508,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"TLDR: in 2040, US will have 20-23% of entire population as retirees, meaning that they can't go back to job markets simply because index funds are 30% down, nor can they go to mass suicide events while they have to make end meets. The best course of an action is to make index go upper right through fed's intervention and government's policy. Everyone will be happy except a few gruntling soul that keeps complaining that everything is over-valued. I read u/waxMyRear's post on THE STOCK MARKET WILL ALWAYS REBOUND AND STAY ""OVERVALUED"" SO LONG AS NO OTHER INVESTMENT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO NON-BOOMER GENERATIONS The great discussion has been made, but I wanted to add another fundamental side of background: US demographic. Common sense should tell everyone that in 1950-1960, the average life span used to be 60-70, but due to modern biological revolution, the average life span in 2020 is about early 80s in USA. Sure, COVID19 perhaps helped to reduce the life span, still the average life span is expected to be early 80s in USA. So in 1950-1960, the retiree would be 5-10 years to make end meets, but in today's world, the retirees will have to live on another 20-30 years, and as you know, living is not easy thing to do, espeically when you want to make your dignity and financial needs are met So let's just think about it. Those who are set to retire between 61-65 are gonna have to make end meets to survive on when medical bills are supposed to be higher/paying kids tuitions/and living expenses on college campus. Sure, government aids such as Medicare and Social Security are there to help for one reason, but everyone knows those are not enough to live comfortably. The retirees can't simply go back to employment markets and compete with age groups over 30/40 just because their portfolio is -30% down over night. Physically, intellectually, and bodily, they simply can't compete, meaning that their primary capability of income is little to nothing, but yet, the social expectation is that it's time for those age group over 65 to call it a day and go home, playing with grandkids or video games when they still have so many bills to pay. Sure, in unusual exceptional cases such as doctor/businessmen/women/lawyers may still choose to continue work or have access to go back to employment market, should it be better suited for the financial needs, but 95% of population in the age group dont have such a privilege to go back to employment markets. Sure, they can, maybe, work in HD/WMT as part of courtesy group, but still the issue remains that the paycheck is too small to make end meets. And for the records, employers are doing their best to replace human workforces as much as possible so they would be more than happy to let employees in 30s go, when they find robotic arms to flip burgers, so why would they even bother to consider to hire 60s? As a result, the only viable option to make end meets successfully for the retirees is to have money set in the markets. Whether it's TSLA/NVDA or SPY/QQQ or bond markets, investing is the only way within legally allowable means unless one's so genius enough that your financial success can be made. After all, that's how capitalists work out: No need to do physical work, but just sit and play the markets (whether it's time the market or time in the market). And as you know, it's emotionally distressing jobs, when you buy the equity only to find out it's dipping even more, and when you sell only to find out it's skyrocketing. At the end of days, you take the risk, and you either get reward or pay the price. Now, the conclusion is that Per 2020's Census, it's projected that by 2040, 22% of population will be age group over 65. In pure capitalism world, an investor will be held accountable for actions when they are losing the money. But in today's capitalistic world, an investor dont lose the money if it's index funds. That's the fundamental message that Fed sent out in 2008 Financial Crisis and 2020 in Covid19 crashes.

When economy goes down, the best safe harbor investment destination is US dollar in treasury notes that's guaranteed while US is a leading country that have the best state of art companies in many areas and innovative technologies with cutting edge talents, so while the rest of the world suffer, it's perhaps the safest investment. So the index will be different than Japan/Euro zones. At the end of days, what Fed in 2008 and 2020 have shown is that America will never fail (until there is literally no other ways to avoid the failures, which I hope is not within our generation). So investing in US indexes is the same question that should read like ""Do you believe that within your life time, US will continue its success or face failure?"" My bet is that it will continue its success at least until my life time (early 30s). If the answer is yet, consider to to slowly buy SPY/QQQ in different months. If the answer is no, I am not too sure where to invest, but you would be on your own. Time will prove your choice, but even if not, at least, it's worth going to US index if you are investing for 10-20 years.",You do realize there are many people now in their 60s with no retirement nor much exposure to the stock market? Lots of them. I think you are wrongly assuming how much the govt cares for you. Seems pretty obvious to me they don’t care if your portfolio loses 70% of its value.A better argument is they can’t let their rich buddies lose their money. They also need to generate tax revenues via capital gains taxes. More likely cases for them to keep this train rolling.,0,0.53,0.998,NEGATIVE
