,"Hello everyone I started investing a few years ago and made really great returns 20-40% a year. Which is amazing. But, further research led me to know these companies practice what i consider to be unethical. What's not ethical? Wages below founding countries minimum/adjusted for other equivalence in other countries. No slave labor or slave gathering of resources. Aka Apple Killing of innocent. Animals or people. ( Ethical farming is fine, even the slaughting of animals im referring to factory farming or arms companies. Id say even hunting weapons are fine ) Fucking up environment. Water sources, air, etc Fucked up working conditions The only thing that comes to mind is building your own ethical company, reits in a country with high standards or potentially bitcoin. I dont care that people use money for drugs. Tobacco is fine, we're adults who make our own decisions. I think making someone harvest your tobacco for a dollar an hour is unethical, though. All currency is used for crime. I do wonder about the environmental impact on crypto vs like physical gold mining. Basically, it feels like im stealing other people hard worked underpaid hours so i can retire earlier. When the reality is i didn't choose to be born in Canada, this is complete luck. Just as the chinese man didn't choose to be born there, it was just complete luck. So is it ethical to steal his hard earned wages so i can retire early? Any thoughts and words are appreciated. Thank you",This a very Canadian post.,0,0.508,POSITIVE,0.987

If there is neither ethical consumption nor investing (not saying there isn't, just getting along with what the majority here seems to think), does that mean we've all given up on being part of a solution towards a better world, a fairer society?

They're invested in or giving money to things i dont agree with.But i basically need a bank account in todays world especially living in Canada,1,0.521,NEGATIVE,0.997
,"Hello everyone I started investing a few years ago and made really great returns 20-40% a year. Which is amazing. But, further research led me to know these companies practice what i consider to be unethical. What's not ethical? Wages below founding countries minimum/adjusted for other equivalence in other countries. No slave labor or slave gathering of resources. Aka Apple Killing of innocent. Animals or people. ( Ethical farming is fine, even the slaughting of animals im referring to factory farming or arms companies. Id say even hunting weapons are fine ) Fucking up environment. Water sources, air, etc Fucked up working conditions The only thing that comes to mind is building your own ethical company, reits in a country with high standards or potentially bitcoin. I dont care that people use money for drugs. Tobacco is fine, we're adults who make our own decisions. I think making someone harvest your tobacco for a dollar an hour is unethical, though. All currency is used for crime. I do wonder about the environmental impact on crypto vs like physical gold mining. Basically, it feels like im stealing other people hard worked underpaid hours so i can retire earlier. When the reality is i didn't choose to be born in Canada, this is complete luck.

Thank you","Bitcoin wastes energy by design. It isn't just a little inefficient, almost all the energy expended in mining a single block is wasted on computations that are immediately discarded. Nodes perform billions and billions of hashing operations while a block is being mined, but only a single one of them ever results in a finished block. All the other billions of computations achieve literally nothing.It also has an exponentially increasing energy demand by design, because the difficulty of these useless computations keeps doubling.Bitcoin is wholly incompatible with reducing energy usage, which is a requirement to prevent catastrophic climate change.",4,0.517,NEGATIVE,1.0
