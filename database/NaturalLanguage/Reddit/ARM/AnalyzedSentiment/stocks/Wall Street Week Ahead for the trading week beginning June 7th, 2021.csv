,"Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 7th, 2021. AMC, meme stocks could spark more heat in the week ahead as investors await inflation news - (Source) Inflation data is a highlight of the week ahead, as investors focus on economic news in the void between earnings season and the next Fed meeting. May’s consumer price index is scheduled to be reported Thursday, and it could be hot after it surged in April. Inflation is viewed as an important trigger that could cause the Federal Reserve to step back from its easy policies, if rising prices appear to be hotter and more persistent than expected. Equities were higher in the past week, but the meme stocks were far hotter. AMC Entertainment gained another 100% and was up 2,700% since January. Energy was the best-performing major sector, gaining more than 6.7% as oil prices jumped nearly 5% in the past week. REITs were the second-best performer, up 3.1%, followed by financials, up 1.2% and technology, also up 1.2%. But it’s the meme stocks that took the headlines, and also contributed to concerns about froth in the stock market. “People think this is new. It completely isn’t,” Dan Niles, founder of Satori Fund, said of the trading frenzy. He noted there was similar froth in individual stocks in 1999, when companies added dot-com to their names to attract investor attention. “What’s new is the fact that these traders are armed with stimulus checks. They can organize more easily on things like WallStreetBets, they can work from home, and there’s no-cost trading. Those are the differences,” Niles said on CNBC. “So, if it gets people interested in investing, that’s great. What I don’t like is when you have people sort of taking out mortgages on their home, and putting themselves at risk if the thing collapsed,” he added. “You want to be able to invest what you can afford to lose if you’re going to play in something like this.” Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities, said the trading in names like GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond is one of the things that has made him more cautious about the market. He said the high valuations on the meme names are unlikely to last. “It’s going to be around as long as cicadas are,” he said. The S&P 500 in the past week gained 0.6%, rising to 4,229, just 9 points from its all-time high. The Dow was up 0.7% to 34,756, and the Nasdaq gained 0.5% to 13,814. Watching the inflation signs Massocca said investors should stay focused on things like inflation, since that could be what makes the Federal Reserve reverse its easy policy. The Fed has so far said it sees the higher inflation readings as transitory. Economists expect CPI to be up 4.7% year over year, after April’s 4.2% pace, according to Dow Jones. Core inflation is expected to be up 0.4% for the month and 3.4% year over year. “I’m getting nervous. I’m seeing signs of a top. I’m systematically raising cash. I think the market looks too expensive,” Massocca said. “We’re going to shake off the dust from Covid. The economy is going to be very, very good and as a rule, I think monetary policy is going to respond to some degree.” He said the memes mania is just one sign, but the spark for a sell-off could be anything including a hawkish comment from the Fed. “Who knows what it is, but the kindling is building and as soon as a match hits it, the market is setting up for a 7% to 10% pullback at some point,” he said. “Who knows what starts it. ... One of the candidates very likely will be some kind of reductions in monetary policy.” Fear of the Fed stepping back from its easy policy has been hanging over the market. Friday’s May employment report was being watched closely, but the lower-than-expected job gains reinforced that the Fed could continue to hold off on policy changes for the time being. There were 559,000 jobs added in May, well below the 671,000 expected. Now the CPI report is the next point of focus, ahead of the Fed’s June 15-16 meeting. The question is, will it be so hot that the central bank may have to reassess its view about the temporary nature of inflation, or could it show that price increases are peaking? “There’s inflation out there. You can see it everywhere,” said Massocca. Taper talk The market has been expecting the Fed to begin to talk about unwinding its bond buying later this year, with many strategists targeting the Fed’s Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium at the end of August. The Fed is expected to first discuss cutting back its purchases months ahead of taking action. Then it will slowly reduce its buying. After that, it could consider interest rate hikes, now not expected by the market until 2023. Niles said the meme stock trend has been fueled in part by the Fed. The markets are awash in liquidity as the central bank keeps rates at zero and maintains its monthly purchases of at least $120 billion in Treasury and mortgage securities. “When the Fed backs off of that with tapering, I think that’s when you can go in and say, ‘OK’ we can potentially go after and short some of these highly valued names because that’s when the free money disappears and you actually start to contract some of that free money,” he said. “That’s when things start to get dangerous to the downside.” For now, Niles said he’s staying away from the names that are heavily sought by retail investors or have large short interest and are targeted by Wall Street. “You want to stay away from this stuff now unless you’re doing it in very small size,” he said. There are just a few earnings in the week ahead. One of the handful of names reporting is meme name GameStop on Wednesday. Campbell Soup also reports that day, and Chewy reports Thursday. G-7 finance ministers meet this weekend, and President Joe Biden will attend a meeting of the organization’s leaders in Cornwall, England, on Friday.

May Payrolls Not Too Hot, Not Too Cold Before diving into today’s jobs report for May, it will be a useful exercise to recall the curveball that April’s report threw at investors. One of the more hotly contested topics investors have been debating recently is what to make of the jobs report released one month ago, where the consensus expectation was for 1,000,000 new jobs and we only got 266,000 (since revised up to 278,000). On the one hand, data releases are volatile by nature and it is possible that the large miss could have been broadly dismissed as a “one off” among a package of otherwise very healthy economic data. On the other hand, it did confirm anecdotal evidence of difficult hiring conditions facing companies and reinforced the notion that some workers may be reluctant to return to the workforce for a whole host of reasons. Moreover, if the April report really did unearth new evidence of a weaker-than-expected jobs market in this latter scenario, should we view the effect as temporary or does it have staying power that could spell new trouble for the overall economic recovery? Against this backdrop, investors were hoping that today’s May jobs report would go a long way towards providing some definitive answers to these important questions. It did not. But, that might actually be a good thing. Here are some key takeaways: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ May employment report revealed that the domestic economy added 559,000 jobs in May, slightly below Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ median forecast for a gain of 675,000. The prior two months also received net positive revisions of 27,000 jobs. The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 5.8%, though that was paired with a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate, which moved from 61.7% to 61.6%. Average hourly earnings rose 0.5% month over month, again signaling lower-wage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected. More new lower-wage jobs would be expected to put more downward pressure on wage increases. “It is hard to view 559,000 added jobs as a disappointment, but it does leave something to be desired,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market > Strategist Ryan Detrick. “There is strong potential for job prints in excess of one million over the coming months, but the truth is as strong as the economy is right now, the employment backdrop is clearly lagging what we were all expecting just a few months ago.” As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, May’s jobs number did jump above April’s disappointment, but still came well short of making a fresh new high for 2021. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Where do we go from here? The US economy is still 7.6 million total payrolls shy of its peak prior to the recession, and given the magnitude of that number, we still believe there is the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months. Several catalysts should also lend a helping hand in the near future. Enhanced unemployment benefits may be deterring lower-wage workers from returning to the labor market, as they reduce the relative attractiveness of a paycheck from an employer. In the last month, about half of all states have started eliminating these added benefits in order to reduce the disincentive. We believe this should show up in the data starting with the June employment report. Also, schools might be closing for the summer, but daycare centers are reopening more broadly, freeing parents up to find jobs. Warmer weather, ever-improving vaccination trends, and increasing comfort reengaging in normal activities should all play their parts as well. The labor market will always be inextricably linked to the inflation outlook, this cycle perhaps more than past cycles, and for many that is the real story today. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has made it clear it will tolerate near-term inflation overshoots in order to achieve “substantial further progress” towards its employment goals before it begins taking measures to combat higher inflation. Recent hotter-than-expected inflation reports have increasingly turned the spotlight towards the Fed’s timeline for reducing their asset purchases, which, given their stated position, will depend on strong payroll reports. As such, we find ourselves (to a degree) in a “good news is bad news” scenario, as strong labor market readings could hasten the Fed’s timetable to begin normalizing monetary policy. Today’s report likely did little to convince the Fed that the labor market is closer to meeting its “substantial further progress” goal on employment, and therefore, all else equal, will not compel them to consider reducing asset purchases sooner rather than later. There is much ground still to be made up in the labor market, and we believe the Fed will need to see a string of strong reports, likely in the one million range, before it begins to take action. From a Fed intervention standpoint, today’s employment report likely found a sweet spot, and the early indications are that equity markets are breathing a sigh of relief. For a deeper dive into the inflation picture, check the blog on Thursday, June 10, when data for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation is set to be released. Big First 5 Months Gains Consolidate Over Worst Months S&P 500 is up an impressive 11.9% for the first five months of 2021. That is the 16th best gain for the first five months since 1950. As illustrated in the graph above, gains do beget gains and this bodes well for the year as a whole. But this does not diminish the seasonal pattern of consolidation and mostly sideways market action over the Worst Six Months May-October and even more so over the Worst Four Months July-October. We tabulated the gains for the top 20 first five month gains since 1950 and the gains for the last seven months of the year are still pretty solid averaging 9.4% vs. 14.7% for the top 20 first five months. But the bulk of those gains as you can see in the graph come from late-October to yearend. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) June Swoon? Although there was some notable weakness in the middle of May, the S&P 500 Index was able to rally late in the month to finish with a modest gain. Incredibly, this was the eighth year out of the past nine that stocks gained during in May. Who said Sell in May? (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) As we noted a month ago, the worst six months of the year indeed are May through October, so we are still in the thick of a potentially challenging period based on seasonality. “After a nearly 90% rally off the lows, stocks could be ripe for a pullback, especially during the historically weak month of June,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But with the improving economy, coupled with historic fiscal and monetary stimulus, we expect any weakness to be short-lived.” (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Here are some stats to think about regarding S&P 500 performance in June: Since 1950, June is the 4th worst month of the year (September, February, and August are worse). It has been higher the past 5 years in a row, the longest since a stretch of 6 in a row in the late 1990s. The past 10 years, though, June was up 1.0% on average, ranking as the 7th best month. According to Sam Stovall of CFRA, only 5 market declines in excess of 5% started in June versus an average of 8 for all 12 months (since WWII). In other words, it isn’t common for major market weakness to start in June. Building on this, when the S&P 500 is lower in June, it is down by 2.9% on average. This is the second smallest average loss, with only December better at -2.5%. We wouldn’t be surprised at all if stocks took a well-deserved break in June, but this month is rather misunderstood, as a massive sell-off or the start of significant weakness isn’t likely, as that isn’t what June typically brings. Lastly, last Wednesday marked the 100th trading day of the year for the S&P 500. In fact, the S&P 500 was up more than 10% on the 100th day, which historically is a great start to the year, but also has meant continued strong performance the rest of the year is quite normal. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when stocks are up more than 10% on day 100, the rest of the year has been higher 84.2% of the time and up 8.6% on average, both well above what the average year does. We continue to recommend an overweight to equities and underweight to fixed-income position relative to investors’ targets, as appropriate. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Less Than 20% Bearish For the First Time in 115 Weeks Bullish sentiment measured through the AAII weekly survey was at the lowest level since the fall last week, but after jumping 7.7 percentage points, it is now at the highest level since the end of April. Not only is it high relative to the past few weeks, but the increase also brings bullish sentiment 6 percentage points back above its historical average. Additionally, the week over week increase was the largest since the week of April 8th when the reading had risen 11.1 percentage points. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) In recent weeks, neutral sentiment had been surging; topping 37% last week for the highest reading since the first week of 2020. Although it reversed lower this week down to 36.2%, neutral sentiment remains around some of the strongest levels in over a year. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) With the pickup in bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment plummeted to 19.8% on a 6.6 percentage point decile; the largest since February. Falling below 20%, bearish sentiment took out its March and April lows and is now at the lowest level since January 2018. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Not only is that one of the lowest readings in bearish sentiment in recent history, but that drop below 20% brought to an end a 115-week long streak of readings in bearish sentiment above that level. As shown below, that surpassed a three-week shorter streak ending in December 2017 to make for the second-longest such streak on record. The longest streak which ended in December 2010 went on for more than twice as long as this most recent run. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Historically, lower readings in bearish sentiment have tended towards weaker performance for the S&P 500 going forward as shown below. But when it comes to the past times that bearish sentiment has broken below 20% for the first time in at least 50 weeks, performance has actually tended to consistently be positive. In fact, across each of the past six instances, the S&P 500 has been higher six months out every time. Granted, for the most part the typical move higher is usually smaller than other periods. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Typical June Trading: Any Early Gains Tend to Fade Especially After Mid-Month Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-caps. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Main Street Sentiment Strongest in Over a Decade The U.S. economy is opening up and overall sentiment on Main Street is the strongest it’s been since our earliest analysis in 2005, according to LPL Research’s proprietary Beige Book Barometer (BBB). The result is based on our analysis of the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, a publication released two weeks before each Fed policy meeting that captures qualitative observations made by community bankers and business owners—what we like to think of as “Main Street” rather than “Wall Street.” The BBB gauges Main Street’s sentiment by looking at how frequently key words and phrases appear in the text. In the most recent Beige Book, “strong” words were near their highest since we first began tracking data in 2005 while weak words were their lowest on record, resulting in the strongest overall sentiment reading since inception. The strong reading is likely driven more by a change in direction than in overall activity, but even that is a welcome shift. “The country and the economy are going through a disruptive but positive change as most COVID-related restrictions are lifted and the economy reopens,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Sentiment is up and that’s a great sign for the direction of the economy.” (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) This was an important Beige Book in other ways. Mentions of COVID-related words (virus, COVID, pandemic) fell to their lowest level since the March 2020 Beige Book, when the words first started to appear. More concerning, words related to inflation also rose to their highest level since our earliest analysis. The downside of the economy’s rapid acceleration has been a mismatch between demand, which can ramp up quickly, and supply, which comes on line more slowly, while labor markets have also been slow to keep pace with reopening. Overall, the fundamental backdrop for the economy remains positive. Supply chain disruptions can slow the pace of the economic rebound but are likely temporary, while we expect reopening to be enduring. There is still some risk around variants, however, and full supply chain relief will likely need support from accelerated global vaccine distribution. US economic acceleration will probably peak in the second quarter, but there’s still plenty of scope for growth to moderate and still remain above average. Much of the positive news is already priced in for equity markets, which are forward looking, and gains may not come as easily, but we still see solid potential for upside as the economy continues to rebound. S&P 500 Returns Relative to History May has moved back to the rearview mirror and with that, we wanted to provide an update on how current long-term returns for the S&P 500 stack up relative to history. The chart below compares the trailing one, two, five, ten, and twenty-year annualized total returns of the S&P 500 to the S&P 500's historical average returns over those same time periods since 1928. We're starting to move away from the 'easy comps' in terms of market returns relative to the March 2020 lows, but the S&P 500 is still up more than 40% over the last 12 months which is nearly four times the historical average one year return. Over the last two years, the S&P 500's annualized return of 25.8% still comes in at more than twice the historical average of 10.6%. On a five and ten-year basis, the S&P 500's annualized gain also remains comfortably above 10%. All in all, the last decade has been very good for US equity investors. The only time period where the S&P 500 has experienced below-average returns is at the 20-year window where the 8.4% annualized gain clocks in at 2.5 percentage less than the historical average of 10.9%. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) The chart below compares the S&P 500's current returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to all other periods on a percentile basis. With mostly above-average returns, it comes as no surprise that most of the percentile readings rank above the 50th percentile, and for most time periods, the percentile rank comes in well above 50%. The one-year total return of more than 40% actually ranks just above the 93rd percentile, while the two-year return isn't far from the 90th percentile either. Moving further out, each of the other readings going out to ten years are all well above the 50th percentile. The only percentile rank below the 50th percentile is the 20-year window and that reading isn't even close. On the one hand, the last ten years have been phenomenal for equity investors, but the last 20 years haven't even been mediocre. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Throughout history, many investors have always worked under the assumption that long-term returns for the equity market are about 10%. History has shown that to be the case over the last decade at least, as the average annualized one-year gain of the S&P 500 has been well above 10%. With the S&P 500's current 20-year annualized gain currently at just 8.4%, though, what will it take for the S&P 500 to reach double-digit gains on an annualized basis over a 20-year window? For an idea, given the strong performance of the last ten years, a number of commentators suggest that the next ten years for equities will be weak with a reversion to the mean. Only time will tell, but if we operate under the (unlikely) assumption that the S&P 500 stays at the exact same level it is now going forward for the next ten years, its annualized twenty-year return would top 10% for the first time since August 2008 next September. After that brief period above 10% from September 2022 through March 2023, it wouldn't again top that level until February 2029. In spite of the fact that the annualized 20-year return would top 10% in those two periods, though, it still wouldn't get as high as the historical average of 10.9% in either of those periods. This reflects the fact that although the last ten years for US equities have been very strong, they also came shortly after one of the worst ten-year periods for US equities on record.

,"Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 7th, 2021. AMC, meme stocks could spark more heat in the week ahead as investors await inflation news - (Source) Inflation data is a highlight of the week ahead, as investors focus on economic news in the void between earnings season and the next Fed meeting.

May Payrolls Not Too Hot, Not Too Cold Before diving into today’s jobs report for May, it will be a useful exercise to recall the curveball that April’s report threw at investors. One of the more hotly contested topics investors have been debating recently is what to make of the jobs report released one month ago, where the consensus expectation was for 1,000,000 new jobs and we only got 266,000 (since revised up to 278,000). On the one hand, data releases are volatile by nature and it is possible that the large miss could have been broadly dismissed as a “one off” among a package of otherwise very healthy economic data. On the other hand, it did confirm anecdotal evidence of difficult hiring conditions facing companies and reinforced the notion that some workers may be reluctant to return to the workforce for a whole host of reasons. Moreover, if the April report really did unearth new evidence of a weaker-than-expected jobs market in this latter scenario, should we view the effect as temporary or does it have staying power that could spell new trouble for the overall economic recovery? Against this backdrop, investors were hoping that today’s May jobs report would go a long way towards providing some definitive answers to these important questions. It did not. But, that might actually be a good thing. Here are some key takeaways: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ May employment report revealed that the domestic economy added 559,000 jobs in May, slightly below Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ median forecast for a gain of 675,000. The prior two months also received net positive revisions of 27,000 jobs. The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 5.8%, though that was paired with a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate, which moved from 61.7% to 61.6%. Average hourly earnings rose 0.5% month over month, again signaling lower-wage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected. More new lower-wage jobs would be expected to put more downward pressure on wage increases. “It is hard to view 559,000 added jobs as a disappointment, but it does leave something to be desired,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market > Strategist Ryan Detrick. “There is strong potential for job prints in excess of one million over the coming months, but the truth is as strong as the economy is right now, the employment backdrop is clearly lagging what we were all expecting just a few months ago.” As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, May’s jobs number did jump above April’s disappointment, but still came well short of making a fresh new high for 2021. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Where do we go from here? The US economy is still 7.6 million total payrolls shy of its peak prior to the recession, and given the magnitude of that number, we still believe there is the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months. Several catalysts should also lend a helping hand in the near future. Enhanced unemployment benefits may be deterring lower-wage workers from returning to the labor market, as they reduce the relative attractiveness of a paycheck from an employer. In the last month, about half of all states have started eliminating these added benefits in order to reduce the disincentive. We believe this should show up in the data starting with the June employment report. Also, schools might be closing for the summer, but daycare centers are reopening more broadly, freeing parents up to find jobs. Warmer weather, ever-improving vaccination trends, and increasing comfort reengaging in normal activities should all play their parts as well. The labor market will always be inextricably linked to the inflation outlook, this cycle perhaps more than past cycles, and for many that is the real story today. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has made it clear it will tolerate near-term inflation overshoots in order to achieve “substantial further progress” towards its employment goals before it begins taking measures to combat higher inflation. Recent hotter-than-expected inflation reports have increasingly turned the spotlight towards the Fed’s timeline for reducing their asset purchases, which, given their stated position, will depend on strong payroll reports. As such, we find ourselves (to a degree) in a “good news is bad news” scenario, as strong labor market readings could hasten the Fed’s timetable to begin normalizing monetary policy. Today’s report likely did little to convince the Fed that the labor market is closer to meeting its “substantial further progress” goal on employment, and therefore, all else equal, will not compel them to consider reducing asset purchases sooner rather than later. There is much ground still to be made up in the labor market, and we believe the Fed will need to see a string of strong reports, likely in the one million range, before it begins to take action. From a Fed intervention standpoint, today’s employment report likely found a sweet spot, and the early indications are that equity markets are breathing a sigh of relief. For a deeper dive into the inflation picture, check the blog on Thursday, June 10, when data for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation is set to be released. Big First 5 Months Gains Consolidate Over Worst Months S&P 500 is up an impressive 11.9% for the first five months of 2021. That is the 16th best gain for the first five months since 1950. As illustrated in the graph above, gains do beget gains and this bodes well for the year as a whole. But this does not diminish the seasonal pattern of consolidation and mostly sideways market action over the Worst Six Months May-October and even more so over the Worst Four Months July-October. We tabulated the gains for the top 20 first five month gains since 1950 and the gains for the last seven months of the year are still pretty solid averaging 9.4% vs. 14.7% for the top 20 first five months. But the bulk of those gains as you can see in the graph come from late-October to yearend. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) June Swoon? Although there was some notable weakness in the middle of May, the S&P 500 Index was able to rally late in the month to finish with a modest gain. Incredibly, this was the eighth year out of the past nine that stocks gained during in May. Who said Sell in May? (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) As we noted a month ago, the worst six months of the year indeed are May through October, so we are still in the thick of a potentially challenging period based on seasonality. “After a nearly 90% rally off the lows, stocks could be ripe for a pullback, especially during the historically weak month of June,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But with the improving economy, coupled with historic fiscal and monetary stimulus, we expect any weakness to be short-lived.” (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Here are some stats to think about regarding S&P 500 performance in June: Since 1950, June is the 4th worst month of the year (September, February, and August are worse). It has been higher the past 5 years in a row, the longest since a stretch of 6 in a row in the late 1990s. The past 10 years, though, June was up 1.0% on average, ranking as the 7th best month. According to Sam Stovall of CFRA, only 5 market declines in excess of 5% started in June versus an average of 8 for all 12 months (since WWII). In other words, it isn’t common for major market weakness to start in June. Building on this, when the S&P 500 is lower in June, it is down by 2.9% on average. This is the second smallest average loss, with only December better at -2.5%. We wouldn’t be surprised at all if stocks took a well-deserved break in June, but this month is rather misunderstood, as a massive sell-off or the start of significant weakness isn’t likely, as that isn’t what June typically brings. Lastly, last Wednesday marked the 100th trading day of the year for the S&P 500. In fact, the S&P 500 was up more than 10% on the 100th day, which historically is a great start to the year, but also has meant continued strong performance the rest of the year is quite normal. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when stocks are up more than 10% on day 100, the rest of the year has been higher 84.2% of the time and up 8.6% on average, both well above what the average year does. We continue to recommend an overweight to equities and underweight to fixed-income position relative to investors’ targets, as appropriate. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Less Than 20% Bearish For the First Time in 115 Weeks Bullish sentiment measured through the AAII weekly survey was at the lowest level since the fall last week, but after jumping 7.7 percentage points, it is now at the highest level since the end of April. Not only is it high relative to the past few weeks, but the increase also brings bullish sentiment 6 percentage points back above its historical average. Additionally, the week over week increase was the largest since the week of April 8th when the reading had risen 11.1 percentage points. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) In recent weeks, neutral sentiment had been surging; topping 37% last week for the highest reading since the first week of 2020. Although it reversed lower this week down to 36.2%, neutral sentiment remains around some of the strongest levels in over a year. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) With the pickup in bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment plummeted to 19.8% on a 6.6 percentage point decile; the largest since February. Falling below 20%, bearish sentiment took out its March and April lows and is now at the lowest level since January 2018. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Not only is that one of the lowest readings in bearish sentiment in recent history, but that drop below 20% brought to an end a 115-week long streak of readings in bearish sentiment above that level. As shown below, that surpassed a three-week shorter streak ending in December 2017 to make for the second-longest such streak on record. The longest streak which ended in December 2010 went on for more than twice as long as this most recent run. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Historically, lower readings in bearish sentiment have tended towards weaker performance for the S&P 500 going forward as shown below. But when it comes to the past times that bearish sentiment has broken below 20% for the first time in at least 50 weeks, performance has actually tended to consistently be positive. In fact, across each of the past six instances, the S&P 500 has been higher six months out every time. Granted, for the most part the typical move higher is usually smaller than other periods. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Typical June Trading: Any Early Gains Tend to Fade Especially After Mid-Month Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-caps. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Main Street Sentiment Strongest in Over a Decade The U.S. economy is opening up and overall sentiment on Main Street is the strongest it’s been since our earliest analysis in 2005, according to LPL Research’s proprietary Beige Book Barometer (BBB). The result is based on our analysis of the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, a publication released two weeks before each Fed policy meeting that captures qualitative observations made by community bankers and business owners—what we like to think of as “Main Street” rather than “Wall Street.” The BBB gauges Main Street’s sentiment by looking at how frequently key words and phrases appear in the text. In the most recent Beige Book, “strong” words were near their highest since we first began tracking data in 2005 while weak words were their lowest on record, resulting in the strongest overall sentiment reading since inception. The strong reading is likely driven more by a change in direction than in overall activity, but even that is a welcome shift. “The country and the economy are going through a disruptive but positive change as most COVID-related restrictions are lifted and the economy reopens,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Sentiment is up and that’s a great sign for the direction of the economy.” (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) This was an important Beige Book in other ways. Mentions of COVID-related words (virus, COVID, pandemic) fell to their lowest level since the March 2020 Beige Book, when the words first started to appear. More concerning, words related to inflation also rose to their highest level since our earliest analysis. The downside of the economy’s rapid acceleration has been a mismatch between demand, which can ramp up quickly, and supply, which comes on line more slowly, while labor markets have also been slow to keep pace with reopening. Overall, the fundamental backdrop for the economy remains positive. Supply chain disruptions can slow the pace of the economic rebound but are likely temporary, while we expect reopening to be enduring. There is still some risk around variants, however, and full supply chain relief will likely need support from accelerated global vaccine distribution. US economic acceleration will probably peak in the second quarter, but there’s still plenty of scope for growth to moderate and still remain above average. Much of the positive news is already priced in for equity markets, which are forward looking, and gains may not come as easily, but we still see solid potential for upside as the economy continues to rebound. S&P 500 Returns Relative to History May has moved back to the rearview mirror and with that, we wanted to provide an update on how current long-term returns for the S&P 500 stack up relative to history. The chart below compares the trailing one, two, five, ten, and twenty-year annualized total returns of the S&P 500 to the S&P 500's historical average returns over those same time periods since 1928. We're starting to move away from the 'easy comps' in terms of market returns relative to the March 2020 lows, but the S&P 500 is still up more than 40% over the last 12 months which is nearly four times the historical average one year return. Over the last two years, the S&P 500's annualized return of 25.8% still comes in at more than twice the historical average of 10.6%. On a five and ten-year basis, the S&P 500's annualized gain also remains comfortably above 10%. All in all, the last decade has been very good for US equity investors. The only time period where the S&P 500 has experienced below-average returns is at the 20-year window where the 8.4% annualized gain clocks in at 2.5 percentage less than the historical average of 10.9%. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) The chart below compares the S&P 500's current returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to all other periods on a percentile basis. With mostly above-average returns, it comes as no surprise that most of the percentile readings rank above the 50th percentile, and for most time periods, the percentile rank comes in well above 50%. The one-year total return of more than 40% actually ranks just above the 93rd percentile, while the two-year return isn't far from the 90th percentile either. Moving further out, each of the other readings going out to ten years are all well above the 50th percentile. The only percentile rank below the 50th percentile is the 20-year window and that reading isn't even close. On the one hand, the last ten years have been phenomenal for equity investors, but the last 20 years haven't even been mediocre. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Throughout history, many investors have always worked under the assumption that long-term returns for the equity market are about 10%. History has shown that to be the case over the last decade at least, as the average annualized one-year gain of the S&P 500 has been well above 10%. With the S&P 500's current 20-year annualized gain currently at just 8.4%, though, what will it take for the S&P 500 to reach double-digit gains on an annualized basis over a 20-year window? For an idea, given the strong performance of the last ten years, a number of commentators suggest that the next ten years for equities will be weak with a reversion to the mean. Only time will tell, but if we operate under the (unlikely) assumption that the S&P 500 stays at the exact same level it is now going forward for the next ten years, its annualized twenty-year return would top 10% for the first time since August 2008 next September. After that brief period above 10% from September 2022 through March 2023, it wouldn't again top that level until February 2029. In spite of the fact that the annualized 20-year return would top 10% in those two periods, though, it still wouldn't get as high as the historical average of 10.9% in either of those periods. This reflects the fact that although the last ten years for US equities have been very strong, they also came shortly after one of the worst ten-year periods for US equities on record.

,"Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 7th, 2021. AMC, meme stocks could spark more heat in the week ahead as investors await inflation news - (Source) Inflation data is a highlight of the week ahead, as investors focus on economic news in the void between earnings season and the next Fed meeting. May’s consumer price index is scheduled to be reported Thursday, and it could be hot after it surged in April. Inflation is viewed as an important trigger that could cause the Federal Reserve to step back from its easy policies, if rising prices appear to be hotter and more persistent than expected. Equities were higher in the past week, but the meme stocks were far hotter. AMC Entertainment gained another 100% and was up 2,700% since January. Energy was the best-performing major sector, gaining more than 6.7% as oil prices jumped nearly 5% in the past week. REITs were the second-best performer, up 3.1%, followed by financials, up 1.2% and technology, also up 1.2%. But it’s the meme stocks that took the headlines, and also contributed to concerns about froth in the stock market. “People think this is new. It completely isn’t,” Dan Niles, founder of Satori Fund, said of the trading frenzy. He noted there was similar froth in individual stocks in 1999, when companies added dot-com to their names to attract investor attention. “What’s new is the fact that these traders are armed with stimulus checks. They can organize more easily on things like WallStreetBets, they can work from home, and there’s no-cost trading. Those are the differences,” Niles said on CNBC. “So, if it gets people interested in investing, that’s great. What I don’t like is when you have people sort of taking out mortgages on their home, and putting themselves at risk if the thing collapsed,” he added. “You want to be able to invest what you can afford to lose if you’re going to play in something like this.” Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities, said the trading in names like GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond is one of the things that has made him more cautious about the market. He said the high valuations on the meme names are unlikely to last. “It’s going to be around as long as cicadas are,” he said. The S&P 500 in the past week gained 0.6%, rising to 4,229, just 9 points from its all-time high. The Dow was up 0.7% to 34,756, and the Nasdaq gained 0.5% to 13,814. Watching the inflation signs Massocca said investors should stay focused on things like inflation, since that could be what makes the Federal Reserve reverse its easy policy. The Fed has so far said it sees the higher inflation readings as transitory. Economists expect CPI to be up 4.7% year over year, after April’s 4.2% pace, according to Dow Jones. Core inflation is expected to be up 0.4% for the month and 3.4% year over year. “I’m getting nervous. I’m seeing signs of a top. I’m systematically raising cash. I think the market looks too expensive,” Massocca said. “We’re going to shake off the dust from Covid. The economy is going to be very, very good and as a rule, I think monetary policy is going to respond to some degree.” He said the memes mania is just one sign, but the spark for a sell-off could be anything including a hawkish comment from the Fed. “Who knows what it is, but the kindling is building and as soon as a match hits it, the market is setting up for a 7% to 10% pullback at some point,” he said. “Who knows what starts it. ... One of the candidates very likely will be some kind of reductions in monetary policy.” Fear of the Fed stepping back from its easy policy has been hanging over the market. Friday’s May employment report was being watched closely, but the lower-than-expected job gains reinforced that the Fed could continue to hold off on policy changes for the time being. There were 559,000 jobs added in May, well below the 671,000 expected. Now the CPI report is the next point of focus, ahead of the Fed’s June 15-16 meeting. The question is, will it be so hot that the central bank may have to reassess its view about the temporary nature of inflation, or could it show that price increases are peaking? “There’s inflation out there. You can see it everywhere,” said Massocca. Taper talk The market has been expecting the Fed to begin to talk about unwinding its bond buying later this year, with many strategists targeting the Fed’s Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium at the end of August. The Fed is expected to first discuss cutting back its purchases months ahead of taking action. Then it will slowly reduce its buying. After that, it could consider interest rate hikes, now not expected by the market until 2023. Niles said the meme stock trend has been fueled in part by the Fed. The markets are awash in liquidity as the central bank keeps rates at zero and maintains its monthly purchases of at least $120 billion in Treasury and mortgage securities. “When the Fed backs off of that with tapering, I think that’s when you can go in and say, ‘OK’ we can potentially go after and short some of these highly valued names because that’s when the free money disappears and you actually start to contract some of that free money,” he said. “That’s when things start to get dangerous to the downside.” For now, Niles said he’s staying away from the names that are heavily sought by retail investors or have large short interest and are targeted by Wall Street. “You want to stay away from this stuff now unless you’re doing it in very small size,” he said. There are just a few earnings in the week ahead. One of the handful of names reporting is meme name GameStop on Wednesday. Campbell Soup also reports that day, and Chewy reports Thursday. G-7 finance ministers meet this weekend, and President Joe Biden will attend a meeting of the organization’s leaders in Cornwall, England, on Friday.

Although there was some notable weakness in the middle of May, the S&P 500 Index was able to rally late in the month to finish with a modest gain. Incredibly, this was the eighth year out of the past nine that stocks gained during in May. Who said Sell in May? (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) As we noted a month ago, the worst six months of the year indeed are May through October, so we are still in the thick of a potentially challenging period based on seasonality. “After a nearly 90% rally off the lows, stocks could be ripe for a pullback, especially during the historically weak month of June,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But with the improving economy, coupled with historic fiscal and monetary stimulus, we expect any weakness to be short-lived.” (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Here are some stats to think about regarding S&P 500 performance in June: Since 1950, June is the 4th worst month of the year (September, February, and August are worse). It has been higher the past 5 years in a row, the longest since a stretch of 6 in a row in the late 1990s. The past 10 years, though, June was up 1.0% on average, ranking as the 7th best month. According to Sam Stovall of CFRA, only 5 market declines in excess of 5% started in June versus an average of 8 for all 12 months (since WWII). In other words, it isn’t common for major market weakness to start in June. Building on this, when the S&P 500 is lower in June, it is down by 2.9% on average. This is the second smallest average loss, with only December better at -2.5%. We wouldn’t be surprised at all if stocks took a well-deserved break in June, but this month is rather misunderstood, as a massive sell-off or the start of significant weakness isn’t likely, as that isn’t what June typically brings. Lastly, last Wednesday marked the 100th trading day of the year for the S&P 500. In fact, the S&P 500 was up more than 10% on the 100th day, which historically is a great start to the year, but also has meant continued strong performance the rest of the year is quite normal. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when stocks are up more than 10% on day 100, the rest of the year has been higher 84.2% of the time and up 8.6% on average, both well above what the average year does. We continue to recommend an overweight to equities and underweight to fixed-income position relative to investors’ targets, as appropriate. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Less Than 20% Bearish For the First Time in 115 Weeks Bullish sentiment measured through the AAII weekly survey was at the lowest level since the fall last week, but after jumping 7.7 percentage points, it is now at the highest level since the end of April. Not only is it high relative to the past few weeks, but the increase also brings bullish sentiment 6 percentage points back above its historical average. Additionally, the week over week increase was the largest since the week of April 8th when the reading had risen 11.1 percentage points. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) In recent weeks, neutral sentiment had been surging; topping 37% last week for the highest reading since the first week of 2020. Although it reversed lower this week down to 36.2%, neutral sentiment remains around some of the strongest levels in over a year. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) With the pickup in bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment plummeted to 19.8% on a 6.6 percentage point decile; the largest since February. Falling below 20%, bearish sentiment took out its March and April lows and is now at the lowest level since January 2018. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Not only is that one of the lowest readings in bearish sentiment in recent history, but that drop below 20% brought to an end a 115-week long streak of readings in bearish sentiment above that level. As shown below, that surpassed a three-week shorter streak ending in December 2017 to make for the second-longest such streak on record. The longest streak which ended in December 2010 went on for more than twice as long as this most recent run. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Historically, lower readings in bearish sentiment have tended towards weaker performance for the S&P 500 going forward as shown below. But when it comes to the past times that bearish sentiment has broken below 20% for the first time in at least 50 weeks, performance has actually tended to consistently be positive. In fact, across each of the past six instances, the S&P 500 has been higher six months out every time. Granted, for the most part the typical move higher is usually smaller than other periods. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Typical June Trading: Any Early Gains Tend to Fade Especially After Mid-Month Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-caps. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Main Street Sentiment Strongest in Over a Decade The U.S. economy is opening up and overall sentiment on Main Street is the strongest it’s been since our earliest analysis in 2005, according to LPL Research’s proprietary Beige Book Barometer (BBB). The result is based on our analysis of the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, a publication released two weeks before each Fed policy meeting that captures qualitative observations made by community bankers and business owners—what we like to think of as “Main Street” rather than “Wall Street.” The BBB gauges Main Street’s sentiment by looking at how frequently key words and phrases appear in the text. In the most recent Beige Book, “strong” words were near their highest since we first began tracking data in 2005 while weak words were their lowest on record, resulting in the strongest overall sentiment reading since inception. The strong reading is likely driven more by a change in direction than in overall activity, but even that is a welcome shift. “The country and the economy are going through a disruptive but positive change as most COVID-related restrictions are lifted and the economy reopens,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Sentiment is up and that’s a great sign for the direction of the economy.” (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) This was an important Beige Book in other ways. Mentions of COVID-related words (virus, COVID, pandemic) fell to their lowest level since the March 2020 Beige Book, when the words first started to appear. More concerning, words related to inflation also rose to their highest level since our earliest analysis. The downside of the economy’s rapid acceleration has been a mismatch between demand, which can ramp up quickly, and supply, which comes on line more slowly, while labor markets have also been slow to keep pace with reopening. Overall, the fundamental backdrop for the economy remains positive. Supply chain disruptions can slow the pace of the economic rebound but are likely temporary, while we expect reopening to be enduring. There is still some risk around variants, however, and full supply chain relief will likely need support from accelerated global vaccine distribution. US economic acceleration will probably peak in the second quarter, but there’s still plenty of scope for growth to moderate and still remain above average. Much of the positive news is already priced in for equity markets, which are forward looking, and gains may not come as easily, but we still see solid potential for upside as the economy continues to rebound. S&P 500 Returns Relative to History May has moved back to the rearview mirror and with that, we wanted to provide an update on how current long-term returns for the S&P 500 stack up relative to history. The chart below compares the trailing one, two, five, ten, and twenty-year annualized total returns of the S&P 500 to the S&P 500's historical average returns over those same time periods since 1928. We're starting to move away from the 'easy comps' in terms of market returns relative to the March 2020 lows, but the S&P 500 is still up more than 40% over the last 12 months which is nearly four times the historical average one year return. Over the last two years, the S&P 500's annualized return of 25.8% still comes in at more than twice the historical average of 10.6%. On a five and ten-year basis, the S&P 500's annualized gain also remains comfortably above 10%. All in all, the last decade has been very good for US equity investors. The only time period where the S&P 500 has experienced below-average returns is at the 20-year window where the 8.4% annualized gain clocks in at 2.5 percentage less than the historical average of 10.9%. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) The chart below compares the S&P 500's current returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to all other periods on a percentile basis. With mostly above-average returns, it comes as no surprise that most of the percentile readings rank above the 50th percentile, and for most time periods, the percentile rank comes in well above 50%. The one-year total return of more than 40% actually ranks just above the 93rd percentile, while the two-year return isn't far from the 90th percentile either. Moving further out, each of the other readings going out to ten years are all well above the 50th percentile. The only percentile rank below the 50th percentile is the 20-year window and that reading isn't even close. On the one hand, the last ten years have been phenomenal for equity investors, but the last 20 years haven't even been mediocre. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Throughout history, many investors have always worked under the assumption that long-term returns for the equity market are about 10%. History has shown that to be the case over the last decade at least, as the average annualized one-year gain of the S&P 500 has been well above 10%. With the S&P 500's current 20-year annualized gain currently at just 8.4%, though, what will it take for the S&P 500 to reach double-digit gains on an annualized basis over a 20-year window? For an idea, given the strong performance of the last ten years, a number of commentators suggest that the next ten years for equities will be weak with a reversion to the mean. Only time will tell, but if we operate under the (unlikely) assumption that the S&P 500 stays at the exact same level it is now going forward for the next ten years, its annualized twenty-year return would top 10% for the first time since August 2008 next September. After that brief period above 10% from September 2022 through March 2023, it wouldn't again top that level until February 2029. In spite of the fact that the annualized 20-year return would top 10% in those two periods, though, it still wouldn't get as high as the historical average of 10.9% in either of those periods. This reflects the fact that although the last ten years for US equities have been very strong, they also came shortly after one of the worst ten-year periods for US equities on record.

,"Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 7th, 2021. AMC, meme stocks could spark more heat in the week ahead as investors await inflation news - (Source) Inflation data is a highlight of the week ahead, as investors focus on economic news in the void between earnings season and the next Fed meeting. May’s consumer price index is scheduled to be reported Thursday, and it could be hot after it surged in April. Inflation is viewed as an important trigger that could cause the Federal Reserve to step back from its easy policies, if rising prices appear to be hotter and more persistent than expected. Equities were higher in the past week, but the meme stocks were far hotter. AMC Entertainment gained another 100% and was up 2,700% since January. Energy was the best-performing major sector, gaining more than 6.7% as oil prices jumped nearly 5% in the past week. REITs were the second-best performer, up 3.1%, followed by financials, up 1.2% and technology, also up 1.2%. But it’s the meme stocks that took the headlines, and also contributed to concerns about froth in the stock market. “People think this is new. It completely isn’t,” Dan Niles, founder of Satori Fund, said of the trading frenzy. He noted there was similar froth in individual stocks in 1999, when companies added dot-com to their names to attract investor attention. “What’s new is the fact that these traders are armed with stimulus checks. They can organize more easily on things like WallStreetBets, they can work from home, and there’s no-cost trading. Those are the differences,” Niles said on CNBC. “So, if it gets people interested in investing, that’s great. What I don’t like is when you have people sort of taking out mortgages on their home, and putting themselves at risk if the thing collapsed,” he added. “You want to be able to invest what you can afford to lose if you’re going to play in something like this.” Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities, said the trading in names like GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond is one of the things that has made him more cautious about the market. He said the high valuations on the meme names are unlikely to last. “It’s going to be around as long as cicadas are,” he said. The S&P 500 in the past week gained 0.6%, rising to 4,229, just 9 points from its all-time high. The Dow was up 0.7% to 34,756, and the Nasdaq gained 0.5% to 13,814. Watching the inflation signs Massocca said investors should stay focused on things like inflation, since that could be what makes the Federal Reserve reverse its easy policy. The Fed has so far said it sees the higher inflation readings as transitory. Economists expect CPI to be up 4.7% year over year, after April’s 4.2% pace, according to Dow Jones. Core inflation is expected to be up 0.4% for the month and 3.4% year over year. “I’m getting nervous. I’m seeing signs of a top. I’m systematically raising cash. I think the market looks too expensive,” Massocca said. “We’re going to shake off the dust from Covid. The economy is going to be very, very good and as a rule, I think monetary policy is going to respond to some degree.” He said the memes mania is just one sign, but the spark for a sell-off could be anything including a hawkish comment from the Fed. “Who knows what it is, but the kindling is building and as soon as a match hits it, the market is setting up for a 7% to 10% pullback at some point,” he said. “Who knows what starts it. ... One of the candidates very likely will be some kind of reductions in monetary policy.” Fear of the Fed stepping back from its easy policy has been hanging over the market. Friday’s May employment report was being watched closely, but the lower-than-expected job gains reinforced that the Fed could continue to hold off on policy changes for the time being. There were 559,000 jobs added in May, well below the 671,000 expected. Now the CPI report is the next point of focus, ahead of the Fed’s June 15-16 meeting. The question is, will it be so hot that the central bank may have to reassess its view about the temporary nature of inflation, or could it show that price increases are peaking? “There’s inflation out there. You can see it everywhere,” said Massocca. Taper talk The market has been expecting the Fed to begin to talk about unwinding its bond buying later this year, with many strategists targeting the Fed’s Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium at the end of August. The Fed is expected to first discuss cutting back its purchases months ahead of taking action. Then it will slowly reduce its buying. After that, it could consider interest rate hikes, now not expected by the market until 2023. Niles said the meme stock trend has been fueled in part by the Fed. The markets are awash in liquidity as the central bank keeps rates at zero and maintains its monthly purchases of at least $120 billion in Treasury and mortgage securities. “When the Fed backs off of that with tapering, I think that’s when you can go in and say, ‘OK’ we can potentially go after and short some of these highly valued names because that’s when the free money disappears and you actually start to contract some of that free money,” he said. “That’s when things start to get dangerous to the downside.” For now, Niles said he’s staying away from the names that are heavily sought by retail investors or have large short interest and are targeted by Wall Street. “You want to stay away from this stuff now unless you’re doing it in very small size,” he said. There are just a few earnings in the week ahead. One of the handful of names reporting is meme name GameStop on Wednesday. Campbell Soup also reports that day, and Chewy reports Thursday. G-7 finance ministers meet this weekend, and President Joe Biden will attend a meeting of the organization’s leaders in Cornwall, England, on Friday.

May Payrolls Not Too Hot, Not Too Cold Before diving into today’s jobs report for May, it will be a useful exercise to recall the curveball that April’s report threw at investors. One of the more hotly contested topics investors have been debating recently is what to make of the jobs report released one month ago, where the consensus expectation was for 1,000,000 new jobs and we only got 266,000 (since revised up to 278,000). On the one hand, data releases are volatile by nature and it is possible that the large miss could have been broadly dismissed as a “one off” among a package of otherwise very healthy economic data. On the other hand, it did confirm anecdotal evidence of difficult hiring conditions facing companies and reinforced the notion that some workers may be reluctant to return to the workforce for a whole host of reasons. Moreover, if the April report really did unearth new evidence of a weaker-than-expected jobs market in this latter scenario, should we view the effect as temporary or does it have staying power that could spell new trouble for the overall economic recovery? Against this backdrop, investors were hoping that today’s May jobs report would go a long way towards providing some definitive answers to these important questions. It did not. But, that might actually be a good thing. Here are some key takeaways: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ May employment report revealed that the domestic economy added 559,000 jobs in May, slightly below Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ median forecast for a gain of 675,000. The prior two months also received net positive revisions of 27,000 jobs. The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 5.8%, though that was paired with a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate, which moved from 61.7% to 61.6%. Average hourly earnings rose 0.5% month over month, again signaling lower-wage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected. More new lower-wage jobs would be expected to put more downward pressure on wage increases. “It is hard to view 559,000 added jobs as a disappointment, but it does leave something to be desired,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market > Strategist Ryan Detrick. “There is strong potential for job prints in excess of one million over the coming months, but the truth is as strong as the economy is right now, the employment backdrop is clearly lagging what we were all expecting just a few months ago.” As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, May’s jobs number did jump above April’s disappointment, but still came well short of making a fresh new high for 2021. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Where do we go from here? The US economy is still 7.6 million total payrolls shy of its peak prior to the recession, and given the magnitude of that number, we still believe there is the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months. Several catalysts should also lend a helping hand in the near future. Enhanced unemployment benefits may be deterring lower-wage workers from returning to the labor market, as they reduce the relative attractiveness of a paycheck from an employer. In the last month, about half of all states have started eliminating these added benefits in order to reduce the disincentive. We believe this should show up in the data starting with the June employment report. Also, schools might be closing for the summer, but daycare centers are reopening more broadly, freeing parents up to find jobs. Warmer weather, ever-improving vaccination trends, and increasing comfort reengaging in normal activities should all play their parts as well. The labor market will always be inextricably linked to the inflation outlook, this cycle perhaps more than past cycles, and for many that is the real story today. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has made it clear it will tolerate near-term inflation overshoots in order to achieve “substantial further progress” towards its employment goals before it begins taking measures to combat higher inflation. Recent hotter-than-expected inflation reports have increasingly turned the spotlight towards the Fed’s timeline for reducing their asset purchases, which, given their stated position, will depend on strong payroll reports. As such, we find ourselves (to a degree) in a “good news is bad news” scenario, as strong labor market readings could hasten the Fed’s timetable to begin normalizing monetary policy. Today’s report likely did little to convince the Fed that the labor market is closer to meeting its “substantial further progress” goal on employment, and therefore, all else equal, will not compel them to consider reducing asset purchases sooner rather than later. There is much ground still to be made up in the labor market, and we believe the Fed will need to see a string of strong reports, likely in the one million range, before it begins to take action. From a Fed intervention standpoint, today’s employment report likely found a sweet spot, and the early indications are that equity markets are breathing a sigh of relief. For a deeper dive into the inflation picture, check the blog on Thursday, June 10, when data for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation is set to be released. Big First 5 Months Gains Consolidate Over Worst Months S&P 500 is up an impressive 11.9% for the first five months of 2021. That is the 16th best gain for the first five months since 1950. As illustrated in the graph above, gains do beget gains and this bodes well for the year as a whole. But this does not diminish the seasonal pattern of consolidation and mostly sideways market action over the Worst Six Months May-October and even more so over the Worst Four Months July-October. We tabulated the gains for the top 20 first five month gains since 1950 and the gains for the last seven months of the year are still pretty solid averaging 9.4% vs. 14.7% for the top 20 first five months. But the bulk of those gains as you can see in the graph come from late-October to yearend. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) June Swoon?

According to Sam Stovall of CFRA, only 5 market declines in excess of 5% started in June versus an average of 8 for all 12 months (since WWII). In other words, it isn’t common for major market weakness to start in June. Building on this, when the S&P 500 is lower in June, it is down by 2.9% on average. This is the second smallest average loss, with only December better at -2.5%. We wouldn’t be surprised at all if stocks took a well-deserved break in June, but this month is rather misunderstood, as a massive sell-off or the start of significant weakness isn’t likely, as that isn’t what June typically brings. Lastly, last Wednesday marked the 100th trading day of the year for the S&P 500. In fact, the S&P 500 was up more than 10% on the 100th day, which historically is a great start to the year, but also has meant continued strong performance the rest of the year is quite normal. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when stocks are up more than 10% on day 100, the rest of the year has been higher 84.2% of the time and up 8.6% on average, both well above what the average year does. We continue to recommend an overweight to equities and underweight to fixed-income position relative to investors’ targets, as appropriate. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!)

In the most recent Beige Book, “strong” words were near their highest since we first began tracking data in 2005 while weak words were their lowest on record, resulting in the strongest overall sentiment reading since inception. The strong reading is likely driven more by a change in direction than in overall activity, but even that is a welcome shift. “The country and the economy are going through a disruptive but positive change as most COVID-related restrictions are lifted and the economy reopens,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Sentiment is up and that’s a great sign for the direction of the economy.” (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) This was an important Beige Book in other ways. Mentions of COVID-related words (virus, COVID, pandemic) fell to their lowest level since the March 2020 Beige Book, when the words first started to appear. More concerning, words related to inflation also rose to their highest level since our earliest analysis. The downside of the economy’s rapid acceleration has been a mismatch between demand, which can ramp up quickly, and supply, which comes on line more slowly, while labor markets have also been slow to keep pace with reopening. Overall, the fundamental backdrop for the economy remains positive. Supply chain disruptions can slow the pace of the economic rebound but are likely temporary, while we expect reopening to be enduring. There is still some risk around variants, however, and full supply chain relief will likely need support from accelerated global vaccine distribution. US economic acceleration will probably peak in the second quarter, but there’s still plenty of scope for growth to moderate and still remain above average. Much of the positive news is already priced in for equity markets, which are forward looking, and gains may not come as easily, but we still see solid potential for upside as the economy continues to rebound. S&P 500 Returns Relative to History May has moved back to the rearview mirror and with that, we wanted to provide an update on how current long-term returns for the S&P 500 stack up relative to history. The chart below compares the trailing one, two, five, ten, and twenty-year annualized total returns of the S&P 500 to the S&P 500's historical average returns over those same time periods since 1928. We're starting to move away from the 'easy comps' in terms of market returns relative to the March 2020 lows, but the S&P 500 is still up more than 40% over the last 12 months which is nearly four times the historical average one year return. Over the last two years, the S&P 500's annualized return of 25.8% still comes in at more than twice the historical average of 10.6%. On a five and ten-year basis, the S&P 500's annualized gain also remains comfortably above 10%. All in all, the last decade has been very good for US equity investors. The only time period where the S&P 500 has experienced below-average returns is at the 20-year window where the 8.4% annualized gain clocks in at 2.5 percentage less than the historical average of 10.9%. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) The chart below compares the S&P 500's current returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to all other periods on a percentile basis. With mostly above-average returns, it comes as no surprise that most of the percentile readings rank above the 50th percentile, and for most time periods, the percentile rank comes in well above 50%. The one-year total return of more than 40% actually ranks just above the 93rd percentile, while the two-year return isn't far from the 90th percentile either. Moving further out, each of the other readings going out to ten years are all well above the 50th percentile. The only percentile rank below the 50th percentile is the 20-year window and that reading isn't even close. On the one hand, the last ten years have been phenomenal for equity investors, but the last 20 years haven't even been mediocre. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Throughout history, many investors have always worked under the assumption that long-term returns for the equity market are about 10%. History has shown that to be the case over the last decade at least, as the average annualized one-year gain of the S&P 500 has been well above 10%. With the S&P 500's current 20-year annualized gain currently at just 8.4%, though, what will it take for the S&P 500 to reach double-digit gains on an annualized basis over a 20-year window? For an idea, given the strong performance of the last ten years, a number of commentators suggest that the next ten years for equities will be weak with a reversion to the mean. Only time will tell, but if we operate under the (unlikely) assumption that the S&P 500 stays at the exact same level it is now going forward for the next ten years, its annualized twenty-year return would top 10% for the first time since August 2008 next September. After that brief period above 10% from September 2022 through March 2023, it wouldn't again top that level until February 2029. In spite of the fact that the annualized 20-year return would top 10% in those two periods, though, it still wouldn't get as high as the historical average of 10.9% in either of those periods. This reflects the fact that although the last ten years for US equities have been very strong, they also came shortly after one of the worst ten-year periods for US equities on record.

,"Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 7th, 2021. AMC, meme stocks could spark more heat in the week ahead as investors await inflation news - (Source) Inflation data is a highlight of the week ahead, as investors focus on economic news in the void between earnings season and the next Fed meeting. May’s consumer price index is scheduled to be reported Thursday, and it could be hot after it surged in April. Inflation is viewed as an important trigger that could cause the Federal Reserve to step back from its easy policies, if rising prices appear to be hotter and more persistent than expected. Equities were higher in the past week, but the meme stocks were far hotter. AMC Entertainment gained another 100% and was up 2,700% since January. Energy was the best-performing major sector, gaining more than 6.7% as oil prices jumped nearly 5% in the past week. REITs were the second-best performer, up 3.1%, followed by financials, up 1.2% and technology, also up 1.2%. But it’s the meme stocks that took the headlines, and also contributed to concerns about froth in the stock market. “People think this is new. It completely isn’t,” Dan Niles, founder of Satori Fund, said of the trading frenzy. He noted there was similar froth in individual stocks in 1999, when companies added dot-com to their names to attract investor attention. “What’s new is the fact that these traders are armed with stimulus checks. They can organize more easily on things like WallStreetBets, they can work from home, and there’s no-cost trading. Those are the differences,” Niles said on CNBC. “So, if it gets people interested in investing, that’s great. What I don’t like is when you have people sort of taking out mortgages on their home, and putting themselves at risk if the thing collapsed,” he added. “You want to be able to invest what you can afford to lose if you’re going to play in something like this.” Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities, said the trading in names like GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond is one of the things that has made him more cautious about the market. He said the high valuations on the meme names are unlikely to last. “It’s going to be around as long as cicadas are,” he said. The S&P 500 in the past week gained 0.6%, rising to 4,229, just 9 points from its all-time high. The Dow was up 0.7% to 34,756, and the Nasdaq gained 0.5% to 13,814. Watching the inflation signs Massocca said investors should stay focused on things like inflation, since that could be what makes the Federal Reserve reverse its easy policy. The Fed has so far said it sees the higher inflation readings as transitory. Economists expect CPI to be up 4.7% year over year, after April’s 4.2% pace, according to Dow Jones. Core inflation is expected to be up 0.4% for the month and 3.4% year over year. “I’m getting nervous. I’m seeing signs of a top. I’m systematically raising cash. I think the market looks too expensive,” Massocca said. “We’re going to shake off the dust from Covid. The economy is going to be very, very good and as a rule, I think monetary policy is going to respond to some degree.” He said the memes mania is just one sign, but the spark for a sell-off could be anything including a hawkish comment from the Fed. “Who knows what it is, but the kindling is building and as soon as a match hits it, the market is setting up for a 7% to 10% pullback at some point,” he said. “Who knows what starts it. ... One of the candidates very likely will be some kind of reductions in monetary policy.” Fear of the Fed stepping back from its easy policy has been hanging over the market. Friday’s May employment report was being watched closely, but the lower-than-expected job gains reinforced that the Fed could continue to hold off on policy changes for the time being. There were 559,000 jobs added in May, well below the 671,000 expected. Now the CPI report is the next point of focus, ahead of the Fed’s June 15-16 meeting. The question is, will it be so hot that the central bank may have to reassess its view about the temporary nature of inflation, or could it show that price increases are peaking? “There’s inflation out there. You can see it everywhere,” said Massocca. Taper talk The market has been expecting the Fed to begin to talk about unwinding its bond buying later this year, with many strategists targeting the Fed’s Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium at the end of August. The Fed is expected to first discuss cutting back its purchases months ahead of taking action. Then it will slowly reduce its buying. After that, it could consider interest rate hikes, now not expected by the market until 2023. Niles said the meme stock trend has been fueled in part by the Fed. The markets are awash in liquidity as the central bank keeps rates at zero and maintains its monthly purchases of at least $120 billion in Treasury and mortgage securities. “When the Fed backs off of that with tapering, I think that’s when you can go in and say, ‘OK’ we can potentially go after and short some of these highly valued names because that’s when the free money disappears and you actually start to contract some of that free money,” he said. “That’s when things start to get dangerous to the downside.” For now, Niles said he’s staying away from the names that are heavily sought by retail investors or have large short interest and are targeted by Wall Street. “You want to stay away from this stuff now unless you’re doing it in very small size,” he said. There are just a few earnings in the week ahead. One of the handful of names reporting is meme name GameStop on Wednesday. Campbell Soup also reports that day, and Chewy reports Thursday. G-7 finance ministers meet this weekend, and President Joe Biden will attend a meeting of the organization’s leaders in Cornwall, England, on Friday.

May Payrolls Not Too Hot, Not Too Cold Before diving into today’s jobs report for May, it will be a useful exercise to recall the curveball that April’s report threw at investors. One of the more hotly contested topics investors have been debating recently is what to make of the jobs report released one month ago, where the consensus expectation was for 1,000,000 new jobs and we only got 266,000 (since revised up to 278,000). On the one hand, data releases are volatile by nature and it is possible that the large miss could have been broadly dismissed as a “one off” among a package of otherwise very healthy economic data. On the other hand, it did confirm anecdotal evidence of difficult hiring conditions facing companies and reinforced the notion that some workers may be reluctant to return to the workforce for a whole host of reasons. Moreover, if the April report really did unearth new evidence of a weaker-than-expected jobs market in this latter scenario, should we view the effect as temporary or does it have staying power that could spell new trouble for the overall economic recovery? Against this backdrop, investors were hoping that today’s May jobs report would go a long way towards providing some definitive answers to these important questions. It did not. But, that might actually be a good thing. Here are some key takeaways: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ May employment report revealed that the domestic economy added 559,000 jobs in May, slightly below Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ median forecast for a gain of 675,000. The prior two months also received net positive revisions of 27,000 jobs. The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 5.8%, though that was paired with a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate, which moved from 61.7% to 61.6%. Average hourly earnings rose 0.5% month over month, again signaling lower-wage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected. More new lower-wage jobs would be expected to put more downward pressure on wage increases. “It is hard to view 559,000 added jobs as a disappointment, but it does leave something to be desired,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market > Strategist Ryan Detrick. “There is strong potential for job prints in excess of one million over the coming months, but the truth is as strong as the economy is right now, the employment backdrop is clearly lagging what we were all expecting just a few months ago.” As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, May’s jobs number did jump above April’s disappointment, but still came well short of making a fresh new high for 2021. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Where do we go from here? The US economy is still 7.6 million total payrolls shy of its peak prior to the recession, and given the magnitude of that number, we still believe there is the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months. Several catalysts should also lend a helping hand in the near future. Enhanced unemployment benefits may be deterring lower-wage workers from returning to the labor market, as they reduce the relative attractiveness of a paycheck from an employer. In the last month, about half of all states have started eliminating these added benefits in order to reduce the disincentive. We believe this should show up in the data starting with the June employment report. Also, schools might be closing for the summer, but daycare centers are reopening more broadly, freeing parents up to find jobs. Warmer weather, ever-improving vaccination trends, and increasing comfort reengaging in normal activities should all play their parts as well. The labor market will always be inextricably linked to the inflation outlook, this cycle perhaps more than past cycles, and for many that is the real story today. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has made it clear it will tolerate near-term inflation overshoots in order to achieve “substantial further progress” towards its employment goals before it begins taking measures to combat higher inflation. Recent hotter-than-expected inflation reports have increasingly turned the spotlight towards the Fed’s timeline for reducing their asset purchases, which, given their stated position, will depend on strong payroll reports. As such, we find ourselves (to a degree) in a “good news is bad news” scenario, as strong labor market readings could hasten the Fed’s timetable to begin normalizing monetary policy. Today’s report likely did little to convince the Fed that the labor market is closer to meeting its “substantial further progress” goal on employment, and therefore, all else equal, will not compel them to consider reducing asset purchases sooner rather than later. There is much ground still to be made up in the labor market, and we believe the Fed will need to see a string of strong reports, likely in the one million range, before it begins to take action. From a Fed intervention standpoint, today’s employment report likely found a sweet spot, and the early indications are that equity markets are breathing a sigh of relief. For a deeper dive into the inflation picture, check the blog on Thursday, June 10, when data for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation is set to be released. Big First 5 Months Gains Consolidate Over Worst Months S&P 500 is up an impressive 11.9% for the first five months of 2021. That is the 16th best gain for the first five months since 1950. As illustrated in the graph above, gains do beget gains and this bodes well for the year as a whole. But this does not diminish the seasonal pattern of consolidation and mostly sideways market action over the Worst Six Months May-October and even more so over the Worst Four Months July-October. We tabulated the gains for the top 20 first five month gains since 1950 and the gains for the last seven months of the year are still pretty solid averaging 9.4% vs. 14.7% for the top 20 first five months. But the bulk of those gains as you can see in the graph come from late-October to yearend. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) June Swoon? Although there was some notable weakness in the middle of May, the S&P 500 Index was able to rally late in the month to finish with a modest gain. Incredibly, this was the eighth year out of the past nine that stocks gained during in May. Who said Sell in May? (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) As we noted a month ago, the worst six months of the year indeed are May through October, so we are still in the thick of a potentially challenging period based on seasonality. “After a nearly 90% rally off the lows, stocks could be ripe for a pullback, especially during the historically weak month of June,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But with the improving economy, coupled with historic fiscal and monetary stimulus, we expect any weakness to be short-lived.” (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Here are some stats to think about regarding S&P 500 performance in June: Since 1950, June is the 4th worst month of the year (September, February, and August are worse). It has been higher the past 5 years in a row, the longest since a stretch of 6 in a row in the late 1990s. The past 10 years, though, June was up 1.0% on average, ranking as the 7th best month. According to Sam Stovall of CFRA, only 5 market declines in excess of 5% started in June versus an average of 8 for all 12 months (since WWII). In other words, it isn’t common for major market weakness to start in June. Building on this, when the S&P 500 is lower in June, it is down by 2.9% on average. This is the second smallest average loss, with only December better at -2.5%. We wouldn’t be surprised at all if stocks took a well-deserved break in June, but this month is rather misunderstood, as a massive sell-off or the start of significant weakness isn’t likely, as that isn’t what June typically brings. Lastly, last Wednesday marked the 100th trading day of the year for the S&P 500. In fact, the S&P 500 was up more than 10% on the 100th day, which historically is a great start to the year, but also has meant continued strong performance the rest of the year is quite normal. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when stocks are up more than 10% on day 100, the rest of the year has been higher 84.2% of the time and up 8.6% on average, both well above what the average year does. We continue to recommend an overweight to equities and underweight to fixed-income position relative to investors’ targets, as appropriate. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Less Than 20% Bearish For the First Time in 115 Weeks Bullish sentiment measured through the AAII weekly survey was at the lowest level since the fall last week, but after jumping 7.7 percentage points, it is now at the highest level since the end of April. Not only is it high relative to the past few weeks, but the increase also brings bullish sentiment 6 percentage points back above its historical average. Additionally, the week over week increase was the largest since the week of April 8th when the reading had risen 11.1 percentage points. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) In recent weeks, neutral sentiment had been surging; topping 37% last week for the highest reading since the first week of 2020. Although it reversed lower this week down to 36.2%, neutral sentiment remains around some of the strongest levels in over a year. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) With the pickup in bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment plummeted to 19.8% on a 6.6 percentage point decile; the largest since February. Falling below 20%, bearish sentiment took out its March and April lows and is now at the lowest level since January 2018. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Not only is that one of the lowest readings in bearish sentiment in recent history, but that drop below 20% brought to an end a 115-week long streak of readings in bearish sentiment above that level. As shown below, that surpassed a three-week shorter streak ending in December 2017 to make for the second-longest such streak on record. The longest streak which ended in December 2010 went on for more than twice as long as this most recent run. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Historically, lower readings in bearish sentiment have tended towards weaker performance for the S&P 500 going forward as shown below. But when it comes to the past times that bearish sentiment has broken below 20% for the first time in at least 50 weeks, performance has actually tended to consistently be positive. In fact, across each of the past six instances, the S&P 500 has been higher six months out every time. Granted, for the most part the typical move higher is usually smaller than other periods. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Typical June Trading: Any Early Gains Tend to Fade Especially After Mid-Month Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-caps. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!)

S&P 500 Returns Relative to History May has moved back to the rearview mirror and with that, we wanted to provide an update on how current long-term returns for the S&P 500 stack up relative to history. The chart below compares the trailing one, two, five, ten, and twenty-year annualized total returns of the S&P 500 to the S&P 500's historical average returns over those same time periods since 1928. We're starting to move away from the 'easy comps' in terms of market returns relative to the March 2020 lows, but the S&P 500 is still up more than 40% over the last 12 months which is nearly four times the historical average one year return. Over the last two years, the S&P 500's annualized return of 25.8% still comes in at more than twice the historical average of 10.6%. On a five and ten-year basis, the S&P 500's annualized gain also remains comfortably above 10%. All in all, the last decade has been very good for US equity investors. The only time period where the S&P 500 has experienced below-average returns is at the 20-year window where the 8.4% annualized gain clocks in at 2.5 percentage less than the historical average of 10.9%. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) The chart below compares the S&P 500's current returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to all other periods on a percentile basis.

Moving further out, each of the other readings going out to ten years are all well above the 50th percentile.

With the S&P 500's current 20-year annualized gain currently at just 8.4%, though, what will it take for the S&P 500 to reach double-digit gains on an annualized basis over a 20-year window?

This reflects the fact that although the last ten years for US equities have been very strong, they also came shortly after one of the worst ten-year periods for US equities on record.

,"Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 7th, 2021. AMC, meme stocks could spark more heat in the week ahead as investors await inflation news - (Source) Inflation data is a highlight of the week ahead, as investors focus on economic news in the void between earnings season and the next Fed meeting. May’s consumer price index is scheduled to be reported Thursday, and it could be hot after it surged in April. Inflation is viewed as an important trigger that could cause the Federal Reserve to step back from its easy policies, if rising prices appear to be hotter and more persistent than expected. Equities were higher in the past week, but the meme stocks were far hotter. AMC Entertainment gained another 100% and was up 2,700% since January. Energy was the best-performing major sector, gaining more than 6.7% as oil prices jumped nearly 5% in the past week. REITs were the second-best performer, up 3.1%, followed by financials, up 1.2% and technology, also up 1.2%. But it’s the meme stocks that took the headlines, and also contributed to concerns about froth in the stock market. “People think this is new. It completely isn’t,” Dan Niles, founder of Satori Fund, said of the trading frenzy. He noted there was similar froth in individual stocks in 1999, when companies added dot-com to their names to attract investor attention. “What’s new is the fact that these traders are armed with stimulus checks. They can organize more easily on things like WallStreetBets, they can work from home, and there’s no-cost trading. Those are the differences,” Niles said on CNBC. “So, if it gets people interested in investing, that’s great. What I don’t like is when you have people sort of taking out mortgages on their home, and putting themselves at risk if the thing collapsed,” he added. “You want to be able to invest what you can afford to lose if you’re going to play in something like this.” Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities, said the trading in names like GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond is one of the things that has made him more cautious about the market. He said the high valuations on the meme names are unlikely to last. “It’s going to be around as long as cicadas are,” he said. The S&P 500 in the past week gained 0.6%, rising to 4,229, just 9 points from its all-time high. The Dow was up 0.7% to 34,756, and the Nasdaq gained 0.5% to 13,814. Watching the inflation signs Massocca said investors should stay focused on things like inflation, since that could be what makes the Federal Reserve reverse its easy policy. The Fed has so far said it sees the higher inflation readings as transitory. Economists expect CPI to be up 4.7% year over year, after April’s 4.2% pace, according to Dow Jones. Core inflation is expected to be up 0.4% for the month and 3.4% year over year. “I’m getting nervous. I’m seeing signs of a top. I’m systematically raising cash. I think the market looks too expensive,” Massocca said. “We’re going to shake off the dust from Covid. The economy is going to be very, very good and as a rule, I think monetary policy is going to respond to some degree.” He said the memes mania is just one sign, but the spark for a sell-off could be anything including a hawkish comment from the Fed. “Who knows what it is, but the kindling is building and as soon as a match hits it, the market is setting up for a 7% to 10% pullback at some point,” he said. “Who knows what starts it. ... One of the candidates very likely will be some kind of reductions in monetary policy.” Fear of the Fed stepping back from its easy policy has been hanging over the market. Friday’s May employment report was being watched closely, but the lower-than-expected job gains reinforced that the Fed could continue to hold off on policy changes for the time being. There were 559,000 jobs added in May, well below the 671,000 expected. Now the CPI report is the next point of focus, ahead of the Fed’s June 15-16 meeting. The question is, will it be so hot that the central bank may have to reassess its view about the temporary nature of inflation, or could it show that price increases are peaking? “There’s inflation out there. You can see it everywhere,” said Massocca. Taper talk The market has been expecting the Fed to begin to talk about unwinding its bond buying later this year, with many strategists targeting the Fed’s Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium at the end of August. The Fed is expected to first discuss cutting back its purchases months ahead of taking action. Then it will slowly reduce its buying. After that, it could consider interest rate hikes, now not expected by the market until 2023. Niles said the meme stock trend has been fueled in part by the Fed. The markets are awash in liquidity as the central bank keeps rates at zero and maintains its monthly purchases of at least $120 billion in Treasury and mortgage securities. “When the Fed backs off of that with tapering, I think that’s when you can go in and say, ‘OK’ we can potentially go after and short some of these highly valued names because that’s when the free money disappears and you actually start to contract some of that free money,” he said. “That’s when things start to get dangerous to the downside.” For now, Niles said he’s staying away from the names that are heavily sought by retail investors or have large short interest and are targeted by Wall Street. “You want to stay away from this stuff now unless you’re doing it in very small size,” he said. There are just a few earnings in the week ahead. One of the handful of names reporting is meme name GameStop on Wednesday. Campbell Soup also reports that day, and Chewy reports Thursday. G-7 finance ministers meet this weekend, and President Joe Biden will attend a meeting of the organization’s leaders in Cornwall, England, on Friday.

May Payrolls Not Too Hot, Not Too Cold Before diving into today’s jobs report for May, it will be a useful exercise to recall the curveball that April’s report threw at investors. One of the more hotly contested topics investors have been debating recently is what to make of the jobs report released one month ago, where the consensus expectation was for 1,000,000 new jobs and we only got 266,000 (since revised up to 278,000). On the one hand, data releases are volatile by nature and it is possible that the large miss could have been broadly dismissed as a “one off” among a package of otherwise very healthy economic data. On the other hand, it did confirm anecdotal evidence of difficult hiring conditions facing companies and reinforced the notion that some workers may be reluctant to return to the workforce for a whole host of reasons. Moreover, if the April report really did unearth new evidence of a weaker-than-expected jobs market in this latter scenario, should we view the effect as temporary or does it have staying power that could spell new trouble for the overall economic recovery? Against this backdrop, investors were hoping that today’s May jobs report would go a long way towards providing some definitive answers to these important questions. It did not. But, that might actually be a good thing. Here are some key takeaways: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ May employment report revealed that the domestic economy added 559,000 jobs in May, slightly below Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ median forecast for a gain of 675,000. The prior two months also received net positive revisions of 27,000 jobs. The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 5.8%, though that was paired with a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate, which moved from 61.7% to 61.6%. Average hourly earnings rose 0.5% month over month, again signaling lower-wage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected. More new lower-wage jobs would be expected to put more downward pressure on wage increases. “It is hard to view 559,000 added jobs as a disappointment, but it does leave something to be desired,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market > Strategist Ryan Detrick. “There is strong potential for job prints in excess of one million over the coming months, but the truth is as strong as the economy is right now, the employment backdrop is clearly lagging what we were all expecting just a few months ago.” As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, May’s jobs number did jump above April’s disappointment, but still came well short of making a fresh new high for 2021. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Where do we go from here? The US economy is still 7.6 million total payrolls shy of its peak prior to the recession, and given the magnitude of that number, we still believe there is the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months. Several catalysts should also lend a helping hand in the near future. Enhanced unemployment benefits may be deterring lower-wage workers from returning to the labor market, as they reduce the relative attractiveness of a paycheck from an employer. In the last month, about half of all states have started eliminating these added benefits in order to reduce the disincentive. We believe this should show up in the data starting with the June employment report. Also, schools might be closing for the summer, but daycare centers are reopening more broadly, freeing parents up to find jobs. Warmer weather, ever-improving vaccination trends, and increasing comfort reengaging in normal activities should all play their parts as well. The labor market will always be inextricably linked to the inflation outlook, this cycle perhaps more than past cycles, and for many that is the real story today. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has made it clear it will tolerate near-term inflation overshoots in order to achieve “substantial further progress” towards its employment goals before it begins taking measures to combat higher inflation. Recent hotter-than-expected inflation reports have increasingly turned the spotlight towards the Fed’s timeline for reducing their asset purchases, which, given their stated position, will depend on strong payroll reports. As such, we find ourselves (to a degree) in a “good news is bad news” scenario, as strong labor market readings could hasten the Fed’s timetable to begin normalizing monetary policy. Today’s report likely did little to convince the Fed that the labor market is closer to meeting its “substantial further progress” goal on employment, and therefore, all else equal, will not compel them to consider reducing asset purchases sooner rather than later. There is much ground still to be made up in the labor market, and we believe the Fed will need to see a string of strong reports, likely in the one million range, before it begins to take action. From a Fed intervention standpoint, today’s employment report likely found a sweet spot, and the early indications are that equity markets are breathing a sigh of relief. For a deeper dive into the inflation picture, check the blog on Thursday, June 10, when data for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation is set to be released. Big First 5 Months Gains Consolidate Over Worst Months S&P 500 is up an impressive 11.9% for the first five months of 2021. That is the 16th best gain for the first five months since 1950. As illustrated in the graph above, gains do beget gains and this bodes well for the year as a whole. But this does not diminish the seasonal pattern of consolidation and mostly sideways market action over the Worst Six Months May-October and even more so over the Worst Four Months July-October. We tabulated the gains for the top 20 first five month gains since 1950 and the gains for the last seven months of the year are still pretty solid averaging 9.4% vs. 14.7% for the top 20 first five months. But the bulk of those gains as you can see in the graph come from late-October to yearend. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) June Swoon? Although there was some notable weakness in the middle of May, the S&P 500 Index was able to rally late in the month to finish with a modest gain. Incredibly, this was the eighth year out of the past nine that stocks gained during in May. Who said Sell in May? (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) As we noted a month ago, the worst six months of the year indeed are May through October, so we are still in the thick of a potentially challenging period based on seasonality. “After a nearly 90% rally off the lows, stocks could be ripe for a pullback, especially during the historically weak month of June,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But with the improving economy, coupled with historic fiscal and monetary stimulus, we expect any weakness to be short-lived.” (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Here are some stats to think about regarding S&P 500 performance in June: Since 1950, June is the 4th worst month of the year (September, February, and August are worse). It has been higher the past 5 years in a row, the longest since a stretch of 6 in a row in the late 1990s. The past 10 years, though, June was up 1.0% on average, ranking as the 7th best month. According to Sam Stovall of CFRA, only 5 market declines in excess of 5% started in June versus an average of 8 for all 12 months (since WWII). In other words, it isn’t common for major market weakness to start in June. Building on this, when the S&P 500 is lower in June, it is down by 2.9% on average. This is the second smallest average loss, with only December better at -2.5%. We wouldn’t be surprised at all if stocks took a well-deserved break in June, but this month is rather misunderstood, as a massive sell-off or the start of significant weakness isn’t likely, as that isn’t what June typically brings. Lastly, last Wednesday marked the 100th trading day of the year for the S&P 500. In fact, the S&P 500 was up more than 10% on the 100th day, which historically is a great start to the year, but also has meant continued strong performance the rest of the year is quite normal. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when stocks are up more than 10% on day 100, the rest of the year has been higher 84.2% of the time and up 8.6% on average, both well above what the average year does. We continue to recommend an overweight to equities and underweight to fixed-income position relative to investors’ targets, as appropriate. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Less Than 20% Bearish For the First Time in 115 Weeks Bullish sentiment measured through the AAII weekly survey was at the lowest level since the fall last week, but after jumping 7.7 percentage points, it is now at the highest level since the end of April. Not only is it high relative to the past few weeks, but the increase also brings bullish sentiment 6 percentage points back above its historical average. Additionally, the week over week increase was the largest since the week of April 8th when the reading had risen 11.1 percentage points. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) In recent weeks, neutral sentiment had been surging; topping 37% last week for the highest reading since the first week of 2020. Although it reversed lower this week down to 36.2%, neutral sentiment remains around some of the strongest levels in over a year. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) With the pickup in bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment plummeted to 19.8% on a 6.6 percentage point decile; the largest since February. Falling below 20%, bearish sentiment took out its March and April lows and is now at the lowest level since January 2018. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Not only is that one of the lowest readings in bearish sentiment in recent history, but that drop below 20% brought to an end a 115-week long streak of readings in bearish sentiment above that level. As shown below, that surpassed a three-week shorter streak ending in December 2017 to make for the second-longest such streak on record. The longest streak which ended in December 2010 went on for more than twice as long as this most recent run. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Historically, lower readings in bearish sentiment have tended towards weaker performance for the S&P 500 going forward as shown below. But when it comes to the past times that bearish sentiment has broken below 20% for the first time in at least 50 weeks, performance has actually tended to consistently be positive. In fact, across each of the past six instances, the S&P 500 has been higher six months out every time. Granted, for the most part the typical move higher is usually smaller than other periods. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Typical June Trading: Any Early Gains Tend to Fade Especially After Mid-Month Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-caps. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Main Street Sentiment Strongest in Over a Decade The U.S. economy is opening up and overall sentiment on Main Street is the strongest it’s been since our earliest analysis in 2005, according to LPL Research’s proprietary Beige Book Barometer (BBB). The result is based on our analysis of the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, a publication released two weeks before each Fed policy meeting that captures qualitative observations made by community bankers and business owners—what we like to think of as “Main Street” rather than “Wall Street.” The BBB gauges Main Street’s sentiment by looking at how frequently key words and phrases appear in the text. In the most recent Beige Book, “strong” words were near their highest since we first began tracking data in 2005 while weak words were their lowest on record, resulting in the strongest overall sentiment reading since inception. The strong reading is likely driven more by a change in direction than in overall activity, but even that is a welcome shift. “The country and the economy are going through a disruptive but positive change as most COVID-related restrictions are lifted and the economy reopens,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Sentiment is up and that’s a great sign for the direction of the economy.” (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) This was an important Beige Book in other ways. Mentions of COVID-related words (virus, COVID, pandemic) fell to their lowest level since the March 2020 Beige Book, when the words first started to appear. More concerning, words related to inflation also rose to their highest level since our earliest analysis. The downside of the economy’s rapid acceleration has been a mismatch between demand, which can ramp up quickly, and supply, which comes on line more slowly, while labor markets have also been slow to keep pace with reopening. Overall, the fundamental backdrop for the economy remains positive. Supply chain disruptions can slow the pace of the economic rebound but are likely temporary, while we expect reopening to be enduring. There is still some risk around variants, however, and full supply chain relief will likely need support from accelerated global vaccine distribution. US economic acceleration will probably peak in the second quarter, but there’s still plenty of scope for growth to moderate and still remain above average. Much of the positive news is already priced in for equity markets, which are forward looking, and gains may not come as easily, but we still see solid potential for upside as the economy continues to rebound. S&P 500 Returns Relative to History May has moved back to the rearview mirror and with that, we wanted to provide an update on how current long-term returns for the S&P 500 stack up relative to history. The chart below compares the trailing one, two, five, ten, and twenty-year annualized total returns of the S&P 500 to the S&P 500's historical average returns over those same time periods since 1928. We're starting to move away from the 'easy comps' in terms of market returns relative to the March 2020 lows, but the S&P 500 is still up more than 40% over the last 12 months which is nearly four times the historical average one year return. Over the last two years, the S&P 500's annualized return of 25.8% still comes in at more than twice the historical average of 10.6%. On a five and ten-year basis, the S&P 500's annualized gain also remains comfortably above 10%. All in all, the last decade has been very good for US equity investors. The only time period where the S&P 500 has experienced below-average returns is at the 20-year window where the 8.4% annualized gain clocks in at 2.5 percentage less than the historical average of 10.9%. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) The chart below compares the S&P 500's current returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to all other periods on a percentile basis. With mostly above-average returns, it comes as no surprise that most of the percentile readings rank above the 50th percentile, and for most time periods, the percentile rank comes in well above 50%. The one-year total return of more than 40% actually ranks just above the 93rd percentile, while the two-year return isn't far from the 90th percentile either. Moving further out, each of the other readings going out to ten years are all well above the 50th percentile. The only percentile rank below the 50th percentile is the 20-year window and that reading isn't even close. On the one hand, the last ten years have been phenomenal for equity investors, but the last 20 years haven't even been mediocre. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Throughout history, many investors have always worked under the assumption that long-term returns for the equity market are about 10%. History has shown that to be the case over the last decade at least, as the average annualized one-year gain of the S&P 500 has been well above 10%. With the S&P 500's current 20-year annualized gain currently at just 8.4%, though, what will it take for the S&P 500 to reach double-digit gains on an annualized basis over a 20-year window? For an idea, given the strong performance of the last ten years, a number of commentators suggest that the next ten years for equities will be weak with a reversion to the mean. Only time will tell, but if we operate under the (unlikely) assumption that the S&P 500 stays at the exact same level it is now going forward for the next ten years, its annualized twenty-year return would top 10% for the first time since August 2008 next September. After that brief period above 10% from September 2022 through March 2023, it wouldn't again top that level until February 2029. In spite of the fact that the annualized 20-year return would top 10% in those two periods, though, it still wouldn't get as high as the historical average of 10.9% in either of those periods. This reflects the fact that although the last ten years for US equities have been very strong, they also came shortly after one of the worst ten-year periods for US equities on record.

Taper talk The market has been expecting the Fed to begin to talk about unwinding its bond buying later this year, with many strategists targeting the Fed’s Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium at the end of August. The Fed is expected to first discuss cutting back its purchases months ahead of taking action. Then it will slowly reduce its buying. After that, it could consider interest rate hikes, now not expected by the market until 2023. Niles said the meme stock trend has been fueled in part by the Fed. The markets are awash in liquidity as the central bank keeps rates at zero and maintains its monthly purchases of at least $120 billion in Treasury and mortgage securities. “When the Fed backs off of that with tapering, I think that’s when you can go in and say, ‘OK’ we can potentially go after and short some of these highly valued names because that’s when the free money disappears and you actually start to contract some of that free money,” he said. “That’s when things start to get dangerous to the downside.” For now, Niles said he’s staying away from the names that are heavily sought by retail investors or have large short interest and are targeted by Wall Street. “You want to stay away from this stuff now unless you’re doing it in very small size,” he said. There are just a few earnings in the week ahead. One of the handful of names reporting is meme name GameStop on Wednesday. Campbell Soup also reports that day, and Chewy reports Thursday. G-7 finance ministers meet this weekend, and President Joe Biden will attend a meeting of the organization’s leaders in Cornwall, England, on Friday.

May Payrolls Not Too Hot, Not Too Cold Before diving into today’s jobs report for May, it will be a useful exercise to recall the curveball that April’s report threw at investors. One of the more hotly contested topics investors have been debating recently is what to make of the jobs report released one month ago, where the consensus expectation was for 1,000,000 new jobs and we only got 266,000 (since revised up to 278,000). On the one hand, data releases are volatile by nature and it is possible that the large miss could have been broadly dismissed as a “one off” among a package of otherwise very healthy economic data. On the other hand, it did confirm anecdotal evidence of difficult hiring conditions facing companies and reinforced the notion that some workers may be reluctant to return to the workforce for a whole host of reasons. Moreover, if the April report really did unearth new evidence of a weaker-than-expected jobs market in this latter scenario, should we view the effect as temporary or does it have staying power that could spell new trouble for the overall economic recovery? Against this backdrop, investors were hoping that today’s May jobs report would go a long way towards providing some definitive answers to these important questions. It did not. But, that might actually be a good thing. Here are some key takeaways: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ May employment report revealed that the domestic economy added 559,000 jobs in May, slightly below Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ median forecast for a gain of 675,000. The prior two months also received net positive revisions of 27,000 jobs. The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 5.8%, though that was paired with a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate, which moved from 61.7% to 61.6%. Average hourly earnings rose 0.5% month over month, again signaling lower-wage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected. More new lower-wage jobs would be expected to put more downward pressure on wage increases. “It is hard to view 559,000 added jobs as a disappointment, but it does leave something to be desired,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market > Strategist Ryan Detrick. “There is strong potential for job prints in excess of one million over the coming months, but the truth is as strong as the economy is right now, the employment backdrop is clearly lagging what we were all expecting just a few months ago.” As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, May’s jobs number did jump above April’s disappointment, but still came well short of making a fresh new high for 2021. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Where do we go from here? The US economy is still 7.6 million total payrolls shy of its peak prior to the recession, and given the magnitude of that number, we still believe there is the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months. Several catalysts should also lend a helping hand in the near future. Enhanced unemployment benefits may be deterring lower-wage workers from returning to the labor market, as they reduce the relative attractiveness of a paycheck from an employer. In the last month, about half of all states have started eliminating these added benefits in order to reduce the disincentive. We believe this should show up in the data starting with the June employment report. Also, schools might be closing for the summer, but daycare centers are reopening more broadly, freeing parents up to find jobs. Warmer weather, ever-improving vaccination trends, and increasing comfort reengaging in normal activities should all play their parts as well. The labor market will always be inextricably linked to the inflation outlook, this cycle perhaps more than past cycles, and for many that is the real story today. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has made it clear it will tolerate near-term inflation overshoots in order to achieve “substantial further progress” towards its employment goals before it begins taking measures to combat higher inflation. Recent hotter-than-expected inflation reports have increasingly turned the spotlight towards the Fed’s timeline for reducing their asset purchases, which, given their stated position, will depend on strong payroll reports. As such, we find ourselves (to a degree) in a “good news is bad news” scenario, as strong labor market readings could hasten the Fed’s timetable to begin normalizing monetary policy. Today’s report likely did little to convince the Fed that the labor market is closer to meeting its “substantial further progress” goal on employment, and therefore, all else equal, will not compel them to consider reducing asset purchases sooner rather than later. There is much ground still to be made up in the labor market, and we believe the Fed will need to see a string of strong reports, likely in the one million range, before it begins to take action. From a Fed intervention standpoint, today’s employment report likely found a sweet spot, and the early indications are that equity markets are breathing a sigh of relief. For a deeper dive into the inflation picture, check the blog on Thursday, June 10, when data for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation is set to be released. Big First 5 Months Gains Consolidate Over Worst Months S&P 500 is up an impressive 11.9% for the first five months of 2021. That is the 16th best gain for the first five months since 1950. As illustrated in the graph above, gains do beget gains and this bodes well for the year as a whole. But this does not diminish the seasonal pattern of consolidation and mostly sideways market action over the Worst Six Months May-October and even more so over the Worst Four Months July-October. We tabulated the gains for the top 20 first five month gains since 1950 and the gains for the last seven months of the year are still pretty solid averaging 9.4% vs. 14.7% for the top 20 first five months. But the bulk of those gains as you can see in the graph come from late-October to yearend. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) June Swoon? Although there was some notable weakness in the middle of May, the S&P 500 Index was able to rally late in the month to finish with a modest gain. Incredibly, this was the eighth year out of the past nine that stocks gained during in May. Who said Sell in May? (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) As we noted a month ago, the worst six months of the year indeed are May through October, so we are still in the thick of a potentially challenging period based on seasonality. “After a nearly 90% rally off the lows, stocks could be ripe for a pullback, especially during the historically weak month of June,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But with the improving economy, coupled with historic fiscal and monetary stimulus, we expect any weakness to be short-lived.” (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Here are some stats to think about regarding S&P 500 performance in June: Since 1950, June is the 4th worst month of the year (September, February, and August are worse). It has been higher the past 5 years in a row, the longest since a stretch of 6 in a row in the late 1990s. The past 10 years, though, June was up 1.0% on average, ranking as the 7th best month. According to Sam Stovall of CFRA, only 5 market declines in excess of 5% started in June versus an average of 8 for all 12 months (since WWII). In other words, it isn’t common for major market weakness to start in June. Building on this, when the S&P 500 is lower in June, it is down by 2.9% on average. This is the second smallest average loss, with only December better at -2.5%. We wouldn’t be surprised at all if stocks took a well-deserved break in June, but this month is rather misunderstood, as a massive sell-off or the start of significant weakness isn’t likely, as that isn’t what June typically brings. Lastly, last Wednesday marked the 100th trading day of the year for the S&P 500. In fact, the S&P 500 was up more than 10% on the 100th day, which historically is a great start to the year, but also has meant continued strong performance the rest of the year is quite normal. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when stocks are up more than 10% on day 100, the rest of the year has been higher 84.2% of the time and up 8.6% on average, both well above what the average year does. We continue to recommend an overweight to equities and underweight to fixed-income position relative to investors’ targets, as appropriate. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Less Than 20% Bearish For the First Time in 115 Weeks Bullish sentiment measured through the AAII weekly survey was at the lowest level since the fall last week, but after jumping 7.7 percentage points, it is now at the highest level since the end of April. Not only is it high relative to the past few weeks, but the increase also brings bullish sentiment 6 percentage points back above its historical average. Additionally, the week over week increase was the largest since the week of April 8th when the reading had risen 11.1 percentage points. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) In recent weeks, neutral sentiment had been surging; topping 37% last week for the highest reading since the first week of 2020. Although it reversed lower this week down to 36.2%, neutral sentiment remains around some of the strongest levels in over a year. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) With the pickup in bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment plummeted to 19.8% on a 6.6 percentage point decile; the largest since February. Falling below 20%, bearish sentiment took out its March and April lows and is now at the lowest level since January 2018. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Not only is that one of the lowest readings in bearish sentiment in recent history, but that drop below 20% brought to an end a 115-week long streak of readings in bearish sentiment above that level. As shown below, that surpassed a three-week shorter streak ending in December 2017 to make for the second-longest such streak on record. The longest streak which ended in December 2010 went on for more than twice as long as this most recent run. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Historically, lower readings in bearish sentiment have tended towards weaker performance for the S&P 500 going forward as shown below. But when it comes to the past times that bearish sentiment has broken below 20% for the first time in at least 50 weeks, performance has actually tended to consistently be positive. In fact, across each of the past six instances, the S&P 500 has been higher six months out every time. Granted, for the most part the typical move higher is usually smaller than other periods. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Typical June Trading: Any Early Gains Tend to Fade Especially After Mid-Month Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-caps. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Main Street Sentiment Strongest in Over a Decade The U.S. economy is opening up and overall sentiment on Main Street is the strongest it’s been since our earliest analysis in 2005, according to LPL Research’s proprietary Beige Book Barometer (BBB). The result is based on our analysis of the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, a publication released two weeks before each Fed policy meeting that captures qualitative observations made by community bankers and business owners—what we like to think of as “Main Street” rather than “Wall Street.” The BBB gauges Main Street’s sentiment by looking at how frequently key words and phrases appear in the text. In the most recent Beige Book, “strong” words were near their highest since we first began tracking data in 2005 while weak words were their lowest on record, resulting in the strongest overall sentiment reading since inception. The strong reading is likely driven more by a change in direction than in overall activity, but even that is a welcome shift. “The country and the economy are going through a disruptive but positive change as most COVID-related restrictions are lifted and the economy reopens,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Sentiment is up and that’s a great sign for the direction of the economy.” (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) This was an important Beige Book in other ways. Mentions of COVID-related words (virus, COVID, pandemic) fell to their lowest level since the March 2020 Beige Book, when the words first started to appear. More concerning, words related to inflation also rose to their highest level since our earliest analysis. The downside of the economy’s rapid acceleration has been a mismatch between demand, which can ramp up quickly, and supply, which comes on line more slowly, while labor markets have also been slow to keep pace with reopening. Overall, the fundamental backdrop for the economy remains positive. Supply chain disruptions can slow the pace of the economic rebound but are likely temporary, while we expect reopening to be enduring. There is still some risk around variants, however, and full supply chain relief will likely need support from accelerated global vaccine distribution. US economic acceleration will probably peak in the second quarter, but there’s still plenty of scope for growth to moderate and still remain above average. Much of the positive news is already priced in for equity markets, which are forward looking, and gains may not come as easily, but we still see solid potential for upside as the economy continues to rebound. S&P 500 Returns Relative to History May has moved back to the rearview mirror and with that, we wanted to provide an update on how current long-term returns for the S&P 500 stack up relative to history. The chart below compares the trailing one, two, five, ten, and twenty-year annualized total returns of the S&P 500 to the S&P 500's historical average returns over those same time periods since 1928. We're starting to move away from the 'easy comps' in terms of market returns relative to the March 2020 lows, but the S&P 500 is still up more than 40% over the last 12 months which is nearly four times the historical average one year return. Over the last two years, the S&P 500's annualized return of 25.8% still comes in at more than twice the historical average of 10.6%. On a five and ten-year basis, the S&P 500's annualized gain also remains comfortably above 10%. All in all, the last decade has been very good for US equity investors. The only time period where the S&P 500 has experienced below-average returns is at the 20-year window where the 8.4% annualized gain clocks in at 2.5 percentage less than the historical average of 10.9%. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) The chart below compares the S&P 500's current returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to all other periods on a percentile basis. With mostly above-average returns, it comes as no surprise that most of the percentile readings rank above the 50th percentile, and for most time periods, the percentile rank comes in well above 50%. The one-year total return of more than 40% actually ranks just above the 93rd percentile, while the two-year return isn't far from the 90th percentile either. Moving further out, each of the other readings going out to ten years are all well above the 50th percentile. The only percentile rank below the 50th percentile is the 20-year window and that reading isn't even close. On the one hand, the last ten years have been phenomenal for equity investors, but the last 20 years haven't even been mediocre. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Throughout history, many investors have always worked under the assumption that long-term returns for the equity market are about 10%. History has shown that to be the case over the last decade at least, as the average annualized one-year gain of the S&P 500 has been well above 10%. With the S&P 500's current 20-year annualized gain currently at just 8.4%, though, what will it take for the S&P 500 to reach double-digit gains on an annualized basis over a 20-year window? For an idea, given the strong performance of the last ten years, a number of commentators suggest that the next ten years for equities will be weak with a reversion to the mean. Only time will tell, but if we operate under the (unlikely) assumption that the S&P 500 stays at the exact same level it is now going forward for the next ten years, its annualized twenty-year return would top 10% for the first time since August 2008 next September. After that brief period above 10% from September 2022 through March 2023, it wouldn't again top that level until February 2029. In spite of the fact that the annualized 20-year return would top 10% in those two periods, though, it still wouldn't get as high as the historical average of 10.9% in either of those periods. This reflects the fact that although the last ten years for US equities have been very strong, they also came shortly after one of the worst ten-year periods for US equities on record.

,"Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 7th, 2021. AMC, meme stocks could spark more heat in the week ahead as investors await inflation news - (Source) Inflation data is a highlight of the week ahead, as investors focus on economic news in the void between earnings season and the next Fed meeting. May’s consumer price index is scheduled to be reported Thursday, and it could be hot after it surged in April. Inflation is viewed as an important trigger that could cause the Federal Reserve to step back from its easy policies, if rising prices appear to be hotter and more persistent than expected. Equities were higher in the past week, but the meme stocks were far hotter. AMC Entertainment gained another 100% and was up 2,700% since January. Energy was the best-performing major sector, gaining more than 6.7% as oil prices jumped nearly 5% in the past week. REITs were the second-best performer, up 3.1%, followed by financials, up 1.2% and technology, also up 1.2%. But it’s the meme stocks that took the headlines, and also contributed to concerns about froth in the stock market. “People think this is new. It completely isn’t,” Dan Niles, founder of Satori Fund, said of the trading frenzy. He noted there was similar froth in individual stocks in 1999, when companies added dot-com to their names to attract investor attention. “What’s new is the fact that these traders are armed with stimulus checks. They can organize more easily on things like WallStreetBets, they can work from home, and there’s no-cost trading. Those are the differences,” Niles said on CNBC. “So, if it gets people interested in investing, that’s great. What I don’t like is when you have people sort of taking out mortgages on their home, and putting themselves at risk if the thing collapsed,” he added. “You want to be able to invest what you can afford to lose if you’re going to play in something like this.” Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities, said the trading in names like GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond is one of the things that has made him more cautious about the market. He said the high valuations on the meme names are unlikely to last. “It’s going to be around as long as cicadas are,” he said. The S&P 500 in the past week gained 0.6%, rising to 4,229, just 9 points from its all-time high. The Dow was up 0.7% to 34,756, and the Nasdaq gained 0.5% to 13,814. Watching the inflation signs Massocca said investors should stay focused on things like inflation, since that could be what makes the Federal Reserve reverse its easy policy. The Fed has so far said it sees the higher inflation readings as transitory. Economists expect CPI to be up 4.7% year over year, after April’s 4.2% pace, according to Dow Jones. Core inflation is expected to be up 0.4% for the month and 3.4% year over year. “I’m getting nervous. I’m seeing signs of a top. I’m systematically raising cash. I think the market looks too expensive,” Massocca said. “We’re going to shake off the dust from Covid. The economy is going to be very, very good and as a rule, I think monetary policy is going to respond to some degree.” He said the memes mania is just one sign, but the spark for a sell-off could be anything including a hawkish comment from the Fed. “Who knows what it is, but the kindling is building and as soon as a match hits it, the market is setting up for a 7% to 10% pullback at some point,” he said. “Who knows what starts it. ... One of the candidates very likely will be some kind of reductions in monetary policy.” Fear of the Fed stepping back from its easy policy has been hanging over the market. Friday’s May employment report was being watched closely, but the lower-than-expected job gains reinforced that the Fed could continue to hold off on policy changes for the time being. There were 559,000 jobs added in May, well below the 671,000 expected. Now the CPI report is the next point of focus, ahead of the Fed’s June 15-16 meeting. The question is, will it be so hot that the central bank may have to reassess its view about the temporary nature of inflation, or could it show that price increases are peaking? “There’s inflation out there. You can see it everywhere,” said Massocca. Taper talk The market has been expecting the Fed to begin to talk about unwinding its bond buying later this year, with many strategists targeting the Fed’s Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium at the end of August. The Fed is expected to first discuss cutting back its purchases months ahead of taking action. Then it will slowly reduce its buying. After that, it could consider interest rate hikes, now not expected by the market until 2023. Niles said the meme stock trend has been fueled in part by the Fed. The markets are awash in liquidity as the central bank keeps rates at zero and maintains its monthly purchases of at least $120 billion in Treasury and mortgage securities. “When the Fed backs off of that with tapering, I think that’s when you can go in and say, ‘OK’ we can potentially go after and short some of these highly valued names because that’s when the free money disappears and you actually start to contract some of that free money,” he said. “That’s when things start to get dangerous to the downside.” For now, Niles said he’s staying away from the names that are heavily sought by retail investors or have large short interest and are targeted by Wall Street. “You want to stay away from this stuff now unless you’re doing it in very small size,” he said. There are just a few earnings in the week ahead. One of the handful of names reporting is meme name GameStop on Wednesday. Campbell Soup also reports that day, and Chewy reports Thursday. G-7 finance ministers meet this weekend, and President Joe Biden will attend a meeting of the organization’s leaders in Cornwall, England, on Friday.

Recent hotter-than-expected inflation reports have increasingly turned the spotlight towards the Fed’s timeline for reducing their asset purchases, which, given their stated position, will depend on strong payroll reports. As such, we find ourselves (to a degree) in a “good news is bad news” scenario, as strong labor market readings could hasten the Fed’s timetable to begin normalizing monetary policy. Today’s report likely did little to convince the Fed that the labor market is closer to meeting its “substantial further progress” goal on employment, and therefore, all else equal, will not compel them to consider reducing asset purchases sooner rather than later. There is much ground still to be made up in the labor market, and we believe the Fed will need to see a string of strong reports, likely in the one million range, before it begins to take action. From a Fed intervention standpoint, today’s employment report likely found a sweet spot, and the early indications are that equity markets are breathing a sigh of relief. For a deeper dive into the inflation picture, check the blog on Thursday, June 10, when data for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation is set to be released. Big First 5 Months Gains Consolidate Over Worst Months S&P 500 is up an impressive 11.9% for the first five months of 2021. That is the 16th best gain for the first five months since 1950. As illustrated in the graph above, gains do beget gains and this bodes well for the year as a whole. But this does not diminish the seasonal pattern of consolidation and mostly sideways market action over the Worst Six Months May-October and even more so over the Worst Four Months July-October. We tabulated the gains for the top 20 first five month gains since 1950 and the gains for the last seven months of the year are still pretty solid averaging 9.4% vs. 14.7% for the top 20 first five months. But the bulk of those gains as you can see in the graph come from late-October to yearend. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) June Swoon? Although there was some notable weakness in the middle of May, the S&P 500 Index was able to rally late in the month to finish with a modest gain. Incredibly, this was the eighth year out of the past nine that stocks gained during in May. Who said Sell in May? (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) As we noted a month ago, the worst six months of the year indeed are May through October, so we are still in the thick of a potentially challenging period based on seasonality. “After a nearly 90% rally off the lows, stocks could be ripe for a pullback, especially during the historically weak month of June,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But with the improving economy, coupled with historic fiscal and monetary stimulus, we expect any weakness to be short-lived.” (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Here are some stats to think about regarding S&P 500 performance in June: Since 1950, June is the 4th worst month of the year (September, February, and August are worse). It has been higher the past 5 years in a row, the longest since a stretch of 6 in a row in the late 1990s. The past 10 years, though, June was up 1.0% on average, ranking as the 7th best month. According to Sam Stovall of CFRA, only 5 market declines in excess of 5% started in June versus an average of 8 for all 12 months (since WWII). In other words, it isn’t common for major market weakness to start in June. Building on this, when the S&P 500 is lower in June, it is down by 2.9% on average. This is the second smallest average loss, with only December better at -2.5%. We wouldn’t be surprised at all if stocks took a well-deserved break in June, but this month is rather misunderstood, as a massive sell-off or the start of significant weakness isn’t likely, as that isn’t what June typically brings. Lastly, last Wednesday marked the 100th trading day of the year for the S&P 500. In fact, the S&P 500 was up more than 10% on the 100th day, which historically is a great start to the year, but also has meant continued strong performance the rest of the year is quite normal. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when stocks are up more than 10% on day 100, the rest of the year has been higher 84.2% of the time and up 8.6% on average, both well above what the average year does. We continue to recommend an overweight to equities and underweight to fixed-income position relative to investors’ targets, as appropriate. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Less Than 20% Bearish For the First Time in 115 Weeks Bullish sentiment measured through the AAII weekly survey was at the lowest level since the fall last week, but after jumping 7.7 percentage points, it is now at the highest level since the end of April. Not only is it high relative to the past few weeks, but the increase also brings bullish sentiment 6 percentage points back above its historical average. Additionally, the week over week increase was the largest since the week of April 8th when the reading had risen 11.1 percentage points. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) In recent weeks, neutral sentiment had been surging; topping 37% last week for the highest reading since the first week of 2020. Although it reversed lower this week down to 36.2%, neutral sentiment remains around some of the strongest levels in over a year. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) With the pickup in bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment plummeted to 19.8% on a 6.6 percentage point decile; the largest since February. Falling below 20%, bearish sentiment took out its March and April lows and is now at the lowest level since January 2018. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Not only is that one of the lowest readings in bearish sentiment in recent history, but that drop below 20% brought to an end a 115-week long streak of readings in bearish sentiment above that level. As shown below, that surpassed a three-week shorter streak ending in December 2017 to make for the second-longest such streak on record. The longest streak which ended in December 2010 went on for more than twice as long as this most recent run. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Historically, lower readings in bearish sentiment have tended towards weaker performance for the S&P 500 going forward as shown below. But when it comes to the past times that bearish sentiment has broken below 20% for the first time in at least 50 weeks, performance has actually tended to consistently be positive. In fact, across each of the past six instances, the S&P 500 has been higher six months out every time. Granted, for the most part the typical move higher is usually smaller than other periods. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Typical June Trading: Any Early Gains Tend to Fade Especially After Mid-Month Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-caps. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Main Street Sentiment Strongest in Over a Decade The U.S. economy is opening up and overall sentiment on Main Street is the strongest it’s been since our earliest analysis in 2005, according to LPL Research’s proprietary Beige Book Barometer (BBB). The result is based on our analysis of the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, a publication released two weeks before each Fed policy meeting that captures qualitative observations made by community bankers and business owners—what we like to think of as “Main Street” rather than “Wall Street.” The BBB gauges Main Street’s sentiment by looking at how frequently key words and phrases appear in the text. In the most recent Beige Book, “strong” words were near their highest since we first began tracking data in 2005 while weak words were their lowest on record, resulting in the strongest overall sentiment reading since inception. The strong reading is likely driven more by a change in direction than in overall activity, but even that is a welcome shift. “The country and the economy are going through a disruptive but positive change as most COVID-related restrictions are lifted and the economy reopens,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Sentiment is up and that’s a great sign for the direction of the economy.” (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) This was an important Beige Book in other ways. Mentions of COVID-related words (virus, COVID, pandemic) fell to their lowest level since the March 2020 Beige Book, when the words first started to appear. More concerning, words related to inflation also rose to their highest level since our earliest analysis. The downside of the economy’s rapid acceleration has been a mismatch between demand, which can ramp up quickly, and supply, which comes on line more slowly, while labor markets have also been slow to keep pace with reopening. Overall, the fundamental backdrop for the economy remains positive. Supply chain disruptions can slow the pace of the economic rebound but are likely temporary, while we expect reopening to be enduring. There is still some risk around variants, however, and full supply chain relief will likely need support from accelerated global vaccine distribution. US economic acceleration will probably peak in the second quarter, but there’s still plenty of scope for growth to moderate and still remain above average. Much of the positive news is already priced in for equity markets, which are forward looking, and gains may not come as easily, but we still see solid potential for upside as the economy continues to rebound. S&P 500 Returns Relative to History May has moved back to the rearview mirror and with that, we wanted to provide an update on how current long-term returns for the S&P 500 stack up relative to history. The chart below compares the trailing one, two, five, ten, and twenty-year annualized total returns of the S&P 500 to the S&P 500's historical average returns over those same time periods since 1928. We're starting to move away from the 'easy comps' in terms of market returns relative to the March 2020 lows, but the S&P 500 is still up more than 40% over the last 12 months which is nearly four times the historical average one year return. Over the last two years, the S&P 500's annualized return of 25.8% still comes in at more than twice the historical average of 10.6%. On a five and ten-year basis, the S&P 500's annualized gain also remains comfortably above 10%. All in all, the last decade has been very good for US equity investors. The only time period where the S&P 500 has experienced below-average returns is at the 20-year window where the 8.4% annualized gain clocks in at 2.5 percentage less than the historical average of 10.9%. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) The chart below compares the S&P 500's current returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to all other periods on a percentile basis. With mostly above-average returns, it comes as no surprise that most of the percentile readings rank above the 50th percentile, and for most time periods, the percentile rank comes in well above 50%. The one-year total return of more than 40% actually ranks just above the 93rd percentile, while the two-year return isn't far from the 90th percentile either. Moving further out, each of the other readings going out to ten years are all well above the 50th percentile. The only percentile rank below the 50th percentile is the 20-year window and that reading isn't even close. On the one hand, the last ten years have been phenomenal for equity investors, but the last 20 years haven't even been mediocre. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Throughout history, many investors have always worked under the assumption that long-term returns for the equity market are about 10%. History has shown that to be the case over the last decade at least, as the average annualized one-year gain of the S&P 500 has been well above 10%. With the S&P 500's current 20-year annualized gain currently at just 8.4%, though, what will it take for the S&P 500 to reach double-digit gains on an annualized basis over a 20-year window? For an idea, given the strong performance of the last ten years, a number of commentators suggest that the next ten years for equities will be weak with a reversion to the mean. Only time will tell, but if we operate under the (unlikely) assumption that the S&P 500 stays at the exact same level it is now going forward for the next ten years, its annualized twenty-year return would top 10% for the first time since August 2008 next September. After that brief period above 10% from September 2022 through March 2023, it wouldn't again top that level until February 2029. In spite of the fact that the annualized 20-year return would top 10% in those two periods, though, it still wouldn't get as high as the historical average of 10.9% in either of those periods. This reflects the fact that although the last ten years for US equities have been very strong, they also came shortly after one of the worst ten-year periods for US equities on record.

,"Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 7th, 2021. AMC, meme stocks could spark more heat in the week ahead as investors await inflation news - (Source) Inflation data is a highlight of the week ahead, as investors focus on economic news in the void between earnings season and the next Fed meeting. May’s consumer price index is scheduled to be reported Thursday, and it could be hot after it surged in April. Inflation is viewed as an important trigger that could cause the Federal Reserve to step back from its easy policies, if rising prices appear to be hotter and more persistent than expected. Equities were higher in the past week, but the meme stocks were far hotter. AMC Entertainment gained another 100% and was up 2,700% since January. Energy was the best-performing major sector, gaining more than 6.7% as oil prices jumped nearly 5% in the past week. REITs were the second-best performer, up 3.1%, followed by financials, up 1.2% and technology, also up 1.2%. But it’s the meme stocks that took the headlines, and also contributed to concerns about froth in the stock market. “People think this is new. It completely isn’t,” Dan Niles, founder of Satori Fund, said of the trading frenzy. He noted there was similar froth in individual stocks in 1999, when companies added dot-com to their names to attract investor attention. “What’s new is the fact that these traders are armed with stimulus checks. They can organize more easily on things like WallStreetBets, they can work from home, and there’s no-cost trading. Those are the differences,” Niles said on CNBC. “So, if it gets people interested in investing, that’s great. What I don’t like is when you have people sort of taking out mortgages on their home, and putting themselves at risk if the thing collapsed,” he added. “You want to be able to invest what you can afford to lose if you’re going to play in something like this.” Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities, said the trading in names like GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond is one of the things that has made him more cautious about the market. He said the high valuations on the meme names are unlikely to last. “It’s going to be around as long as cicadas are,” he said. The S&P 500 in the past week gained 0.6%, rising to 4,229, just 9 points from its all-time high. The Dow was up 0.7% to 34,756, and the Nasdaq gained 0.5% to 13,814. Watching the inflation signs Massocca said investors should stay focused on things like inflation, since that could be what makes the Federal Reserve reverse its easy policy. The Fed has so far said it sees the higher inflation readings as transitory. Economists expect CPI to be up 4.7% year over year, after April’s 4.2% pace, according to Dow Jones. Core inflation is expected to be up 0.4% for the month and 3.4% year over year. “I’m getting nervous. I’m seeing signs of a top. I’m systematically raising cash. I think the market looks too expensive,” Massocca said. “We’re going to shake off the dust from Covid. The economy is going to be very, very good and as a rule, I think monetary policy is going to respond to some degree.” He said the memes mania is just one sign, but the spark for a sell-off could be anything including a hawkish comment from the Fed. “Who knows what it is, but the kindling is building and as soon as a match hits it, the market is setting up for a 7% to 10% pullback at some point,” he said. “Who knows what starts it. ... One of the candidates very likely will be some kind of reductions in monetary policy.” Fear of the Fed stepping back from its easy policy has been hanging over the market. Friday’s May employment report was being watched closely, but the lower-than-expected job gains reinforced that the Fed could continue to hold off on policy changes for the time being. There were 559,000 jobs added in May, well below the 671,000 expected. Now the CPI report is the next point of focus, ahead of the Fed’s June 15-16 meeting. The question is, will it be so hot that the central bank may have to reassess its view about the temporary nature of inflation, or could it show that price increases are peaking? “There’s inflation out there. You can see it everywhere,” said Massocca. Taper talk The market has been expecting the Fed to begin to talk about unwinding its bond buying later this year, with many strategists targeting the Fed’s Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium at the end of August. The Fed is expected to first discuss cutting back its purchases months ahead of taking action. Then it will slowly reduce its buying. After that, it could consider interest rate hikes, now not expected by the market until 2023. Niles said the meme stock trend has been fueled in part by the Fed. The markets are awash in liquidity as the central bank keeps rates at zero and maintains its monthly purchases of at least $120 billion in Treasury and mortgage securities. “When the Fed backs off of that with tapering, I think that’s when you can go in and say, ‘OK’ we can potentially go after and short some of these highly valued names because that’s when the free money disappears and you actually start to contract some of that free money,” he said. “That’s when things start to get dangerous to the downside.” For now, Niles said he’s staying away from the names that are heavily sought by retail investors or have large short interest and are targeted by Wall Street. “You want to stay away from this stuff now unless you’re doing it in very small size,” he said. There are just a few earnings in the week ahead. One of the handful of names reporting is meme name GameStop on Wednesday. Campbell Soup also reports that day, and Chewy reports Thursday. G-7 finance ministers meet this weekend, and President Joe Biden will attend a meeting of the organization’s leaders in Cornwall, England, on Friday.

May Payrolls Not Too Hot, Not Too Cold Before diving into today’s jobs report for May, it will be a useful exercise to recall the curveball that April’s report threw at investors. One of the more hotly contested topics investors have been debating recently is what to make of the jobs report released one month ago, where the consensus expectation was for 1,000,000 new jobs and we only got 266,000 (since revised up to 278,000). On the one hand, data releases are volatile by nature and it is possible that the large miss could have been broadly dismissed as a “one off” among a package of otherwise very healthy economic data. On the other hand, it did confirm anecdotal evidence of difficult hiring conditions facing companies and reinforced the notion that some workers may be reluctant to return to the workforce for a whole host of reasons. Moreover, if the April report really did unearth new evidence of a weaker-than-expected jobs market in this latter scenario, should we view the effect as temporary or does it have staying power that could spell new trouble for the overall economic recovery? Against this backdrop, investors were hoping that today’s May jobs report would go a long way towards providing some definitive answers to these important questions. It did not. But, that might actually be a good thing. Here are some key takeaways: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ May employment report revealed that the domestic economy added 559,000 jobs in May, slightly below Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ median forecast for a gain of 675,000. The prior two months also received net positive revisions of 27,000 jobs. The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 5.8%, though that was paired with a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate, which moved from 61.7% to 61.6%. Average hourly earnings rose 0.5% month over month, again signaling lower-wage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected. More new lower-wage jobs would be expected to put more downward pressure on wage increases. “It is hard to view 559,000 added jobs as a disappointment, but it does leave something to be desired,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market > Strategist Ryan Detrick. “There is strong potential for job prints in excess of one million over the coming months, but the truth is as strong as the economy is right now, the employment backdrop is clearly lagging what we were all expecting just a few months ago.” As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, May’s jobs number did jump above April’s disappointment, but still came well short of making a fresh new high for 2021. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Where do we go from here? The US economy is still 7.6 million total payrolls shy of its peak prior to the recession, and given the magnitude of that number, we still believe there is the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months. Several catalysts should also lend a helping hand in the near future. Enhanced unemployment benefits may be deterring lower-wage workers from returning to the labor market, as they reduce the relative attractiveness of a paycheck from an employer. In the last month, about half of all states have started eliminating these added benefits in order to reduce the disincentive. We believe this should show up in the data starting with the June employment report. Also, schools might be closing for the summer, but daycare centers are reopening more broadly, freeing parents up to find jobs. Warmer weather, ever-improving vaccination trends, and increasing comfort reengaging in normal activities should all play their parts as well. The labor market will always be inextricably linked to the inflation outlook, this cycle perhaps more than past cycles, and for many that is the real story today. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has made it clear it will tolerate near-term inflation overshoots in order to achieve “substantial further progress” towards its employment goals before it begins taking measures to combat higher inflation. Recent hotter-than-expected inflation reports have increasingly turned the spotlight towards the Fed’s timeline for reducing their asset purchases, which, given their stated position, will depend on strong payroll reports. As such, we find ourselves (to a degree) in a “good news is bad news” scenario, as strong labor market readings could hasten the Fed’s timetable to begin normalizing monetary policy. Today’s report likely did little to convince the Fed that the labor market is closer to meeting its “substantial further progress” goal on employment, and therefore, all else equal, will not compel them to consider reducing asset purchases sooner rather than later. There is much ground still to be made up in the labor market, and we believe the Fed will need to see a string of strong reports, likely in the one million range, before it begins to take action. From a Fed intervention standpoint, today’s employment report likely found a sweet spot, and the early indications are that equity markets are breathing a sigh of relief.

As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when stocks are up more than 10% on day 100, the rest of the year has been higher 84.2% of the time and up 8.6% on average, both well above what the average year does. We continue to recommend an overweight to equities and underweight to fixed-income position relative to investors’ targets, as appropriate. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!)

But when it comes to the past times that bearish sentiment has broken below 20% for the first time in at least 50 weeks, performance has actually tended to consistently be positive. In fact, across each of the past six instances, the S&P 500 has been higher six months out every time. Granted, for the most part the typical move higher is usually smaller than other periods.

Typical June Trading: Any Early Gains Tend to Fade Especially After Mid-Month Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-caps. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Main Street Sentiment Strongest in Over a Decade The U.S. economy is opening up and overall sentiment on Main Street is the strongest it’s been since our earliest analysis in 2005, according to LPL Research’s proprietary Beige Book Barometer (BBB). The result is based on our analysis of the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, a publication released two weeks before each Fed policy meeting that captures qualitative observations made by community bankers and business owners—what we like to think of as “Main Street” rather than “Wall Street.” The BBB gauges Main Street’s sentiment by looking at how frequently key words and phrases appear in the text. In the most recent Beige Book, “strong” words were near their highest since we first began tracking data in 2005 while weak words were their lowest on record, resulting in the strongest overall sentiment reading since inception. The strong reading is likely driven more by a change in direction than in overall activity, but even that is a welcome shift. “The country and the economy are going through a disruptive but positive change as most COVID-related restrictions are lifted and the economy reopens,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Sentiment is up and that’s a great sign for the direction of the economy.” (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) This was an important Beige Book in other ways. Mentions of COVID-related words (virus, COVID, pandemic) fell to their lowest level since the March 2020 Beige Book, when the words first started to appear. More concerning, words related to inflation also rose to their highest level since our earliest analysis. The downside of the economy’s rapid acceleration has been a mismatch between demand, which can ramp up quickly, and supply, which comes on line more slowly, while labor markets have also been slow to keep pace with reopening. Overall, the fundamental backdrop for the economy remains positive. Supply chain disruptions can slow the pace of the economic rebound but are likely temporary, while we expect reopening to be enduring. There is still some risk around variants, however, and full supply chain relief will likely need support from accelerated global vaccine distribution. US economic acceleration will probably peak in the second quarter, but there’s still plenty of scope for growth to moderate and still remain above average. Much of the positive news is already priced in for equity markets, which are forward looking, and gains may not come as easily, but we still see solid potential for upside as the economy continues to rebound. S&P 500 Returns Relative to History May has moved back to the rearview mirror and with that, we wanted to provide an update on how current long-term returns for the S&P 500 stack up relative to history. The chart below compares the trailing one, two, five, ten, and twenty-year annualized total returns of the S&P 500 to the S&P 500's historical average returns over those same time periods since 1928. We're starting to move away from the 'easy comps' in terms of market returns relative to the March 2020 lows, but the S&P 500 is still up more than 40% over the last 12 months which is nearly four times the historical average one year return. Over the last two years, the S&P 500's annualized return of 25.8% still comes in at more than twice the historical average of 10.6%. On a five and ten-year basis, the S&P 500's annualized gain also remains comfortably above 10%. All in all, the last decade has been very good for US equity investors. The only time period where the S&P 500 has experienced below-average returns is at the 20-year window where the 8.4% annualized gain clocks in at 2.5 percentage less than the historical average of 10.9%. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) The chart below compares the S&P 500's current returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to all other periods on a percentile basis. With mostly above-average returns, it comes as no surprise that most of the percentile readings rank above the 50th percentile, and for most time periods, the percentile rank comes in well above 50%. The one-year total return of more than 40% actually ranks just above the 93rd percentile, while the two-year return isn't far from the 90th percentile either. Moving further out, each of the other readings going out to ten years are all well above the 50th percentile. The only percentile rank below the 50th percentile is the 20-year window and that reading isn't even close. On the one hand, the last ten years have been phenomenal for equity investors, but the last 20 years haven't even been mediocre. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Throughout history, many investors have always worked under the assumption that long-term returns for the equity market are about 10%. History has shown that to be the case over the last decade at least, as the average annualized one-year gain of the S&P 500 has been well above 10%. With the S&P 500's current 20-year annualized gain currently at just 8.4%, though, what will it take for the S&P 500 to reach double-digit gains on an annualized basis over a 20-year window? For an idea, given the strong performance of the last ten years, a number of commentators suggest that the next ten years for equities will be weak with a reversion to the mean. Only time will tell, but if we operate under the (unlikely) assumption that the S&P 500 stays at the exact same level it is now going forward for the next ten years, its annualized twenty-year return would top 10% for the first time since August 2008 next September. After that brief period above 10% from September 2022 through March 2023, it wouldn't again top that level until February 2029. In spite of the fact that the annualized 20-year return would top 10% in those two periods, though, it still wouldn't get as high as the historical average of 10.9% in either of those periods. This reflects the fact that although the last ten years for US equities have been very strong, they also came shortly after one of the worst ten-year periods for US equities on record.

,"Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 7th, 2021. AMC, meme stocks could spark more heat in the week ahead as investors await inflation news - (Source) Inflation data is a highlight of the week ahead, as investors focus on economic news in the void between earnings season and the next Fed meeting. May’s consumer price index is scheduled to be reported Thursday, and it could be hot after it surged in April. Inflation is viewed as an important trigger that could cause the Federal Reserve to step back from its easy policies, if rising prices appear to be hotter and more persistent than expected. Equities were higher in the past week, but the meme stocks were far hotter. AMC Entertainment gained another 100% and was up 2,700% since January. Energy was the best-performing major sector, gaining more than 6.7% as oil prices jumped nearly 5% in the past week. REITs were the second-best performer, up 3.1%, followed by financials, up 1.2% and technology, also up 1.2%. But it’s the meme stocks that took the headlines, and also contributed to concerns about froth in the stock market. “People think this is new. It completely isn’t,” Dan Niles, founder of Satori Fund, said of the trading frenzy. He noted there was similar froth in individual stocks in 1999, when companies added dot-com to their names to attract investor attention. “What’s new is the fact that these traders are armed with stimulus checks. They can organize more easily on things like WallStreetBets, they can work from home, and there’s no-cost trading. Those are the differences,” Niles said on CNBC. “So, if it gets people interested in investing, that’s great. What I don’t like is when you have people sort of taking out mortgages on their home, and putting themselves at risk if the thing collapsed,” he added. “You want to be able to invest what you can afford to lose if you’re going to play in something like this.” Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities, said the trading in names like GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond is one of the things that has made him more cautious about the market. He said the high valuations on the meme names are unlikely to last. “It’s going to be around as long as cicadas are,” he said. The S&P 500 in the past week gained 0.6%, rising to 4,229, just 9 points from its all-time high. The Dow was up 0.7% to 34,756, and the Nasdaq gained 0.5% to 13,814. Watching the inflation signs Massocca said investors should stay focused on things like inflation, since that could be what makes the Federal Reserve reverse its easy policy. The Fed has so far said it sees the higher inflation readings as transitory. Economists expect CPI to be up 4.7% year over year, after April’s 4.2% pace, according to Dow Jones. Core inflation is expected to be up 0.4% for the month and 3.4% year over year. “I’m getting nervous. I’m seeing signs of a top. I’m systematically raising cash. I think the market looks too expensive,” Massocca said. “We’re going to shake off the dust from Covid. The economy is going to be very, very good and as a rule, I think monetary policy is going to respond to some degree.” He said the memes mania is just one sign, but the spark for a sell-off could be anything including a hawkish comment from the Fed. “Who knows what it is, but the kindling is building and as soon as a match hits it, the market is setting up for a 7% to 10% pullback at some point,” he said. “Who knows what starts it. ... One of the candidates very likely will be some kind of reductions in monetary policy.” Fear of the Fed stepping back from its easy policy has been hanging over the market. Friday’s May employment report was being watched closely, but the lower-than-expected job gains reinforced that the Fed could continue to hold off on policy changes for the time being. There were 559,000 jobs added in May, well below the 671,000 expected. Now the CPI report is the next point of focus, ahead of the Fed’s June 15-16 meeting. The question is, will it be so hot that the central bank may have to reassess its view about the temporary nature of inflation, or could it show that price increases are peaking? “There’s inflation out there. You can see it everywhere,” said Massocca. Taper talk The market has been expecting the Fed to begin to talk about unwinding its bond buying later this year, with many strategists targeting the Fed’s Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium at the end of August. The Fed is expected to first discuss cutting back its purchases months ahead of taking action. Then it will slowly reduce its buying. After that, it could consider interest rate hikes, now not expected by the market until 2023. Niles said the meme stock trend has been fueled in part by the Fed. The markets are awash in liquidity as the central bank keeps rates at zero and maintains its monthly purchases of at least $120 billion in Treasury and mortgage securities. “When the Fed backs off of that with tapering, I think that’s when you can go in and say, ‘OK’ we can potentially go after and short some of these highly valued names because that’s when the free money disappears and you actually start to contract some of that free money,” he said. “That’s when things start to get dangerous to the downside.” For now, Niles said he’s staying away from the names that are heavily sought by retail investors or have large short interest and are targeted by Wall Street. “You want to stay away from this stuff now unless you’re doing it in very small size,” he said. There are just a few earnings in the week ahead. One of the handful of names reporting is meme name GameStop on Wednesday. Campbell Soup also reports that day, and Chewy reports Thursday. G-7 finance ministers meet this weekend, and President Joe Biden will attend a meeting of the organization’s leaders in Cornwall, England, on Friday.

May Payrolls Not Too Hot, Not Too Cold Before diving into today’s jobs report for May, it will be a useful exercise to recall the curveball that April’s report threw at investors. One of the more hotly contested topics investors have been debating recently is what to make of the jobs report released one month ago, where the consensus expectation was for 1,000,000 new jobs and we only got 266,000 (since revised up to 278,000). On the one hand, data releases are volatile by nature and it is possible that the large miss could have been broadly dismissed as a “one off” among a package of otherwise very healthy economic data. On the other hand, it did confirm anecdotal evidence of difficult hiring conditions facing companies and reinforced the notion that some workers may be reluctant to return to the workforce for a whole host of reasons. Moreover, if the April report really did unearth new evidence of a weaker-than-expected jobs market in this latter scenario, should we view the effect as temporary or does it have staying power that could spell new trouble for the overall economic recovery? Against this backdrop, investors were hoping that today’s May jobs report would go a long way towards providing some definitive answers to these important questions. It did not. But, that might actually be a good thing. Here are some key takeaways: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ May employment report revealed that the domestic economy added 559,000 jobs in May, slightly below Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ median forecast for a gain of 675,000. The prior two months also received net positive revisions of 27,000 jobs. The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 5.8%, though that was paired with a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate, which moved from 61.7% to 61.6%. Average hourly earnings rose 0.5% month over month, again signaling lower-wage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected. More new lower-wage jobs would be expected to put more downward pressure on wage increases. “It is hard to view 559,000 added jobs as a disappointment, but it does leave something to be desired,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market > Strategist Ryan Detrick. “There is strong potential for job prints in excess of one million over the coming months, but the truth is as strong as the economy is right now, the employment backdrop is clearly lagging what we were all expecting just a few months ago.” As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, May’s jobs number did jump above April’s disappointment, but still came well short of making a fresh new high for 2021. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Where do we go from here? The US economy is still 7.6 million total payrolls shy of its peak prior to the recession, and given the magnitude of that number, we still believe there is the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months. Several catalysts should also lend a helping hand in the near future. Enhanced unemployment benefits may be deterring lower-wage workers from returning to the labor market, as they reduce the relative attractiveness of a paycheck from an employer. In the last month, about half of all states have started eliminating these added benefits in order to reduce the disincentive. We believe this should show up in the data starting with the June employment report. Also, schools might be closing for the summer, but daycare centers are reopening more broadly, freeing parents up to find jobs. Warmer weather, ever-improving vaccination trends, and increasing comfort reengaging in normal activities should all play their parts as well. The labor market will always be inextricably linked to the inflation outlook, this cycle perhaps more than past cycles, and for many that is the real story today. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has made it clear it will tolerate near-term inflation overshoots in order to achieve “substantial further progress” towards its employment goals before it begins taking measures to combat higher inflation. Recent hotter-than-expected inflation reports have increasingly turned the spotlight towards the Fed’s timeline for reducing their asset purchases, which, given their stated position, will depend on strong payroll reports. As such, we find ourselves (to a degree) in a “good news is bad news” scenario, as strong labor market readings could hasten the Fed’s timetable to begin normalizing monetary policy. Today’s report likely did little to convince the Fed that the labor market is closer to meeting its “substantial further progress” goal on employment, and therefore, all else equal, will not compel them to consider reducing asset purchases sooner rather than later. There is much ground still to be made up in the labor market, and we believe the Fed will need to see a string of strong reports, likely in the one million range, before it begins to take action. From a Fed intervention standpoint, today’s employment report likely found a sweet spot, and the early indications are that equity markets are breathing a sigh of relief. For a deeper dive into the inflation picture, check the blog on Thursday, June 10, when data for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation is set to be released. Big First 5 Months Gains Consolidate Over Worst Months S&P 500 is up an impressive 11.9% for the first five months of 2021. That is the 16th best gain for the first five months since 1950. As illustrated in the graph above, gains do beget gains and this bodes well for the year as a whole. But this does not diminish the seasonal pattern of consolidation and mostly sideways market action over the Worst Six Months May-October and even more so over the Worst Four Months July-October. We tabulated the gains for the top 20 first five month gains since 1950 and the gains for the last seven months of the year are still pretty solid averaging 9.4% vs. 14.7% for the top 20 first five months. But the bulk of those gains as you can see in the graph come from late-October to yearend. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) June Swoon? Although there was some notable weakness in the middle of May, the S&P 500 Index was able to rally late in the month to finish with a modest gain. Incredibly, this was the eighth year out of the past nine that stocks gained during in May. Who said Sell in May? (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) As we noted a month ago, the worst six months of the year indeed are May through October, so we are still in the thick of a potentially challenging period based on seasonality. “After a nearly 90% rally off the lows, stocks could be ripe for a pullback, especially during the historically weak month of June,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But with the improving economy, coupled with historic fiscal and monetary stimulus, we expect any weakness to be short-lived.” (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Here are some stats to think about regarding S&P 500 performance in June: Since 1950, June is the 4th worst month of the year (September, February, and August are worse). It has been higher the past 5 years in a row, the longest since a stretch of 6 in a row in the late 1990s. The past 10 years, though, June was up 1.0% on average, ranking as the 7th best month. According to Sam Stovall of CFRA, only 5 market declines in excess of 5% started in June versus an average of 8 for all 12 months (since WWII). In other words, it isn’t common for major market weakness to start in June. Building on this, when the S&P 500 is lower in June, it is down by 2.9% on average. This is the second smallest average loss, with only December better at -2.5%. We wouldn’t be surprised at all if stocks took a well-deserved break in June, but this month is rather misunderstood, as a massive sell-off or the start of significant weakness isn’t likely, as that isn’t what June typically brings. Lastly, last Wednesday marked the 100th trading day of the year for the S&P 500. In fact, the S&P 500 was up more than 10% on the 100th day, which historically is a great start to the year, but also has meant continued strong performance the rest of the year is quite normal. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when stocks are up more than 10% on day 100, the rest of the year has been higher 84.2% of the time and up 8.6% on average, both well above what the average year does. We continue to recommend an overweight to equities and underweight to fixed-income position relative to investors’ targets, as appropriate. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Less Than 20% Bearish For the First Time in 115 Weeks Bullish sentiment measured through the AAII weekly survey was at the lowest level since the fall last week, but after jumping 7.7 percentage points, it is now at the highest level since the end of April. Not only is it high relative to the past few weeks, but the increase also brings bullish sentiment 6 percentage points back above its historical average. Additionally, the week over week increase was the largest since the week of April 8th when the reading had risen 11.1 percentage points. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) In recent weeks, neutral sentiment had been surging; topping 37% last week for the highest reading since the first week of 2020. Although it reversed lower this week down to 36.2%, neutral sentiment remains around some of the strongest levels in over a year. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) With the pickup in bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment plummeted to 19.8% on a 6.6 percentage point decile; the largest since February. Falling below 20%, bearish sentiment took out its March and April lows and is now at the lowest level since January 2018. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Not only is that one of the lowest readings in bearish sentiment in recent history, but that drop below 20% brought to an end a 115-week long streak of readings in bearish sentiment above that level. As shown below, that surpassed a three-week shorter streak ending in December 2017 to make for the second-longest such streak on record. The longest streak which ended in December 2010 went on for more than twice as long as this most recent run. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Historically, lower readings in bearish sentiment have tended towards weaker performance for the S&P 500 going forward as shown below. But when it comes to the past times that bearish sentiment has broken below 20% for the first time in at least 50 weeks, performance has actually tended to consistently be positive. In fact, across each of the past six instances, the S&P 500 has been higher six months out every time. Granted, for the most part the typical move higher is usually smaller than other periods.

S&P 500 Returns Relative to History May has moved back to the rearview mirror and with that, we wanted to provide an update on how current long-term returns for the S&P 500 stack up relative to history. The chart below compares the trailing one, two, five, ten, and twenty-year annualized total returns of the S&P 500 to the S&P 500's historical average returns over those same time periods since 1928. We're starting to move away from the 'easy comps' in terms of market returns relative to the March 2020 lows, but the S&P 500 is still up more than 40% over the last 12 months which is nearly four times the historical average one year return. Over the last two years, the S&P 500's annualized return of 25.8% still comes in at more than twice the historical average of 10.6%. On a five and ten-year basis, the S&P 500's annualized gain also remains comfortably above 10%. All in all, the last decade has been very good for US equity investors. The only time period where the S&P 500 has experienced below-average returns is at the 20-year window where the 8.4% annualized gain clocks in at 2.5 percentage less than the historical average of 10.9%. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) The chart below compares the S&P 500's current returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to all other periods on a percentile basis. With mostly above-average returns, it comes as no surprise that most of the percentile readings rank above the 50th percentile, and for most time periods, the percentile rank comes in well above 50%. The one-year total return of more than 40% actually ranks just above the 93rd percentile, while the two-year return isn't far from the 90th percentile either. Moving further out, each of the other readings going out to ten years are all well above the 50th percentile. The only percentile rank below the 50th percentile is the 20-year window and that reading isn't even close. On the one hand, the last ten years have been phenomenal for equity investors, but the last 20 years haven't even been mediocre. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Throughout history, many investors have always worked under the assumption that long-term returns for the equity market are about 10%. History has shown that to be the case over the last decade at least, as the average annualized one-year gain of the S&P 500 has been well above 10%. With the S&P 500's current 20-year annualized gain currently at just 8.4%, though, what will it take for the S&P 500 to reach double-digit gains on an annualized basis over a 20-year window? For an idea, given the strong performance of the last ten years, a number of commentators suggest that the next ten years for equities will be weak with a reversion to the mean. Only time will tell, but if we operate under the (unlikely) assumption that the S&P 500 stays at the exact same level it is now going forward for the next ten years, its annualized twenty-year return would top 10% for the first time since August 2008 next September. After that brief period above 10% from September 2022 through March 2023, it wouldn't again top that level until February 2029. In spite of the fact that the annualized 20-year return would top 10% in those two periods, though, it still wouldn't get as high as the historical average of 10.9% in either of those periods. This reflects the fact that although the last ten years for US equities have been very strong, they also came shortly after one of the worst ten-year periods for US equities on record.

,"Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 7th, 2021. AMC, meme stocks could spark more heat in the week ahead as investors await inflation news - (Source) Inflation data is a highlight of the week ahead, as investors focus on economic news in the void between earnings season and the next Fed meeting. May’s consumer price index is scheduled to be reported Thursday, and it could be hot after it surged in April. Inflation is viewed as an important trigger that could cause the Federal Reserve to step back from its easy policies, if rising prices appear to be hotter and more persistent than expected. Equities were higher in the past week, but the meme stocks were far hotter. AMC Entertainment gained another 100% and was up 2,700% since January. Energy was the best-performing major sector, gaining more than 6.7% as oil prices jumped nearly 5% in the past week. REITs were the second-best performer, up 3.1%, followed by financials, up 1.2% and technology, also up 1.2%. But it’s the meme stocks that took the headlines, and also contributed to concerns about froth in the stock market. “People think this is new. It completely isn’t,” Dan Niles, founder of Satori Fund, said of the trading frenzy. He noted there was similar froth in individual stocks in 1999, when companies added dot-com to their names to attract investor attention. “What’s new is the fact that these traders are armed with stimulus checks. They can organize more easily on things like WallStreetBets, they can work from home, and there’s no-cost trading. Those are the differences,” Niles said on CNBC. “So, if it gets people interested in investing, that’s great. What I don’t like is when you have people sort of taking out mortgages on their home, and putting themselves at risk if the thing collapsed,” he added. “You want to be able to invest what you can afford to lose if you’re going to play in something like this.” Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities, said the trading in names like GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond is one of the things that has made him more cautious about the market. He said the high valuations on the meme names are unlikely to last. “It’s going to be around as long as cicadas are,” he said. The S&P 500 in the past week gained 0.6%, rising to 4,229, just 9 points from its all-time high. The Dow was up 0.7% to 34,756, and the Nasdaq gained 0.5% to 13,814. Watching the inflation signs Massocca said investors should stay focused on things like inflation, since that could be what makes the Federal Reserve reverse its easy policy. The Fed has so far said it sees the higher inflation readings as transitory. Economists expect CPI to be up 4.7% year over year, after April’s 4.2% pace, according to Dow Jones. Core inflation is expected to be up 0.4% for the month and 3.4% year over year. “I’m getting nervous. I’m seeing signs of a top. I’m systematically raising cash. I think the market looks too expensive,” Massocca said. “We’re going to shake off the dust from Covid. The economy is going to be very, very good and as a rule, I think monetary policy is going to respond to some degree.” He said the memes mania is just one sign, but the spark for a sell-off could be anything including a hawkish comment from the Fed. “Who knows what it is, but the kindling is building and as soon as a match hits it, the market is setting up for a 7% to 10% pullback at some point,” he said. “Who knows what starts it. ... One of the candidates very likely will be some kind of reductions in monetary policy.” Fear of the Fed stepping back from its easy policy has been hanging over the market. Friday’s May employment report was being watched closely, but the lower-than-expected job gains reinforced that the Fed could continue to hold off on policy changes for the time being. There were 559,000 jobs added in May, well below the 671,000 expected. Now the CPI report is the next point of focus, ahead of the Fed’s June 15-16 meeting. The question is, will it be so hot that the central bank may have to reassess its view about the temporary nature of inflation, or could it show that price increases are peaking? “There’s inflation out there. You can see it everywhere,” said Massocca. Taper talk The market has been expecting the Fed to begin to talk about unwinding its bond buying later this year, with many strategists targeting the Fed’s Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium at the end of August. The Fed is expected to first discuss cutting back its purchases months ahead of taking action. Then it will slowly reduce its buying. After that, it could consider interest rate hikes, now not expected by the market until 2023. Niles said the meme stock trend has been fueled in part by the Fed. The markets are awash in liquidity as the central bank keeps rates at zero and maintains its monthly purchases of at least $120 billion in Treasury and mortgage securities. “When the Fed backs off of that with tapering, I think that’s when you can go in and say, ‘OK’ we can potentially go after and short some of these highly valued names because that’s when the free money disappears and you actually start to contract some of that free money,” he said. “That’s when things start to get dangerous to the downside.” For now, Niles said he’s staying away from the names that are heavily sought by retail investors or have large short interest and are targeted by Wall Street. “You want to stay away from this stuff now unless you’re doing it in very small size,” he said. There are just a few earnings in the week ahead. One of the handful of names reporting is meme name GameStop on Wednesday. Campbell Soup also reports that day, and Chewy reports Thursday. G-7 finance ministers meet this weekend, and President Joe Biden will attend a meeting of the organization’s leaders in Cornwall, England, on Friday.

May Payrolls Not Too Hot, Not Too Cold Before diving into today’s jobs report for May, it will be a useful exercise to recall the curveball that April’s report threw at investors. One of the more hotly contested topics investors have been debating recently is what to make of the jobs report released one month ago, where the consensus expectation was for 1,000,000 new jobs and we only got 266,000 (since revised up to 278,000). On the one hand, data releases are volatile by nature and it is possible that the large miss could have been broadly dismissed as a “one off” among a package of otherwise very healthy economic data. On the other hand, it did confirm anecdotal evidence of difficult hiring conditions facing companies and reinforced the notion that some workers may be reluctant to return to the workforce for a whole host of reasons. Moreover, if the April report really did unearth new evidence of a weaker-than-expected jobs market in this latter scenario, should we view the effect as temporary or does it have staying power that could spell new trouble for the overall economic recovery? Against this backdrop, investors were hoping that today’s May jobs report would go a long way towards providing some definitive answers to these important questions. It did not. But, that might actually be a good thing. Here are some key takeaways: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ May employment report revealed that the domestic economy added 559,000 jobs in May, slightly below Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ median forecast for a gain of 675,000. The prior two months also received net positive revisions of 27,000 jobs. The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 5.8%, though that was paired with a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate, which moved from 61.7% to 61.6%. Average hourly earnings rose 0.5% month over month, again signaling lower-wage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected. More new lower-wage jobs would be expected to put more downward pressure on wage increases. “It is hard to view 559,000 added jobs as a disappointment, but it does leave something to be desired,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market > Strategist Ryan Detrick. “There is strong potential for job prints in excess of one million over the coming months, but the truth is as strong as the economy is right now, the employment backdrop is clearly lagging what we were all expecting just a few months ago.” As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, May’s jobs number did jump above April’s disappointment, but still came well short of making a fresh new high for 2021. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Where do we go from here? The US economy is still 7.6 million total payrolls shy of its peak prior to the recession, and given the magnitude of that number, we still believe there is the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months. Several catalysts should also lend a helping hand in the near future. Enhanced unemployment benefits may be deterring lower-wage workers from returning to the labor market, as they reduce the relative attractiveness of a paycheck from an employer. In the last month, about half of all states have started eliminating these added benefits in order to reduce the disincentive. We believe this should show up in the data starting with the June employment report. Also, schools might be closing for the summer, but daycare centers are reopening more broadly, freeing parents up to find jobs. Warmer weather, ever-improving vaccination trends, and increasing comfort reengaging in normal activities should all play their parts as well. The labor market will always be inextricably linked to the inflation outlook, this cycle perhaps more than past cycles, and for many that is the real story today. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has made it clear it will tolerate near-term inflation overshoots in order to achieve “substantial further progress” towards its employment goals before it begins taking measures to combat higher inflation. Recent hotter-than-expected inflation reports have increasingly turned the spotlight towards the Fed’s timeline for reducing their asset purchases, which, given their stated position, will depend on strong payroll reports. As such, we find ourselves (to a degree) in a “good news is bad news” scenario, as strong labor market readings could hasten the Fed’s timetable to begin normalizing monetary policy. Today’s report likely did little to convince the Fed that the labor market is closer to meeting its “substantial further progress” goal on employment, and therefore, all else equal, will not compel them to consider reducing asset purchases sooner rather than later. There is much ground still to be made up in the labor market, and we believe the Fed will need to see a string of strong reports, likely in the one million range, before it begins to take action. From a Fed intervention standpoint, today’s employment report likely found a sweet spot, and the early indications are that equity markets are breathing a sigh of relief. For a deeper dive into the inflation picture, check the blog on Thursday, June 10, when data for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation is set to be released. Big First 5 Months Gains Consolidate Over Worst Months S&P 500 is up an impressive 11.9% for the first five months of 2021. That is the 16th best gain for the first five months since 1950. As illustrated in the graph above, gains do beget gains and this bodes well for the year as a whole. But this does not diminish the seasonal pattern of consolidation and mostly sideways market action over the Worst Six Months May-October and even more so over the Worst Four Months July-October. We tabulated the gains for the top 20 first five month gains since 1950 and the gains for the last seven months of the year are still pretty solid averaging 9.4% vs. 14.7% for the top 20 first five months. But the bulk of those gains as you can see in the graph come from late-October to yearend. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) June Swoon? Although there was some notable weakness in the middle of May, the S&P 500 Index was able to rally late in the month to finish with a modest gain. Incredibly, this was the eighth year out of the past nine that stocks gained during in May. Who said Sell in May? (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) As we noted a month ago, the worst six months of the year indeed are May through October, so we are still in the thick of a potentially challenging period based on seasonality. “After a nearly 90% rally off the lows, stocks could be ripe for a pullback, especially during the historically weak month of June,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But with the improving economy, coupled with historic fiscal and monetary stimulus, we expect any weakness to be short-lived.” (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Here are some stats to think about regarding S&P 500 performance in June: Since 1950, June is the 4th worst month of the year (September, February, and August are worse). It has been higher the past 5 years in a row, the longest since a stretch of 6 in a row in the late 1990s. The past 10 years, though, June was up 1.0% on average, ranking as the 7th best month. According to Sam Stovall of CFRA, only 5 market declines in excess of 5% started in June versus an average of 8 for all 12 months (since WWII). In other words, it isn’t common for major market weakness to start in June. Building on this, when the S&P 500 is lower in June, it is down by 2.9% on average. This is the second smallest average loss, with only December better at -2.5%. We wouldn’t be surprised at all if stocks took a well-deserved break in June, but this month is rather misunderstood, as a massive sell-off or the start of significant weakness isn’t likely, as that isn’t what June typically brings. Lastly, last Wednesday marked the 100th trading day of the year for the S&P 500. In fact, the S&P 500 was up more than 10% on the 100th day, which historically is a great start to the year, but also has meant continued strong performance the rest of the year is quite normal. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when stocks are up more than 10% on day 100, the rest of the year has been higher 84.2% of the time and up 8.6% on average, both well above what the average year does. We continue to recommend an overweight to equities and underweight to fixed-income position relative to investors’ targets, as appropriate. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Less Than 20% Bearish For the First Time in 115 Weeks Bullish sentiment measured through the AAII weekly survey was at the lowest level since the fall last week, but after jumping 7.7 percentage points, it is now at the highest level since the end of April. Not only is it high relative to the past few weeks, but the increase also brings bullish sentiment 6 percentage points back above its historical average. Additionally, the week over week increase was the largest since the week of April 8th when the reading had risen 11.1 percentage points. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) In recent weeks, neutral sentiment had been surging; topping 37% last week for the highest reading since the first week of 2020. Although it reversed lower this week down to 36.2%, neutral sentiment remains around some of the strongest levels in over a year. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) With the pickup in bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment plummeted to 19.8% on a 6.6 percentage point decile; the largest since February. Falling below 20%, bearish sentiment took out its March and April lows and is now at the lowest level since January 2018. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Not only is that one of the lowest readings in bearish sentiment in recent history, but that drop below 20% brought to an end a 115-week long streak of readings in bearish sentiment above that level. As shown below, that surpassed a three-week shorter streak ending in December 2017 to make for the second-longest such streak on record. The longest streak which ended in December 2010 went on for more than twice as long as this most recent run. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Historically, lower readings in bearish sentiment have tended towards weaker performance for the S&P 500 going forward as shown below. But when it comes to the past times that bearish sentiment has broken below 20% for the first time in at least 50 weeks, performance has actually tended to consistently be positive. In fact, across each of the past six instances, the S&P 500 has been higher six months out every time. Granted, for the most part the typical move higher is usually smaller than other periods. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Typical June Trading: Any Early Gains Tend to Fade Especially After Mid-Month Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-caps. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Main Street Sentiment Strongest in Over a Decade The U.S. economy is opening up and overall sentiment on Main Street is the strongest it’s been since our earliest analysis in 2005, according to LPL Research’s proprietary Beige Book Barometer (BBB). The result is based on our analysis of the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, a publication released two weeks before each Fed policy meeting that captures qualitative observations made by community bankers and business owners—what we like to think of as “Main Street” rather than “Wall Street.” The BBB gauges Main Street’s sentiment by looking at how frequently key words and phrases appear in the text. In the most recent Beige Book, “strong” words were near their highest since we first began tracking data in 2005 while weak words were their lowest on record, resulting in the strongest overall sentiment reading since inception. The strong reading is likely driven more by a change in direction than in overall activity, but even that is a welcome shift. “The country and the economy are going through a disruptive but positive change as most COVID-related restrictions are lifted and the economy reopens,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Sentiment is up and that’s a great sign for the direction of the economy.” (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) This was an important Beige Book in other ways. Mentions of COVID-related words (virus, COVID, pandemic) fell to their lowest level since the March 2020 Beige Book, when the words first started to appear. More concerning, words related to inflation also rose to their highest level since our earliest analysis. The downside of the economy’s rapid acceleration has been a mismatch between demand, which can ramp up quickly, and supply, which comes on line more slowly, while labor markets have also been slow to keep pace with reopening. Overall, the fundamental backdrop for the economy remains positive. Supply chain disruptions can slow the pace of the economic rebound but are likely temporary, while we expect reopening to be enduring. There is still some risk around variants, however, and full supply chain relief will likely need support from accelerated global vaccine distribution. US economic acceleration will probably peak in the second quarter, but there’s still plenty of scope for growth to moderate and still remain above average. Much of the positive news is already priced in for equity markets, which are forward looking, and gains may not come as easily, but we still see solid potential for upside as the economy continues to rebound. S&P 500 Returns Relative to History May has moved back to the rearview mirror and with that, we wanted to provide an update on how current long-term returns for the S&P 500 stack up relative to history. The chart below compares the trailing one, two, five, ten, and twenty-year annualized total returns of the S&P 500 to the S&P 500's historical average returns over those same time periods since 1928. We're starting to move away from the 'easy comps' in terms of market returns relative to the March 2020 lows, but the S&P 500 is still up more than 40% over the last 12 months which is nearly four times the historical average one year return. Over the last two years, the S&P 500's annualized return of 25.8% still comes in at more than twice the historical average of 10.6%. On a five and ten-year basis, the S&P 500's annualized gain also remains comfortably above 10%. All in all, the last decade has been very good for US equity investors. The only time period where the S&P 500 has experienced below-average returns is at the 20-year window where the 8.4% annualized gain clocks in at 2.5 percentage less than the historical average of 10.9%. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) The chart below compares the S&P 500's current returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to all other periods on a percentile basis. With mostly above-average returns, it comes as no surprise that most of the percentile readings rank above the 50th percentile, and for most time periods, the percentile rank comes in well above 50%. The one-year total return of more than 40% actually ranks just above the 93rd percentile, while the two-year return isn't far from the 90th percentile either. Moving further out, each of the other readings going out to ten years are all well above the 50th percentile. The only percentile rank below the 50th percentile is the 20-year window and that reading isn't even close. On the one hand, the last ten years have been phenomenal for equity investors, but the last 20 years haven't even been mediocre. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Throughout history, many investors have always worked under the assumption that long-term returns for the equity market are about 10%. History has shown that to be the case over the last decade at least, as the average annualized one-year gain of the S&P 500 has been well above 10%. With the S&P 500's current 20-year annualized gain currently at just 8.4%, though, what will it take for the S&P 500 to reach double-digit gains on an annualized basis over a 20-year window? For an idea, given the strong performance of the last ten years, a number of commentators suggest that the next ten years for equities will be weak with a reversion to the mean. Only time will tell, but if we operate under the (unlikely) assumption that the S&P 500 stays at the exact same level it is now going forward for the next ten years, its annualized twenty-year return would top 10% for the first time since August 2008 next September. After that brief period above 10% from September 2022 through March 2023, it wouldn't again top that level until February 2029. In spite of the fact that the annualized 20-year return would top 10% in those two periods, though, it still wouldn't get as high as the historical average of 10.9% in either of those periods. This reflects the fact that although the last ten years for US equities have been very strong, they also came shortly after one of the worst ten-year periods for US equities on record.

Core inflation is expected to be up 0.4% for the month and 3.4% year over year. “I’m getting nervous. I’m seeing signs of a top. I’m systematically raising cash. I think the market looks too expensive,” Massocca said. “We’re going to shake off the dust from Covid. The economy is going to be very, very good and as a rule, I think monetary policy is going to respond to some degree.” He said the memes mania is just one sign, but the spark for a sell-off could be anything including a hawkish comment from the Fed. “Who knows what it is, but the kindling is building and as soon as a match hits it, the market is setting up for a 7% to 10% pullback at some point,” he said. “Who knows what starts it. ... One of the candidates very likely will be some kind of reductions in monetary policy.” Fear of the Fed stepping back from its easy policy has been hanging over the market. Friday’s May employment report was being watched closely, but the lower-than-expected job gains reinforced that the Fed could continue to hold off on policy changes for the time being. There were 559,000 jobs added in May, well below the 671,000 expected. Now the CPI report is the next point of focus, ahead of the Fed’s June 15-16 meeting. The question is, will it be so hot that the central bank may have to reassess its view about the temporary nature of inflation, or could it show that price increases are peaking? “There’s inflation out there. You can see it everywhere,” said Massocca. Taper talk The market has been expecting the Fed to begin to talk about unwinding its bond buying later this year, with many strategists targeting the Fed’s Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium at the end of August. The Fed is expected to first discuss cutting back its purchases months ahead of taking action. Then it will slowly reduce its buying. After that, it could consider interest rate hikes, now not expected by the market until 2023. Niles said the meme stock trend has been fueled in part by the Fed. The markets are awash in liquidity as the central bank keeps rates at zero and maintains its monthly purchases of at least $120 billion in Treasury and mortgage securities. “When the Fed backs off of that with tapering, I think that’s when you can go in and say, ‘OK’ we can potentially go after and short some of these highly valued names because that’s when the free money disappears and you actually start to contract some of that free money,” he said. “That’s when things start to get dangerous to the downside.” For now, Niles said he’s staying away from the names that are heavily sought by retail investors or have large short interest and are targeted by Wall Street. “You want to stay away from this stuff now unless you’re doing it in very small size,” he said. There are just a few earnings in the week ahead. One of the handful of names reporting is meme name GameStop on Wednesday. Campbell Soup also reports that day, and Chewy reports Thursday. G-7 finance ministers meet this weekend, and President Joe Biden will attend a meeting of the organization’s leaders in Cornwall, England, on Friday.

May Payrolls Not Too Hot, Not Too Cold Before diving into today’s jobs report for May, it will be a useful exercise to recall the curveball that April’s report threw at investors. One of the more hotly contested topics investors have been debating recently is what to make of the jobs report released one month ago, where the consensus expectation was for 1,000,000 new jobs and we only got 266,000 (since revised up to 278,000). On the one hand, data releases are volatile by nature and it is possible that the large miss could have been broadly dismissed as a “one off” among a package of otherwise very healthy economic data. On the other hand, it did confirm anecdotal evidence of difficult hiring conditions facing companies and reinforced the notion that some workers may be reluctant to return to the workforce for a whole host of reasons. Moreover, if the April report really did unearth new evidence of a weaker-than-expected jobs market in this latter scenario, should we view the effect as temporary or does it have staying power that could spell new trouble for the overall economic recovery? Against this backdrop, investors were hoping that today’s May jobs report would go a long way towards providing some definitive answers to these important questions. It did not. But, that might actually be a good thing. Here are some key takeaways: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ May employment report revealed that the domestic economy added 559,000 jobs in May, slightly below Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ median forecast for a gain of 675,000. The prior two months also received net positive revisions of 27,000 jobs. The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 5.8%, though that was paired with a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate, which moved from 61.7% to 61.6%. Average hourly earnings rose 0.5% month over month, again signaling lower-wage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected. More new lower-wage jobs would be expected to put more downward pressure on wage increases. “It is hard to view 559,000 added jobs as a disappointment, but it does leave something to be desired,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market > Strategist Ryan Detrick. “There is strong potential for job prints in excess of one million over the coming months, but the truth is as strong as the economy is right now, the employment backdrop is clearly lagging what we were all expecting just a few months ago.” As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, May’s jobs number did jump above April’s disappointment, but still came well short of making a fresh new high for 2021. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Where do we go from here? The US economy is still 7.6 million total payrolls shy of its peak prior to the recession, and given the magnitude of that number, we still believe there is the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months. Several catalysts should also lend a helping hand in the near future. Enhanced unemployment benefits may be deterring lower-wage workers from returning to the labor market, as they reduce the relative attractiveness of a paycheck from an employer. In the last month, about half of all states have started eliminating these added benefits in order to reduce the disincentive. We believe this should show up in the data starting with the June employment report. Also, schools might be closing for the summer, but daycare centers are reopening more broadly, freeing parents up to find jobs. Warmer weather, ever-improving vaccination trends, and increasing comfort reengaging in normal activities should all play their parts as well. The labor market will always be inextricably linked to the inflation outlook, this cycle perhaps more than past cycles, and for many that is the real story today. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has made it clear it will tolerate near-term inflation overshoots in order to achieve “substantial further progress” towards its employment goals before it begins taking measures to combat higher inflation. Recent hotter-than-expected inflation reports have increasingly turned the spotlight towards the Fed’s timeline for reducing their asset purchases, which, given their stated position, will depend on strong payroll reports. As such, we find ourselves (to a degree) in a “good news is bad news” scenario, as strong labor market readings could hasten the Fed’s timetable to begin normalizing monetary policy. Today’s report likely did little to convince the Fed that the labor market is closer to meeting its “substantial further progress” goal on employment, and therefore, all else equal, will not compel them to consider reducing asset purchases sooner rather than later. There is much ground still to be made up in the labor market, and we believe the Fed will need to see a string of strong reports, likely in the one million range, before it begins to take action. From a Fed intervention standpoint, today’s employment report likely found a sweet spot, and the early indications are that equity markets are breathing a sigh of relief. For a deeper dive into the inflation picture, check the blog on Thursday, June 10, when data for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation is set to be released. Big First 5 Months Gains Consolidate Over Worst Months S&P 500 is up an impressive 11.9% for the first five months of 2021. That is the 16th best gain for the first five months since 1950. As illustrated in the graph above, gains do beget gains and this bodes well for the year as a whole. But this does not diminish the seasonal pattern of consolidation and mostly sideways market action over the Worst Six Months May-October and even more so over the Worst Four Months July-October. We tabulated the gains for the top 20 first five month gains since 1950 and the gains for the last seven months of the year are still pretty solid averaging 9.4% vs. 14.7% for the top 20 first five months. But the bulk of those gains as you can see in the graph come from late-October to yearend. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) June Swoon? Although there was some notable weakness in the middle of May, the S&P 500 Index was able to rally late in the month to finish with a modest gain. Incredibly, this was the eighth year out of the past nine that stocks gained during in May. Who said Sell in May? (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) As we noted a month ago, the worst six months of the year indeed are May through October, so we are still in the thick of a potentially challenging period based on seasonality. “After a nearly 90% rally off the lows, stocks could be ripe for a pullback, especially during the historically weak month of June,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But with the improving economy, coupled with historic fiscal and monetary stimulus, we expect any weakness to be short-lived.” (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Here are some stats to think about regarding S&P 500 performance in June: Since 1950, June is the 4th worst month of the year (September, February, and August are worse). It has been higher the past 5 years in a row, the longest since a stretch of 6 in a row in the late 1990s. The past 10 years, though, June was up 1.0% on average, ranking as the 7th best month. According to Sam Stovall of CFRA, only 5 market declines in excess of 5% started in June versus an average of 8 for all 12 months (since WWII). In other words, it isn’t common for major market weakness to start in June. Building on this, when the S&P 500 is lower in June, it is down by 2.9% on average. This is the second smallest average loss, with only December better at -2.5%. We wouldn’t be surprised at all if stocks took a well-deserved break in June, but this month is rather misunderstood, as a massive sell-off or the start of significant weakness isn’t likely, as that isn’t what June typically brings. Lastly, last Wednesday marked the 100th trading day of the year for the S&P 500. In fact, the S&P 500 was up more than 10% on the 100th day, which historically is a great start to the year, but also has meant continued strong performance the rest of the year is quite normal. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when stocks are up more than 10% on day 100, the rest of the year has been higher 84.2% of the time and up 8.6% on average, both well above what the average year does. We continue to recommend an overweight to equities and underweight to fixed-income position relative to investors’ targets, as appropriate. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Less Than 20% Bearish For the First Time in 115 Weeks Bullish sentiment measured through the AAII weekly survey was at the lowest level since the fall last week, but after jumping 7.7 percentage points, it is now at the highest level since the end of April. Not only is it high relative to the past few weeks, but the increase also brings bullish sentiment 6 percentage points back above its historical average. Additionally, the week over week increase was the largest since the week of April 8th when the reading had risen 11.1 percentage points. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) In recent weeks, neutral sentiment had been surging; topping 37% last week for the highest reading since the first week of 2020. Although it reversed lower this week down to 36.2%, neutral sentiment remains around some of the strongest levels in over a year. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) With the pickup in bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment plummeted to 19.8% on a 6.6 percentage point decile; the largest since February. Falling below 20%, bearish sentiment took out its March and April lows and is now at the lowest level since January 2018. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Not only is that one of the lowest readings in bearish sentiment in recent history, but that drop below 20% brought to an end a 115-week long streak of readings in bearish sentiment above that level. As shown below, that surpassed a three-week shorter streak ending in December 2017 to make for the second-longest such streak on record. The longest streak which ended in December 2010 went on for more than twice as long as this most recent run. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Historically, lower readings in bearish sentiment have tended towards weaker performance for the S&P 500 going forward as shown below. But when it comes to the past times that bearish sentiment has broken below 20% for the first time in at least 50 weeks, performance has actually tended to consistently be positive. In fact, across each of the past six instances, the S&P 500 has been higher six months out every time. Granted, for the most part the typical move higher is usually smaller than other periods. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Typical June Trading: Any Early Gains Tend to Fade Especially After Mid-Month Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-caps. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Main Street Sentiment Strongest in Over a Decade The U.S. economy is opening up and overall sentiment on Main Street is the strongest it’s been since our earliest analysis in 2005, according to LPL Research’s proprietary Beige Book Barometer (BBB). The result is based on our analysis of the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, a publication released two weeks before each Fed policy meeting that captures qualitative observations made by community bankers and business owners—what we like to think of as “Main Street” rather than “Wall Street.” The BBB gauges Main Street’s sentiment by looking at how frequently key words and phrases appear in the text. In the most recent Beige Book, “strong” words were near their highest since we first began tracking data in 2005 while weak words were their lowest on record, resulting in the strongest overall sentiment reading since inception. The strong reading is likely driven more by a change in direction than in overall activity, but even that is a welcome shift. “The country and the economy are going through a disruptive but positive change as most COVID-related restrictions are lifted and the economy reopens,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Sentiment is up and that’s a great sign for the direction of the economy.” (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) This was an important Beige Book in other ways. Mentions of COVID-related words (virus, COVID, pandemic) fell to their lowest level since the March 2020 Beige Book, when the words first started to appear. More concerning, words related to inflation also rose to their highest level since our earliest analysis. The downside of the economy’s rapid acceleration has been a mismatch between demand, which can ramp up quickly, and supply, which comes on line more slowly, while labor markets have also been slow to keep pace with reopening. Overall, the fundamental backdrop for the economy remains positive. Supply chain disruptions can slow the pace of the economic rebound but are likely temporary, while we expect reopening to be enduring. There is still some risk around variants, however, and full supply chain relief will likely need support from accelerated global vaccine distribution. US economic acceleration will probably peak in the second quarter, but there’s still plenty of scope for growth to moderate and still remain above average. Much of the positive news is already priced in for equity markets, which are forward looking, and gains may not come as easily, but we still see solid potential for upside as the economy continues to rebound. S&P 500 Returns Relative to History May has moved back to the rearview mirror and with that, we wanted to provide an update on how current long-term returns for the S&P 500 stack up relative to history. The chart below compares the trailing one, two, five, ten, and twenty-year annualized total returns of the S&P 500 to the S&P 500's historical average returns over those same time periods since 1928. We're starting to move away from the 'easy comps' in terms of market returns relative to the March 2020 lows, but the S&P 500 is still up more than 40% over the last 12 months which is nearly four times the historical average one year return. Over the last two years, the S&P 500's annualized return of 25.8% still comes in at more than twice the historical average of 10.6%. On a five and ten-year basis, the S&P 500's annualized gain also remains comfortably above 10%. All in all, the last decade has been very good for US equity investors. The only time period where the S&P 500 has experienced below-average returns is at the 20-year window where the 8.4% annualized gain clocks in at 2.5 percentage less than the historical average of 10.9%. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) The chart below compares the S&P 500's current returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to all other periods on a percentile basis. With mostly above-average returns, it comes as no surprise that most of the percentile readings rank above the 50th percentile, and for most time periods, the percentile rank comes in well above 50%. The one-year total return of more than 40% actually ranks just above the 93rd percentile, while the two-year return isn't far from the 90th percentile either. Moving further out, each of the other readings going out to ten years are all well above the 50th percentile. The only percentile rank below the 50th percentile is the 20-year window and that reading isn't even close. On the one hand, the last ten years have been phenomenal for equity investors, but the last 20 years haven't even been mediocre. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Throughout history, many investors have always worked under the assumption that long-term returns for the equity market are about 10%. History has shown that to be the case over the last decade at least, as the average annualized one-year gain of the S&P 500 has been well above 10%. With the S&P 500's current 20-year annualized gain currently at just 8.4%, though, what will it take for the S&P 500 to reach double-digit gains on an annualized basis over a 20-year window? For an idea, given the strong performance of the last ten years, a number of commentators suggest that the next ten years for equities will be weak with a reversion to the mean. Only time will tell, but if we operate under the (unlikely) assumption that the S&P 500 stays at the exact same level it is now going forward for the next ten years, its annualized twenty-year return would top 10% for the first time since August 2008 next September. After that brief period above 10% from September 2022 through March 2023, it wouldn't again top that level until February 2029. In spite of the fact that the annualized 20-year return would top 10% in those two periods, though, it still wouldn't get as high as the historical average of 10.9% in either of those periods. This reflects the fact that although the last ten years for US equities have been very strong, they also came shortly after one of the worst ten-year periods for US equities on record.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 7th, 2021. AMC, meme stocks could spark more heat in the week ahead as investors await inflation news - (Source) Inflation data is a highlight of the week ahead, as investors focus on economic news in the void between earnings season and the next Fed meeting. May’s consumer price index is scheduled to be reported Thursday, and it could be hot after it surged in April. Inflation is viewed as an important trigger that could cause the Federal Reserve to step back from its easy policies, if rising prices appear to be hotter and more persistent than expected. Equities were higher in the past week, but the meme stocks were far hotter. AMC Entertainment gained another 100% and was up 2,700% since January. Energy was the best-performing major sector, gaining more than 6.7% as oil prices jumped nearly 5% in the past week. REITs were the second-best performer, up 3.1%, followed by financials, up 1.2% and technology, also up 1.2%. But it’s the meme stocks that took the headlines, and also contributed to concerns about froth in the stock market. “People think this is new. It completely isn’t,” Dan Niles, founder of Satori Fund, said of the trading frenzy. He noted there was similar froth in individual stocks in 1999, when companies added dot-com to their names to attract investor attention. “What’s new is the fact that these traders are armed with stimulus checks. They can organize more easily on things like WallStreetBets, they can work from home, and there’s no-cost trading. Those are the differences,” Niles said on CNBC. “So, if it gets people interested in investing, that’s great. What I don’t like is when you have people sort of taking out mortgages on their home, and putting themselves at risk if the thing collapsed,” he added. “You want to be able to invest what you can afford to lose if you’re going to play in something like this.” Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities, said the trading in names like GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond is one of the things that has made him more cautious about the market. He said the high valuations on the meme names are unlikely to last. “It’s going to be around as long as cicadas are,” he said. The S&P 500 in the past week gained 0.6%, rising to 4,229, just 9 points from its all-time high. The Dow was up 0.7% to 34,756, and the Nasdaq gained 0.5% to 13,814. Watching the inflation signs Massocca said investors should stay focused on things like inflation, since that could be what makes the Federal Reserve reverse its easy policy. The Fed has so far said it sees the higher inflation readings as transitory. Economists expect CPI to be up 4.7% year over year, after April’s 4.2% pace, according to Dow Jones. Core inflation is expected to be up 0.4% for the month and 3.4% year over year. “I’m getting nervous. I’m seeing signs of a top. I’m systematically raising cash. I think the market looks too expensive,” Massocca said. “We’re going to shake off the dust from Covid. The economy is going to be very, very good and as a rule, I think monetary policy is going to respond to some degree.” He said the memes mania is just one sign, but the spark for a sell-off could be anything including a hawkish comment from the Fed. “Who knows what it is, but the kindling is building and as soon as a match hits it, the market is setting up for a 7% to 10% pullback at some point,” he said. “Who knows what starts it. ... One of the candidates very likely will be some kind of reductions in monetary policy.” Fear of the Fed stepping back from its easy policy has been hanging over the market. Friday’s May employment report was being watched closely, but the lower-than-expected job gains reinforced that the Fed could continue to hold off on policy changes for the time being. There were 559,000 jobs added in May, well below the 671,000 expected. Now the CPI report is the next point of focus, ahead of the Fed’s June 15-16 meeting. The question is, will it be so hot that the central bank may have to reassess its view about the temporary nature of inflation, or could it show that price increases are peaking? “There’s inflation out there. You can see it everywhere,” said Massocca. Taper talk The market has been expecting the Fed to begin to talk about unwinding its bond buying later this year, with many strategists targeting the Fed’s Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium at the end of August. The Fed is expected to first discuss cutting back its purchases months ahead of taking action. Then it will slowly reduce its buying. After that, it could consider interest rate hikes, now not expected by the market until 2023. Niles said the meme stock trend has been fueled in part by the Fed. The markets are awash in liquidity as the central bank keeps rates at zero and maintains its monthly purchases of at least $120 billion in Treasury and mortgage securities. “When the Fed backs off of that with tapering, I think that’s when you can go in and say, ‘OK’ we can potentially go after and short some of these highly valued names because that’s when the free money disappears and you actually start to contract some of that free money,” he said. “That’s when things start to get dangerous to the downside.” For now, Niles said he’s staying away from the names that are heavily sought by retail investors or have large short interest and are targeted by Wall Street. “You want to stay away from this stuff now unless you’re doing it in very small size,” he said. There are just a few earnings in the week ahead. One of the handful of names reporting is meme name GameStop on Wednesday. Campbell Soup also reports that day, and Chewy reports Thursday.

More new lower-wage jobs would be expected to put more downward pressure on wage increases. “It is hard to view 559,000 added jobs as a disappointment, but it does leave something to be desired,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market > Strategist Ryan Detrick. “There is strong potential for job prints in excess of one million over the coming months, but the truth is as strong as the economy is right now, the employment backdrop is clearly lagging what we were all expecting just a few months ago.” As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, May’s jobs number did jump above April’s disappointment, but still came well short of making a fresh new high for 2021. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Where do we go from here? The US economy is still 7.6 million total payrolls shy of its peak prior to the recession, and given the magnitude of that number, we still believe there is the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months. Several catalysts should also lend a helping hand in the near future. Enhanced unemployment benefits may be deterring lower-wage workers from returning to the labor market, as they reduce the relative attractiveness of a paycheck from an employer. In the last month, about half of all states have started eliminating these added benefits in order to reduce the disincentive. We believe this should show up in the data starting with the June employment report. Also, schools might be closing for the summer, but daycare centers are reopening more broadly, freeing parents up to find jobs. Warmer weather, ever-improving vaccination trends, and increasing comfort reengaging in normal activities should all play their parts as well. The labor market will always be inextricably linked to the inflation outlook, this cycle perhaps more than past cycles, and for many that is the real story today. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has made it clear it will tolerate near-term inflation overshoots in order to achieve “substantial further progress” towards its employment goals before it begins taking measures to combat higher inflation. Recent hotter-than-expected inflation reports have increasingly turned the spotlight towards the Fed’s timeline for reducing their asset purchases, which, given their stated position, will depend on strong payroll reports. As such, we find ourselves (to a degree) in a “good news is bad news” scenario, as strong labor market readings could hasten the Fed’s timetable to begin normalizing monetary policy. Today’s report likely did little to convince the Fed that the labor market is closer to meeting its “substantial further progress” goal on employment, and therefore, all else equal, will not compel them to consider reducing asset purchases sooner rather than later. There is much ground still to be made up in the labor market, and we believe the Fed will need to see a string of strong reports, likely in the one million range, before it begins to take action. From a Fed intervention standpoint, today’s employment report likely found a sweet spot, and the early indications are that equity markets are breathing a sigh of relief. For a deeper dive into the inflation picture, check the blog on Thursday, June 10, when data for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation is set to be released. Big First 5 Months Gains Consolidate Over Worst Months S&P 500 is up an impressive 11.9% for the first five months of 2021. That is the 16th best gain for the first five months since 1950. As illustrated in the graph above, gains do beget gains and this bodes well for the year as a whole. But this does not diminish the seasonal pattern of consolidation and mostly sideways market action over the Worst Six Months May-October and even more so over the Worst Four Months July-October. We tabulated the gains for the top 20 first five month gains since 1950 and the gains for the last seven months of the year are still pretty solid averaging 9.4% vs. 14.7% for the top 20 first five months. But the bulk of those gains as you can see in the graph come from late-October to yearend. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) June Swoon? Although there was some notable weakness in the middle of May, the S&P 500 Index was able to rally late in the month to finish with a modest gain. Incredibly, this was the eighth year out of the past nine that stocks gained during in May. Who said Sell in May? (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) As we noted a month ago, the worst six months of the year indeed are May through October, so we are still in the thick of a potentially challenging period based on seasonality. “After a nearly 90% rally off the lows, stocks could be ripe for a pullback, especially during the historically weak month of June,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But with the improving economy, coupled with historic fiscal and monetary stimulus, we expect any weakness to be short-lived.” (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Here are some stats to think about regarding S&P 500 performance in June: Since 1950, June is the 4th worst month of the year (September, February, and August are worse). It has been higher the past 5 years in a row, the longest since a stretch of 6 in a row in the late 1990s. The past 10 years, though, June was up 1.0% on average, ranking as the 7th best month. According to Sam Stovall of CFRA, only 5 market declines in excess of 5% started in June versus an average of 8 for all 12 months (since WWII). In other words, it isn’t common for major market weakness to start in June. Building on this, when the S&P 500 is lower in June, it is down by 2.9% on average. This is the second smallest average loss, with only December better at -2.5%. We wouldn’t be surprised at all if stocks took a well-deserved break in June, but this month is rather misunderstood, as a massive sell-off or the start of significant weakness isn’t likely, as that isn’t what June typically brings. Lastly, last Wednesday marked the 100th trading day of the year for the S&P 500. In fact, the S&P 500 was up more than 10% on the 100th day, which historically is a great start to the year, but also has meant continued strong performance the rest of the year is quite normal. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when stocks are up more than 10% on day 100, the rest of the year has been higher 84.2% of the time and up 8.6% on average, both well above what the average year does. We continue to recommend an overweight to equities and underweight to fixed-income position relative to investors’ targets, as appropriate. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Less Than 20% Bearish For the First Time in 115 Weeks Bullish sentiment measured through the AAII weekly survey was at the lowest level since the fall last week, but after jumping 7.7 percentage points, it is now at the highest level since the end of April. Not only is it high relative to the past few weeks, but the increase also brings bullish sentiment 6 percentage points back above its historical average. Additionally, the week over week increase was the largest since the week of April 8th when the reading had risen 11.1 percentage points. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) In recent weeks, neutral sentiment had been surging; topping 37% last week for the highest reading since the first week of 2020. Although it reversed lower this week down to 36.2%, neutral sentiment remains around some of the strongest levels in over a year. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) With the pickup in bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment plummeted to 19.8% on a 6.6 percentage point decile; the largest since February. Falling below 20%, bearish sentiment took out its March and April lows and is now at the lowest level since January 2018. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Not only is that one of the lowest readings in bearish sentiment in recent history, but that drop below 20% brought to an end a 115-week long streak of readings in bearish sentiment above that level. As shown below, that surpassed a three-week shorter streak ending in December 2017 to make for the second-longest such streak on record. The longest streak which ended in December 2010 went on for more than twice as long as this most recent run. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Historically, lower readings in bearish sentiment have tended towards weaker performance for the S&P 500 going forward as shown below. But when it comes to the past times that bearish sentiment has broken below 20% for the first time in at least 50 weeks, performance has actually tended to consistently be positive. In fact, across each of the past six instances, the S&P 500 has been higher six months out every time. Granted, for the most part the typical move higher is usually smaller than other periods. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Typical June Trading: Any Early Gains Tend to Fade Especially After Mid-Month Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-caps. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Main Street Sentiment Strongest in Over a Decade The U.S. economy is opening up and overall sentiment on Main Street is the strongest it’s been since our earliest analysis in 2005, according to LPL Research’s proprietary Beige Book Barometer (BBB). The result is based on our analysis of the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, a publication released two weeks before each Fed policy meeting that captures qualitative observations made by community bankers and business owners—what we like to think of as “Main Street” rather than “Wall Street.” The BBB gauges Main Street’s sentiment by looking at how frequently key words and phrases appear in the text. In the most recent Beige Book, “strong” words were near their highest since we first began tracking data in 2005 while weak words were their lowest on record, resulting in the strongest overall sentiment reading since inception. The strong reading is likely driven more by a change in direction than in overall activity, but even that is a welcome shift. “The country and the economy are going through a disruptive but positive change as most COVID-related restrictions are lifted and the economy reopens,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Sentiment is up and that’s a great sign for the direction of the economy.” (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) This was an important Beige Book in other ways. Mentions of COVID-related words (virus, COVID, pandemic) fell to their lowest level since the March 2020 Beige Book, when the words first started to appear. More concerning, words related to inflation also rose to their highest level since our earliest analysis. The downside of the economy’s rapid acceleration has been a mismatch between demand, which can ramp up quickly, and supply, which comes on line more slowly, while labor markets have also been slow to keep pace with reopening. Overall, the fundamental backdrop for the economy remains positive. Supply chain disruptions can slow the pace of the economic rebound but are likely temporary, while we expect reopening to be enduring. There is still some risk around variants, however, and full supply chain relief will likely need support from accelerated global vaccine distribution. US economic acceleration will probably peak in the second quarter, but there’s still plenty of scope for growth to moderate and still remain above average. Much of the positive news is already priced in for equity markets, which are forward looking, and gains may not come as easily, but we still see solid potential for upside as the economy continues to rebound. S&P 500 Returns Relative to History May has moved back to the rearview mirror and with that, we wanted to provide an update on how current long-term returns for the S&P 500 stack up relative to history. The chart below compares the trailing one, two, five, ten, and twenty-year annualized total returns of the S&P 500 to the S&P 500's historical average returns over those same time periods since 1928. We're starting to move away from the 'easy comps' in terms of market returns relative to the March 2020 lows, but the S&P 500 is still up more than 40% over the last 12 months which is nearly four times the historical average one year return. Over the last two years, the S&P 500's annualized return of 25.8% still comes in at more than twice the historical average of 10.6%. On a five and ten-year basis, the S&P 500's annualized gain also remains comfortably above 10%. All in all, the last decade has been very good for US equity investors. The only time period where the S&P 500 has experienced below-average returns is at the 20-year window where the 8.4% annualized gain clocks in at 2.5 percentage less than the historical average of 10.9%. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) The chart below compares the S&P 500's current returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to all other periods on a percentile basis. With mostly above-average returns, it comes as no surprise that most of the percentile readings rank above the 50th percentile, and for most time periods, the percentile rank comes in well above 50%. The one-year total return of more than 40% actually ranks just above the 93rd percentile, while the two-year return isn't far from the 90th percentile either. Moving further out, each of the other readings going out to ten years are all well above the 50th percentile. The only percentile rank below the 50th percentile is the 20-year window and that reading isn't even close. On the one hand, the last ten years have been phenomenal for equity investors, but the last 20 years haven't even been mediocre. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Throughout history, many investors have always worked under the assumption that long-term returns for the equity market are about 10%. History has shown that to be the case over the last decade at least, as the average annualized one-year gain of the S&P 500 has been well above 10%. With the S&P 500's current 20-year annualized gain currently at just 8.4%, though, what will it take for the S&P 500 to reach double-digit gains on an annualized basis over a 20-year window? For an idea, given the strong performance of the last ten years, a number of commentators suggest that the next ten years for equities will be weak with a reversion to the mean. Only time will tell, but if we operate under the (unlikely) assumption that the S&P 500 stays at the exact same level it is now going forward for the next ten years, its annualized twenty-year return would top 10% for the first time since August 2008 next September. After that brief period above 10% from September 2022 through March 2023, it wouldn't again top that level until February 2029. In spite of the fact that the annualized 20-year return would top 10% in those two periods, though, it still wouldn't get as high as the historical average of 10.9% in either of those periods. This reflects the fact that although the last ten years for US equities have been very strong, they also came shortly after one of the worst ten-year periods for US equities on record.

,"Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 7th, 2021. AMC, meme stocks could spark more heat in the week ahead as investors await inflation news - (Source) Inflation data is a highlight of the week ahead, as investors focus on economic news in the void between earnings season and the next Fed meeting. May’s consumer price index is scheduled to be reported Thursday, and it could be hot after it surged in April. Inflation is viewed as an important trigger that could cause the Federal Reserve to step back from its easy policies, if rising prices appear to be hotter and more persistent than expected. Equities were higher in the past week, but the meme stocks were far hotter. AMC Entertainment gained another 100% and was up 2,700% since January. Energy was the best-performing major sector, gaining more than 6.7% as oil prices jumped nearly 5% in the past week. REITs were the second-best performer, up 3.1%, followed by financials, up 1.2% and technology, also up 1.2%. But it’s the meme stocks that took the headlines, and also contributed to concerns about froth in the stock market. “People think this is new. It completely isn’t,” Dan Niles, founder of Satori Fund, said of the trading frenzy. He noted there was similar froth in individual stocks in 1999, when companies added dot-com to their names to attract investor attention. “What’s new is the fact that these traders are armed with stimulus checks. They can organize more easily on things like WallStreetBets, they can work from home, and there’s no-cost trading. Those are the differences,” Niles said on CNBC. “So, if it gets people interested in investing, that’s great. What I don’t like is when you have people sort of taking out mortgages on their home, and putting themselves at risk if the thing collapsed,” he added. “You want to be able to invest what you can afford to lose if you’re going to play in something like this.” Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities, said the trading in names like GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond is one of the things that has made him more cautious about the market. He said the high valuations on the meme names are unlikely to last. “It’s going to be around as long as cicadas are,” he said. The S&P 500 in the past week gained 0.6%, rising to 4,229, just 9 points from its all-time high. The Dow was up 0.7% to 34,756, and the Nasdaq gained 0.5% to 13,814. Watching the inflation signs Massocca said investors should stay focused on things like inflation, since that could be what makes the Federal Reserve reverse its easy policy. The Fed has so far said it sees the higher inflation readings as transitory. Economists expect CPI to be up 4.7% year over year, after April’s 4.2% pace, according to Dow Jones. Core inflation is expected to be up 0.4% for the month and 3.4% year over year. “I’m getting nervous. I’m seeing signs of a top. I’m systematically raising cash. I think the market looks too expensive,” Massocca said. “We’re going to shake off the dust from Covid. The economy is going to be very, very good and as a rule, I think monetary policy is going to respond to some degree.” He said the memes mania is just one sign, but the spark for a sell-off could be anything including a hawkish comment from the Fed. “Who knows what it is, but the kindling is building and as soon as a match hits it, the market is setting up for a 7% to 10% pullback at some point,” he said. “Who knows what starts it. ... One of the candidates very likely will be some kind of reductions in monetary policy.” Fear of the Fed stepping back from its easy policy has been hanging over the market. Friday’s May employment report was being watched closely, but the lower-than-expected job gains reinforced that the Fed could continue to hold off on policy changes for the time being. There were 559,000 jobs added in May, well below the 671,000 expected. Now the CPI report is the next point of focus, ahead of the Fed’s June 15-16 meeting. The question is, will it be so hot that the central bank may have to reassess its view about the temporary nature of inflation, or could it show that price increases are peaking? “There’s inflation out there. You can see it everywhere,” said Massocca. Taper talk The market has been expecting the Fed to begin to talk about unwinding its bond buying later this year, with many strategists targeting the Fed’s Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium at the end of August. The Fed is expected to first discuss cutting back its purchases months ahead of taking action. Then it will slowly reduce its buying. After that, it could consider interest rate hikes, now not expected by the market until 2023. Niles said the meme stock trend has been fueled in part by the Fed. The markets are awash in liquidity as the central bank keeps rates at zero and maintains its monthly purchases of at least $120 billion in Treasury and mortgage securities. “When the Fed backs off of that with tapering, I think that’s when you can go in and say, ‘OK’ we can potentially go after and short some of these highly valued names because that’s when the free money disappears and you actually start to contract some of that free money,” he said. “That’s when things start to get dangerous to the downside.” For now, Niles said he’s staying away from the names that are heavily sought by retail investors or have large short interest and are targeted by Wall Street. “You want to stay away from this stuff now unless you’re doing it in very small size,” he said. There are just a few earnings in the week ahead. One of the handful of names reporting is meme name GameStop on Wednesday. Campbell Soup also reports that day, and Chewy reports Thursday. G-7 finance ministers meet this weekend, and President Joe Biden will attend a meeting of the organization’s leaders in Cornwall, England, on Friday.

May Payrolls Not Too Hot, Not Too Cold Before diving into today’s jobs report for May, it will be a useful exercise to recall the curveball that April’s report threw at investors. One of the more hotly contested topics investors have been debating recently is what to make of the jobs report released one month ago, where the consensus expectation was for 1,000,000 new jobs and we only got 266,000 (since revised up to 278,000). On the one hand, data releases are volatile by nature and it is possible that the large miss could have been broadly dismissed as a “one off” among a package of otherwise very healthy economic data. On the other hand, it did confirm anecdotal evidence of difficult hiring conditions facing companies and reinforced the notion that some workers may be reluctant to return to the workforce for a whole host of reasons. Moreover, if the April report really did unearth new evidence of a weaker-than-expected jobs market in this latter scenario, should we view the effect as temporary or does it have staying power that could spell new trouble for the overall economic recovery? Against this backdrop, investors were hoping that today’s May jobs report would go a long way towards providing some definitive answers to these important questions. It did not. But, that might actually be a good thing. Here are some key takeaways: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ May employment report revealed that the domestic economy added 559,000 jobs in May, slightly below Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ median forecast for a gain of 675,000. The prior two months also received net positive revisions of 27,000 jobs. The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 5.8%, though that was paired with a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate, which moved from 61.7% to 61.6%. Average hourly earnings rose 0.5% month over month, again signaling lower-wage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected. More new lower-wage jobs would be expected to put more downward pressure on wage increases. “It is hard to view 559,000 added jobs as a disappointment, but it does leave something to be desired,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market > Strategist Ryan Detrick. “There is strong potential for job prints in excess of one million over the coming months, but the truth is as strong as the economy is right now, the employment backdrop is clearly lagging what we were all expecting just a few months ago.” As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, May’s jobs number did jump above April’s disappointment, but still came well short of making a fresh new high for 2021. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Where do we go from here? The US economy is still 7.6 million total payrolls shy of its peak prior to the recession, and given the magnitude of that number, we still believe there is the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months. Several catalysts should also lend a helping hand in the near future. Enhanced unemployment benefits may be deterring lower-wage workers from returning to the labor market, as they reduce the relative attractiveness of a paycheck from an employer. In the last month, about half of all states have started eliminating these added benefits in order to reduce the disincentive. We believe this should show up in the data starting with the June employment report. Also, schools might be closing for the summer, but daycare centers are reopening more broadly, freeing parents up to find jobs. Warmer weather, ever-improving vaccination trends, and increasing comfort reengaging in normal activities should all play their parts as well. The labor market will always be inextricably linked to the inflation outlook, this cycle perhaps more than past cycles, and for many that is the real story today.

From a Fed intervention standpoint, today’s employment report likely found a sweet spot, and the early indications are that equity markets are breathing a sigh of relief.

Big First 5 Months Gains Consolidate Over Worst Months S&P 500 is up an impressive 11.9% for the first five months of 2021. That is the 16th best gain for the first five months since 1950. As illustrated in the graph above, gains do beget gains and this bodes well for the year as a whole. But this does not diminish the seasonal pattern of consolidation and mostly sideways market action over the Worst Six Months May-October and even more so over the Worst Four Months July-October. We tabulated the gains for the top 20 first five month gains since 1950 and the gains for the last seven months of the year are still pretty solid averaging 9.4% vs. 14.7% for the top 20 first five months.

Here are some stats to think about regarding S&P 500 performance in June: Since 1950, June is the 4th worst month of the year (September, February, and August are worse). It has been higher the past 5 years in a row, the longest since a stretch of 6 in a row in the late 1990s. The past 10 years, though, June was up 1.0% on average, ranking as the 7th best month. According to Sam Stovall of CFRA, only 5 market declines in excess of 5% started in June versus an average of 8 for all 12 months (since WWII). In other words, it isn’t common for major market weakness to start in June. Building on this, when the S&P 500 is lower in June, it is down by 2.9% on average. This is the second smallest average loss, with only December better at -2.5%. We wouldn’t be surprised at all if stocks took a well-deserved break in June, but this month is rather misunderstood, as a massive sell-off or the start of significant weakness isn’t likely, as that isn’t what June typically brings. Lastly, last Wednesday marked the 100th trading day of the year for the S&P 500. In fact, the S&P 500 was up more than 10% on the 100th day, which historically is a great start to the year, but also has meant continued strong performance the rest of the year is quite normal. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when stocks are up more than 10% on day 100, the rest of the year has been higher 84.2% of the time and up 8.6% on average, both well above what the average year does. We continue to recommend an overweight to equities and underweight to fixed-income position relative to investors’ targets, as appropriate. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Less Than 20% Bearish For the First Time in 115 Weeks Bullish sentiment measured through the AAII weekly survey was at the lowest level since the fall last week, but after jumping 7.7 percentage points, it is now at the highest level since the end of April. Not only is it high relative to the past few weeks, but the increase also brings bullish sentiment 6 percentage points back above its historical average. Additionally, the week over week increase was the largest since the week of April 8th when the reading had risen 11.1 percentage points. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) In recent weeks, neutral sentiment had been surging; topping 37% last week for the highest reading since the first week of 2020. Although it reversed lower this week down to 36.2%, neutral sentiment remains around some of the strongest levels in over a year. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) With the pickup in bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment plummeted to 19.8% on a 6.6 percentage point decile; the largest since February. Falling below 20%, bearish sentiment took out its March and April lows and is now at the lowest level since January 2018. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Not only is that one of the lowest readings in bearish sentiment in recent history, but that drop below 20% brought to an end a 115-week long streak of readings in bearish sentiment above that level. As shown below, that surpassed a three-week shorter streak ending in December 2017 to make for the second-longest such streak on record. The longest streak which ended in December 2010 went on for more than twice as long as this most recent run. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Historically, lower readings in bearish sentiment have tended towards weaker performance for the S&P 500 going forward as shown below. But when it comes to the past times that bearish sentiment has broken below 20% for the first time in at least 50 weeks, performance has actually tended to consistently be positive. In fact, across each of the past six instances, the S&P 500 has been higher six months out every time. Granted, for the most part the typical move higher is usually smaller than other periods.

Typical June Trading: Any Early Gains Tend to Fade Especially After Mid-Month Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-caps. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Main Street Sentiment Strongest in Over a Decade The U.S. economy is opening up and overall sentiment on Main Street is the strongest it’s been since our earliest analysis in 2005, according to LPL Research’s proprietary Beige Book Barometer (BBB). The result is based on our analysis of the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, a publication released two weeks before each Fed policy meeting that captures qualitative observations made by community bankers and business owners—what we like to think of as “Main Street” rather than “Wall Street.” The BBB gauges Main Street’s sentiment by looking at how frequently key words and phrases appear in the text. In the most recent Beige Book, “strong” words were near their highest since we first began tracking data in 2005 while weak words were their lowest on record, resulting in the strongest overall sentiment reading since inception. The strong reading is likely driven more by a change in direction than in overall activity, but even that is a welcome shift. “The country and the economy are going through a disruptive but positive change as most COVID-related restrictions are lifted and the economy reopens,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Sentiment is up and that’s a great sign for the direction of the economy.” (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) This was an important Beige Book in other ways. Mentions of COVID-related words (virus, COVID, pandemic) fell to their lowest level since the March 2020 Beige Book, when the words first started to appear. More concerning, words related to inflation also rose to their highest level since our earliest analysis. The downside of the economy’s rapid acceleration has been a mismatch between demand, which can ramp up quickly, and supply, which comes on line more slowly, while labor markets have also been slow to keep pace with reopening. Overall, the fundamental backdrop for the economy remains positive. Supply chain disruptions can slow the pace of the economic rebound but are likely temporary, while we expect reopening to be enduring. There is still some risk around variants, however, and full supply chain relief will likely need support from accelerated global vaccine distribution. US economic acceleration will probably peak in the second quarter, but there’s still plenty of scope for growth to moderate and still remain above average. Much of the positive news is already priced in for equity markets, which are forward looking, and gains may not come as easily, but we still see solid potential for upside as the economy continues to rebound. S&P 500 Returns Relative to History May has moved back to the rearview mirror and with that, we wanted to provide an update on how current long-term returns for the S&P 500 stack up relative to history. The chart below compares the trailing one, two, five, ten, and twenty-year annualized total returns of the S&P 500 to the S&P 500's historical average returns over those same time periods since 1928. We're starting to move away from the 'easy comps' in terms of market returns relative to the March 2020 lows, but the S&P 500 is still up more than 40% over the last 12 months which is nearly four times the historical average one year return. Over the last two years, the S&P 500's annualized return of 25.8% still comes in at more than twice the historical average of 10.6%. On a five and ten-year basis, the S&P 500's annualized gain also remains comfortably above 10%. All in all, the last decade has been very good for US equity investors. The only time period where the S&P 500 has experienced below-average returns is at the 20-year window where the 8.4% annualized gain clocks in at 2.5 percentage less than the historical average of 10.9%. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) The chart below compares the S&P 500's current returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to all other periods on a percentile basis. With mostly above-average returns, it comes as no surprise that most of the percentile readings rank above the 50th percentile, and for most time periods, the percentile rank comes in well above 50%. The one-year total return of more than 40% actually ranks just above the 93rd percentile, while the two-year return isn't far from the 90th percentile either. Moving further out, each of the other readings going out to ten years are all well above the 50th percentile. The only percentile rank below the 50th percentile is the 20-year window and that reading isn't even close. On the one hand, the last ten years have been phenomenal for equity investors, but the last 20 years haven't even been mediocre. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Throughout history, many investors have always worked under the assumption that long-term returns for the equity market are about 10%. History has shown that to be the case over the last decade at least, as the average annualized one-year gain of the S&P 500 has been well above 10%. With the S&P 500's current 20-year annualized gain currently at just 8.4%, though, what will it take for the S&P 500 to reach double-digit gains on an annualized basis over a 20-year window? For an idea, given the strong performance of the last ten years, a number of commentators suggest that the next ten years for equities will be weak with a reversion to the mean. Only time will tell, but if we operate under the (unlikely) assumption that the S&P 500 stays at the exact same level it is now going forward for the next ten years, its annualized twenty-year return would top 10% for the first time since August 2008 next September. After that brief period above 10% from September 2022 through March 2023, it wouldn't again top that level until February 2029. In spite of the fact that the annualized 20-year return would top 10% in those two periods, though, it still wouldn't get as high as the historical average of 10.9% in either of those periods. This reflects the fact that although the last ten years for US equities have been very strong, they also came shortly after one of the worst ten-year periods for US equities on record.

,"Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 7th, 2021. AMC, meme stocks could spark more heat in the week ahead as investors await inflation news - (Source) Inflation data is a highlight of the week ahead, as investors focus on economic news in the void between earnings season and the next Fed meeting. May’s consumer price index is scheduled to be reported Thursday, and it could be hot after it surged in April. Inflation is viewed as an important trigger that could cause the Federal Reserve to step back from its easy policies, if rising prices appear to be hotter and more persistent than expected. Equities were higher in the past week, but the meme stocks were far hotter. AMC Entertainment gained another 100% and was up 2,700% since January. Energy was the best-performing major sector, gaining more than 6.7% as oil prices jumped nearly 5% in the past week. REITs were the second-best performer, up 3.1%, followed by financials, up 1.2% and technology, also up 1.2%. But it’s the meme stocks that took the headlines, and also contributed to concerns about froth in the stock market. “People think this is new. It completely isn’t,” Dan Niles, founder of Satori Fund, said of the trading frenzy. He noted there was similar froth in individual stocks in 1999, when companies added dot-com to their names to attract investor attention. “What’s new is the fact that these traders are armed with stimulus checks. They can organize more easily on things like WallStreetBets, they can work from home, and there’s no-cost trading. Those are the differences,” Niles said on CNBC. “So, if it gets people interested in investing, that’s great. What I don’t like is when you have people sort of taking out mortgages on their home, and putting themselves at risk if the thing collapsed,” he added. “You want to be able to invest what you can afford to lose if you’re going to play in something like this.” Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities, said the trading in names like GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond is one of the things that has made him more cautious about the market. He said the high valuations on the meme names are unlikely to last. “It’s going to be around as long as cicadas are,” he said. The S&P 500 in the past week gained 0.6%, rising to 4,229, just 9 points from its all-time high. The Dow was up 0.7% to 34,756, and the Nasdaq gained 0.5% to 13,814. Watching the inflation signs Massocca said investors should stay focused on things like inflation, since that could be what makes the Federal Reserve reverse its easy policy. The Fed has so far said it sees the higher inflation readings as transitory. Economists expect CPI to be up 4.7% year over year, after April’s 4.2% pace, according to Dow Jones. Core inflation is expected to be up 0.4% for the month and 3.4% year over year. “I’m getting nervous. I’m seeing signs of a top. I’m systematically raising cash. I think the market looks too expensive,” Massocca said. “We’re going to shake off the dust from Covid. The economy is going to be very, very good and as a rule, I think monetary policy is going to respond to some degree.” He said the memes mania is just one sign, but the spark for a sell-off could be anything including a hawkish comment from the Fed. “Who knows what it is, but the kindling is building and as soon as a match hits it, the market is setting up for a 7% to 10% pullback at some point,” he said. “Who knows what starts it. ... One of the candidates very likely will be some kind of reductions in monetary policy.” Fear of the Fed stepping back from its easy policy has been hanging over the market. Friday’s May employment report was being watched closely, but the lower-than-expected job gains reinforced that the Fed could continue to hold off on policy changes for the time being. There were 559,000 jobs added in May, well below the 671,000 expected. Now the CPI report is the next point of focus, ahead of the Fed’s June 15-16 meeting. The question is, will it be so hot that the central bank may have to reassess its view about the temporary nature of inflation, or could it show that price increases are peaking? “There’s inflation out there. You can see it everywhere,” said Massocca. Taper talk The market has been expecting the Fed to begin to talk about unwinding its bond buying later this year, with many strategists targeting the Fed’s Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium at the end of August. The Fed is expected to first discuss cutting back its purchases months ahead of taking action. Then it will slowly reduce its buying. After that, it could consider interest rate hikes, now not expected by the market until 2023. Niles said the meme stock trend has been fueled in part by the Fed. The markets are awash in liquidity as the central bank keeps rates at zero and maintains its monthly purchases of at least $120 billion in Treasury and mortgage securities. “When the Fed backs off of that with tapering, I think that’s when you can go in and say, ‘OK’ we can potentially go after and short some of these highly valued names because that’s when the free money disappears and you actually start to contract some of that free money,” he said. “That’s when things start to get dangerous to the downside.” For now, Niles said he’s staying away from the names that are heavily sought by retail investors or have large short interest and are targeted by Wall Street. “You want to stay away from this stuff now unless you’re doing it in very small size,” he said. There are just a few earnings in the week ahead. One of the handful of names reporting is meme name GameStop on Wednesday. Campbell Soup also reports that day, and Chewy reports Thursday. G-7 finance ministers meet this weekend, and President Joe Biden will attend a meeting of the organization’s leaders in Cornwall, England, on Friday.

May Payrolls Not Too Hot, Not Too Cold Before diving into today’s jobs report for May, it will be a useful exercise to recall the curveball that April’s report threw at investors. One of the more hotly contested topics investors have been debating recently is what to make of the jobs report released one month ago, where the consensus expectation was for 1,000,000 new jobs and we only got 266,000 (since revised up to 278,000). On the one hand, data releases are volatile by nature and it is possible that the large miss could have been broadly dismissed as a “one off” among a package of otherwise very healthy economic data. On the other hand, it did confirm anecdotal evidence of difficult hiring conditions facing companies and reinforced the notion that some workers may be reluctant to return to the workforce for a whole host of reasons. Moreover, if the April report really did unearth new evidence of a weaker-than-expected jobs market in this latter scenario, should we view the effect as temporary or does it have staying power that could spell new trouble for the overall economic recovery? Against this backdrop, investors were hoping that today’s May jobs report would go a long way towards providing some definitive answers to these important questions. It did not. But, that might actually be a good thing. Here are some key takeaways: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ May employment report revealed that the domestic economy added 559,000 jobs in May, slightly below Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ median forecast for a gain of 675,000. The prior two months also received net positive revisions of 27,000 jobs. The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 5.8%, though that was paired with a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate, which moved from 61.7% to 61.6%. Average hourly earnings rose 0.5% month over month, again signaling lower-wage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected. More new lower-wage jobs would be expected to put more downward pressure on wage increases. “It is hard to view 559,000 added jobs as a disappointment, but it does leave something to be desired,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market > Strategist Ryan Detrick. “There is strong potential for job prints in excess of one million over the coming months, but the truth is as strong as the economy is right now, the employment backdrop is clearly lagging what we were all expecting just a few months ago.” As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, May’s jobs number did jump above April’s disappointment, but still came well short of making a fresh new high for 2021. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Where do we go from here? The US economy is still 7.6 million total payrolls shy of its peak prior to the recession, and given the magnitude of that number, we still believe there is the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months. Several catalysts should also lend a helping hand in the near future. Enhanced unemployment benefits may be deterring lower-wage workers from returning to the labor market, as they reduce the relative attractiveness of a paycheck from an employer. In the last month, about half of all states have started eliminating these added benefits in order to reduce the disincentive. We believe this should show up in the data starting with the June employment report. Also, schools might be closing for the summer, but daycare centers are reopening more broadly, freeing parents up to find jobs. Warmer weather, ever-improving vaccination trends, and increasing comfort reengaging in normal activities should all play their parts as well. The labor market will always be inextricably linked to the inflation outlook, this cycle perhaps more than past cycles, and for many that is the real story today. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has made it clear it will tolerate near-term inflation overshoots in order to achieve “substantial further progress” towards its employment goals before it begins taking measures to combat higher inflation. Recent hotter-than-expected inflation reports have increasingly turned the spotlight towards the Fed’s timeline for reducing their asset purchases, which, given their stated position, will depend on strong payroll reports. As such, we find ourselves (to a degree) in a “good news is bad news” scenario, as strong labor market readings could hasten the Fed’s timetable to begin normalizing monetary policy. Today’s report likely did little to convince the Fed that the labor market is closer to meeting its “substantial further progress” goal on employment, and therefore, all else equal, will not compel them to consider reducing asset purchases sooner rather than later. There is much ground still to be made up in the labor market, and we believe the Fed will need to see a string of strong reports, likely in the one million range, before it begins to take action. From a Fed intervention standpoint, today’s employment report likely found a sweet spot, and the early indications are that equity markets are breathing a sigh of relief. For a deeper dive into the inflation picture, check the blog on Thursday, June 10, when data for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation is set to be released. Big First 5 Months Gains Consolidate Over Worst Months S&P 500 is up an impressive 11.9% for the first five months of 2021. That is the 16th best gain for the first five months since 1950. As illustrated in the graph above, gains do beget gains and this bodes well for the year as a whole. But this does not diminish the seasonal pattern of consolidation and mostly sideways market action over the Worst Six Months May-October and even more so over the Worst Four Months July-October. We tabulated the gains for the top 20 first five month gains since 1950 and the gains for the last seven months of the year are still pretty solid averaging 9.4% vs. 14.7% for the top 20 first five months. But the bulk of those gains as you can see in the graph come from late-October to yearend. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) June Swoon? Although there was some notable weakness in the middle of May, the S&P 500 Index was able to rally late in the month to finish with a modest gain. Incredibly, this was the eighth year out of the past nine that stocks gained during in May. Who said Sell in May? (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) As we noted a month ago, the worst six months of the year indeed are May through October, so we are still in the thick of a potentially challenging period based on seasonality. “After a nearly 90% rally off the lows, stocks could be ripe for a pullback, especially during the historically weak month of June,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But with the improving economy, coupled with historic fiscal and monetary stimulus, we expect any weakness to be short-lived.” (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Here are some stats to think about regarding S&P 500 performance in June: Since 1950, June is the 4th worst month of the year (September, February, and August are worse). It has been higher the past 5 years in a row, the longest since a stretch of 6 in a row in the late 1990s. The past 10 years, though, June was up 1.0% on average, ranking as the 7th best month. According to Sam Stovall of CFRA, only 5 market declines in excess of 5% started in June versus an average of 8 for all 12 months (since WWII). In other words, it isn’t common for major market weakness to start in June. Building on this, when the S&P 500 is lower in June, it is down by 2.9% on average. This is the second smallest average loss, with only December better at -2.5%. We wouldn’t be surprised at all if stocks took a well-deserved break in June, but this month is rather misunderstood, as a massive sell-off or the start of significant weakness isn’t likely, as that isn’t what June typically brings. Lastly, last Wednesday marked the 100th trading day of the year for the S&P 500. In fact, the S&P 500 was up more than 10% on the 100th day, which historically is a great start to the year, but also has meant continued strong performance the rest of the year is quite normal. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when stocks are up more than 10% on day 100, the rest of the year has been higher 84.2% of the time and up 8.6% on average, both well above what the average year does. We continue to recommend an overweight to equities and underweight to fixed-income position relative to investors’ targets, as appropriate. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Less Than 20% Bearish For the First Time in 115 Weeks Bullish sentiment measured through the AAII weekly survey was at the lowest level since the fall last week, but after jumping 7.7 percentage points, it is now at the highest level since the end of April. Not only is it high relative to the past few weeks, but the increase also brings bullish sentiment 6 percentage points back above its historical average. Additionally, the week over week increase was the largest since the week of April 8th when the reading had risen 11.1 percentage points. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) In recent weeks, neutral sentiment had been surging; topping 37% last week for the highest reading since the first week of 2020. Although it reversed lower this week down to 36.2%, neutral sentiment remains around some of the strongest levels in over a year. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) With the pickup in bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment plummeted to 19.8% on a 6.6 percentage point decile; the largest since February. Falling below 20%, bearish sentiment took out its March and April lows and is now at the lowest level since January 2018. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Not only is that one of the lowest readings in bearish sentiment in recent history, but that drop below 20% brought to an end a 115-week long streak of readings in bearish sentiment above that level. As shown below, that surpassed a three-week shorter streak ending in December 2017 to make for the second-longest such streak on record. The longest streak which ended in December 2010 went on for more than twice as long as this most recent run. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Historically, lower readings in bearish sentiment have tended towards weaker performance for the S&P 500 going forward as shown below. But when it comes to the past times that bearish sentiment has broken below 20% for the first time in at least 50 weeks, performance has actually tended to consistently be positive. In fact, across each of the past six instances, the S&P 500 has been higher six months out every time. Granted, for the most part the typical move higher is usually smaller than other periods.

S&P 500 Returns Relative to History May has moved back to the rearview mirror and with that, we wanted to provide an update on how current long-term returns for the S&P 500 stack up relative to history. The chart below compares the trailing one, two, five, ten, and twenty-year annualized total returns of the S&P 500 to the S&P 500's historical average returns over those same time periods since 1928. We're starting to move away from the 'easy comps' in terms of market returns relative to the March 2020 lows, but the S&P 500 is still up more than 40% over the last 12 months which is nearly four times the historical average one year return. Over the last two years, the S&P 500's annualized return of 25.8% still comes in at more than twice the historical average of 10.6%. On a five and ten-year basis, the S&P 500's annualized gain also remains comfortably above 10%. All in all, the last decade has been very good for US equity investors. The only time period where the S&P 500 has experienced below-average returns is at the 20-year window where the 8.4% annualized gain clocks in at 2.5 percentage less than the historical average of 10.9%. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) The chart below compares the S&P 500's current returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to all other periods on a percentile basis. With mostly above-average returns, it comes as no surprise that most of the percentile readings rank above the 50th percentile, and for most time periods, the percentile rank comes in well above 50%. The one-year total return of more than 40% actually ranks just above the 93rd percentile, while the two-year return isn't far from the 90th percentile either. Moving further out, each of the other readings going out to ten years are all well above the 50th percentile. The only percentile rank below the 50th percentile is the 20-year window and that reading isn't even close. On the one hand, the last ten years have been phenomenal for equity investors, but the last 20 years haven't even been mediocre. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Throughout history, many investors have always worked under the assumption that long-term returns for the equity market are about 10%. History has shown that to be the case over the last decade at least, as the average annualized one-year gain of the S&P 500 has been well above 10%. With the S&P 500's current 20-year annualized gain currently at just 8.4%, though, what will it take for the S&P 500 to reach double-digit gains on an annualized basis over a 20-year window? For an idea, given the strong performance of the last ten years, a number of commentators suggest that the next ten years for equities will be weak with a reversion to the mean. Only time will tell, but if we operate under the (unlikely) assumption that the S&P 500 stays at the exact same level it is now going forward for the next ten years, its annualized twenty-year return would top 10% for the first time since August 2008 next September. After that brief period above 10% from September 2022 through March 2023, it wouldn't again top that level until February 2029. In spite of the fact that the annualized 20-year return would top 10% in those two periods, though, it still wouldn't get as high as the historical average of 10.9% in either of those periods. This reflects the fact that although the last ten years for US equities have been very strong, they also came shortly after one of the worst ten-year periods for US equities on record.

,"Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 7th, 2021. AMC, meme stocks could spark more heat in the week ahead as investors await inflation news - (Source) Inflation data is a highlight of the week ahead, as investors focus on economic news in the void between earnings season and the next Fed meeting. May’s consumer price index is scheduled to be reported Thursday, and it could be hot after it surged in April. Inflation is viewed as an important trigger that could cause the Federal Reserve to step back from its easy policies, if rising prices appear to be hotter and more persistent than expected. Equities were higher in the past week, but the meme stocks were far hotter. AMC Entertainment gained another 100% and was up 2,700% since January. Energy was the best-performing major sector, gaining more than 6.7% as oil prices jumped nearly 5% in the past week. REITs were the second-best performer, up 3.1%, followed by financials, up 1.2% and technology, also up 1.2%. But it’s the meme stocks that took the headlines, and also contributed to concerns about froth in the stock market. “People think this is new. It completely isn’t,” Dan Niles, founder of Satori Fund, said of the trading frenzy. He noted there was similar froth in individual stocks in 1999, when companies added dot-com to their names to attract investor attention. “What’s new is the fact that these traders are armed with stimulus checks. They can organize more easily on things like WallStreetBets, they can work from home, and there’s no-cost trading. Those are the differences,” Niles said on CNBC. “So, if it gets people interested in investing, that’s great. What I don’t like is when you have people sort of taking out mortgages on their home, and putting themselves at risk if the thing collapsed,” he added. “You want to be able to invest what you can afford to lose if you’re going to play in something like this.” Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities, said the trading in names like GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond is one of the things that has made him more cautious about the market. He said the high valuations on the meme names are unlikely to last. “It’s going to be around as long as cicadas are,” he said. The S&P 500 in the past week gained 0.6%, rising to 4,229, just 9 points from its all-time high. The Dow was up 0.7% to 34,756, and the Nasdaq gained 0.5% to 13,814. Watching the inflation signs Massocca said investors should stay focused on things like inflation, since that could be what makes the Federal Reserve reverse its easy policy. The Fed has so far said it sees the higher inflation readings as transitory. Economists expect CPI to be up 4.7% year over year, after April’s 4.2% pace, according to Dow Jones. Core inflation is expected to be up 0.4% for the month and 3.4% year over year. “I’m getting nervous. I’m seeing signs of a top. I’m systematically raising cash. I think the market looks too expensive,” Massocca said. “We’re going to shake off the dust from Covid. The economy is going to be very, very good and as a rule, I think monetary policy is going to respond to some degree.” He said the memes mania is just one sign, but the spark for a sell-off could be anything including a hawkish comment from the Fed. “Who knows what it is, but the kindling is building and as soon as a match hits it, the market is setting up for a 7% to 10% pullback at some point,” he said. “Who knows what starts it. ... One of the candidates very likely will be some kind of reductions in monetary policy.” Fear of the Fed stepping back from its easy policy has been hanging over the market. Friday’s May employment report was being watched closely, but the lower-than-expected job gains reinforced that the Fed could continue to hold off on policy changes for the time being. There were 559,000 jobs added in May, well below the 671,000 expected. Now the CPI report is the next point of focus, ahead of the Fed’s June 15-16 meeting. The question is, will it be so hot that the central bank may have to reassess its view about the temporary nature of inflation, or could it show that price increases are peaking? “There’s inflation out there. You can see it everywhere,” said Massocca. Taper talk The market has been expecting the Fed to begin to talk about unwinding its bond buying later this year, with many strategists targeting the Fed’s Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium at the end of August. The Fed is expected to first discuss cutting back its purchases months ahead of taking action. Then it will slowly reduce its buying. After that, it could consider interest rate hikes, now not expected by the market until 2023. Niles said the meme stock trend has been fueled in part by the Fed. The markets are awash in liquidity as the central bank keeps rates at zero and maintains its monthly purchases of at least $120 billion in Treasury and mortgage securities. “When the Fed backs off of that with tapering, I think that’s when you can go in and say, ‘OK’ we can potentially go after and short some of these highly valued names because that’s when the free money disappears and you actually start to contract some of that free money,” he said. “That’s when things start to get dangerous to the downside.” For now, Niles said he’s staying away from the names that are heavily sought by retail investors or have large short interest and are targeted by Wall Street. “You want to stay away from this stuff now unless you’re doing it in very small size,” he said. There are just a few earnings in the week ahead. One of the handful of names reporting is meme name GameStop on Wednesday. Campbell Soup also reports that day, and Chewy reports Thursday. G-7 finance ministers meet this weekend, and President Joe Biden will attend a meeting of the organization’s leaders in Cornwall, England, on Friday.

May Payrolls Not Too Hot, Not Too Cold Before diving into today’s jobs report for May, it will be a useful exercise to recall the curveball that April’s report threw at investors. One of the more hotly contested topics investors have been debating recently is what to make of the jobs report released one month ago, where the consensus expectation was for 1,000,000 new jobs and we only got 266,000 (since revised up to 278,000). On the one hand, data releases are volatile by nature and it is possible that the large miss could have been broadly dismissed as a “one off” among a package of otherwise very healthy economic data. On the other hand, it did confirm anecdotal evidence of difficult hiring conditions facing companies and reinforced the notion that some workers may be reluctant to return to the workforce for a whole host of reasons. Moreover, if the April report really did unearth new evidence of a weaker-than-expected jobs market in this latter scenario, should we view the effect as temporary or does it have staying power that could spell new trouble for the overall economic recovery? Against this backdrop, investors were hoping that today’s May jobs report would go a long way towards providing some definitive answers to these important questions. It did not. But, that might actually be a good thing. Here are some key takeaways: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ May employment report revealed that the domestic economy added 559,000 jobs in May, slightly below Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ median forecast for a gain of 675,000. The prior two months also received net positive revisions of 27,000 jobs. The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 5.8%, though that was paired with a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate, which moved from 61.7% to 61.6%. Average hourly earnings rose 0.5% month over month, again signaling lower-wage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected. More new lower-wage jobs would be expected to put more downward pressure on wage increases. “It is hard to view 559,000 added jobs as a disappointment, but it does leave something to be desired,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market > Strategist Ryan Detrick. “There is strong potential for job prints in excess of one million over the coming months, but the truth is as strong as the economy is right now, the employment backdrop is clearly lagging what we were all expecting just a few months ago.” As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, May’s jobs number did jump above April’s disappointment, but still came well short of making a fresh new high for 2021. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Where do we go from here? The US economy is still 7.6 million total payrolls shy of its peak prior to the recession, and given the magnitude of that number, we still believe there is the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months. Several catalysts should also lend a helping hand in the near future. Enhanced unemployment benefits may be deterring lower-wage workers from returning to the labor market, as they reduce the relative attractiveness of a paycheck from an employer. In the last month, about half of all states have started eliminating these added benefits in order to reduce the disincentive. We believe this should show up in the data starting with the June employment report. Also, schools might be closing for the summer, but daycare centers are reopening more broadly, freeing parents up to find jobs. Warmer weather, ever-improving vaccination trends, and increasing comfort reengaging in normal activities should all play their parts as well. The labor market will always be inextricably linked to the inflation outlook, this cycle perhaps more than past cycles, and for many that is the real story today. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has made it clear it will tolerate near-term inflation overshoots in order to achieve “substantial further progress” towards its employment goals before it begins taking measures to combat higher inflation. Recent hotter-than-expected inflation reports have increasingly turned the spotlight towards the Fed’s timeline for reducing their asset purchases, which, given their stated position, will depend on strong payroll reports. As such, we find ourselves (to a degree) in a “good news is bad news” scenario, as strong labor market readings could hasten the Fed’s timetable to begin normalizing monetary policy. Today’s report likely did little to convince the Fed that the labor market is closer to meeting its “substantial further progress” goal on employment, and therefore, all else equal, will not compel them to consider reducing asset purchases sooner rather than later. There is much ground still to be made up in the labor market, and we believe the Fed will need to see a string of strong reports, likely in the one million range, before it begins to take action. From a Fed intervention standpoint, today’s employment report likely found a sweet spot, and the early indications are that equity markets are breathing a sigh of relief. For a deeper dive into the inflation picture, check the blog on Thursday, June 10, when data for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation is set to be released. Big First 5 Months Gains Consolidate Over Worst Months S&P 500 is up an impressive 11.9% for the first five months of 2021. That is the 16th best gain for the first five months since 1950. As illustrated in the graph above, gains do beget gains and this bodes well for the year as a whole. But this does not diminish the seasonal pattern of consolidation and mostly sideways market action over the Worst Six Months May-October and even more so over the Worst Four Months July-October. We tabulated the gains for the top 20 first five month gains since 1950 and the gains for the last seven months of the year are still pretty solid averaging 9.4% vs. 14.7% for the top 20 first five months. But the bulk of those gains as you can see in the graph come from late-October to yearend. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) June Swoon? Although there was some notable weakness in the middle of May, the S&P 500 Index was able to rally late in the month to finish with a modest gain. Incredibly, this was the eighth year out of the past nine that stocks gained during in May. Who said Sell in May? (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) As we noted a month ago, the worst six months of the year indeed are May through October, so we are still in the thick of a potentially challenging period based on seasonality. “After a nearly 90% rally off the lows, stocks could be ripe for a pullback, especially during the historically weak month of June,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But with the improving economy, coupled with historic fiscal and monetary stimulus, we expect any weakness to be short-lived.” (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Here are some stats to think about regarding S&P 500 performance in June: Since 1950, June is the 4th worst month of the year (September, February, and August are worse). It has been higher the past 5 years in a row, the longest since a stretch of 6 in a row in the late 1990s. The past 10 years, though, June was up 1.0% on average, ranking as the 7th best month. According to Sam Stovall of CFRA, only 5 market declines in excess of 5% started in June versus an average of 8 for all 12 months (since WWII). In other words, it isn’t common for major market weakness to start in June. Building on this, when the S&P 500 is lower in June, it is down by 2.9% on average. This is the second smallest average loss, with only December better at -2.5%. We wouldn’t be surprised at all if stocks took a well-deserved break in June, but this month is rather misunderstood, as a massive sell-off or the start of significant weakness isn’t likely, as that isn’t what June typically brings. Lastly, last Wednesday marked the 100th trading day of the year for the S&P 500. In fact, the S&P 500 was up more than 10% on the 100th day, which historically is a great start to the year, but also has meant continued strong performance the rest of the year is quite normal. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when stocks are up more than 10% on day 100, the rest of the year has been higher 84.2% of the time and up 8.6% on average, both well above what the average year does. We continue to recommend an overweight to equities and underweight to fixed-income position relative to investors’ targets, as appropriate. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Less Than 20% Bearish For the First Time in 115 Weeks Bullish sentiment measured through the AAII weekly survey was at the lowest level since the fall last week, but after jumping 7.7 percentage points, it is now at the highest level since the end of April. Not only is it high relative to the past few weeks, but the increase also brings bullish sentiment 6 percentage points back above its historical average. Additionally, the week over week increase was the largest since the week of April 8th when the reading had risen 11.1 percentage points. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) In recent weeks, neutral sentiment had been surging; topping 37% last week for the highest reading since the first week of 2020. Although it reversed lower this week down to 36.2%, neutral sentiment remains around some of the strongest levels in over a year. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) With the pickup in bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment plummeted to 19.8% on a 6.6 percentage point decile; the largest since February. Falling below 20%, bearish sentiment took out its March and April lows and is now at the lowest level since January 2018. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Not only is that one of the lowest readings in bearish sentiment in recent history, but that drop below 20% brought to an end a 115-week long streak of readings in bearish sentiment above that level. As shown below, that surpassed a three-week shorter streak ending in December 2017 to make for the second-longest such streak on record. The longest streak which ended in December 2010 went on for more than twice as long as this most recent run. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Historically, lower readings in bearish sentiment have tended towards weaker performance for the S&P 500 going forward as shown below. But when it comes to the past times that bearish sentiment has broken below 20% for the first time in at least 50 weeks, performance has actually tended to consistently be positive. In fact, across each of the past six instances, the S&P 500 has been higher six months out every time. Granted, for the most part the typical move higher is usually smaller than other periods. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Typical June Trading: Any Early Gains Tend to Fade Especially After Mid-Month Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-caps. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Main Street Sentiment Strongest in Over a Decade The U.S. economy is opening up and overall sentiment on Main Street is the strongest it’s been since our earliest analysis in 2005, according to LPL Research’s proprietary Beige Book Barometer (BBB). The result is based on our analysis of the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, a publication released two weeks before each Fed policy meeting that captures qualitative observations made by community bankers and business owners—what we like to think of as “Main Street” rather than “Wall Street.” The BBB gauges Main Street’s sentiment by looking at how frequently key words and phrases appear in the text. In the most recent Beige Book, “strong” words were near their highest since we first began tracking data in 2005 while weak words were their lowest on record, resulting in the strongest overall sentiment reading since inception. The strong reading is likely driven more by a change in direction than in overall activity, but even that is a welcome shift. “The country and the economy are going through a disruptive but positive change as most COVID-related restrictions are lifted and the economy reopens,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Sentiment is up and that’s a great sign for the direction of the economy.” (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) This was an important Beige Book in other ways. Mentions of COVID-related words (virus, COVID, pandemic) fell to their lowest level since the March 2020 Beige Book, when the words first started to appear. More concerning, words related to inflation also rose to their highest level since our earliest analysis. The downside of the economy’s rapid acceleration has been a mismatch between demand, which can ramp up quickly, and supply, which comes on line more slowly, while labor markets have also been slow to keep pace with reopening. Overall, the fundamental backdrop for the economy remains positive. Supply chain disruptions can slow the pace of the economic rebound but are likely temporary, while we expect reopening to be enduring. There is still some risk around variants, however, and full supply chain relief will likely need support from accelerated global vaccine distribution. US economic acceleration will probably peak in the second quarter, but there’s still plenty of scope for growth to moderate and still remain above average. Much of the positive news is already priced in for equity markets, which are forward looking, and gains may not come as easily, but we still see solid potential for upside as the economy continues to rebound. S&P 500 Returns Relative to History May has moved back to the rearview mirror and with that, we wanted to provide an update on how current long-term returns for the S&P 500 stack up relative to history. The chart below compares the trailing one, two, five, ten, and twenty-year annualized total returns of the S&P 500 to the S&P 500's historical average returns over those same time periods since 1928. We're starting to move away from the 'easy comps' in terms of market returns relative to the March 2020 lows, but the S&P 500 is still up more than 40% over the last 12 months which is nearly four times the historical average one year return. Over the last two years, the S&P 500's annualized return of 25.8% still comes in at more than twice the historical average of 10.6%. On a five and ten-year basis, the S&P 500's annualized gain also remains comfortably above 10%. All in all, the last decade has been very good for US equity investors. The only time period where the S&P 500 has experienced below-average returns is at the 20-year window where the 8.4% annualized gain clocks in at 2.5 percentage less than the historical average of 10.9%. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) The chart below compares the S&P 500's current returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to all other periods on a percentile basis. With mostly above-average returns, it comes as no surprise that most of the percentile readings rank above the 50th percentile, and for most time periods, the percentile rank comes in well above 50%. The one-year total return of more than 40% actually ranks just above the 93rd percentile, while the two-year return isn't far from the 90th percentile either. Moving further out, each of the other readings going out to ten years are all well above the 50th percentile. The only percentile rank below the 50th percentile is the 20-year window and that reading isn't even close. On the one hand, the last ten years have been phenomenal for equity investors, but the last 20 years haven't even been mediocre. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Throughout history, many investors have always worked under the assumption that long-term returns for the equity market are about 10%. History has shown that to be the case over the last decade at least, as the average annualized one-year gain of the S&P 500 has been well above 10%. With the S&P 500's current 20-year annualized gain currently at just 8.4%, though, what will it take for the S&P 500 to reach double-digit gains on an annualized basis over a 20-year window? For an idea, given the strong performance of the last ten years, a number of commentators suggest that the next ten years for equities will be weak with a reversion to the mean. Only time will tell, but if we operate under the (unlikely) assumption that the S&P 500 stays at the exact same level it is now going forward for the next ten years, its annualized twenty-year return would top 10% for the first time since August 2008 next September. After that brief period above 10% from September 2022 through March 2023, it wouldn't again top that level until February 2029. In spite of the fact that the annualized 20-year return would top 10% in those two periods, though, it still wouldn't get as high as the historical average of 10.9% in either of those periods. This reflects the fact that although the last ten years for US equities have been very strong, they also came shortly after one of the worst ten-year periods for US equities on record.

AMC, meme stocks could spark more heat in the week ahead as investors await inflation news - (Source) Inflation data is a highlight of the week ahead, as investors focus on economic news in the void between earnings season and the next Fed meeting. May’s consumer price index is scheduled to be reported Thursday, and it could be hot after it surged in April. Inflation is viewed as an important trigger that could cause the Federal Reserve to step back from its easy policies, if rising prices appear to be hotter and more persistent than expected. Equities were higher in the past week, but the meme stocks were far hotter. AMC Entertainment gained another 100% and was up 2,700% since January. Energy was the best-performing major sector, gaining more than 6.7% as oil prices jumped nearly 5% in the past week. REITs were the second-best performer, up 3.1%, followed by financials, up 1.2% and technology, also up 1.2%. But it’s the meme stocks that took the headlines, and also contributed to concerns about froth in the stock market. “People think this is new. It completely isn’t,” Dan Niles, founder of Satori Fund, said of the trading frenzy. He noted there was similar froth in individual stocks in 1999, when companies added dot-com to their names to attract investor attention. “What’s new is the fact that these traders are armed with stimulus checks. They can organize more easily on things like WallStreetBets, they can work from home, and there’s no-cost trading. Those are the differences,” Niles said on CNBC. “So, if it gets people interested in investing, that’s great. What I don’t like is when you have people sort of taking out mortgages on their home, and putting themselves at risk if the thing collapsed,” he added. “You want to be able to invest what you can afford to lose if you’re going to play in something like this.” Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities, said the trading in names like GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond is one of the things that has made him more cautious about the market. He said the high valuations on the meme names are unlikely to last. “It’s going to be around as long as cicadas are,” he said. The S&P 500 in the past week gained 0.6%, rising to 4,229, just 9 points from its all-time high. The Dow was up 0.7% to 34,756, and the Nasdaq gained 0.5% to 13,814. Watching the inflation signs Massocca said investors should stay focused on things like inflation, since that could be what makes the Federal Reserve reverse its easy policy. The Fed has so far said it sees the higher inflation readings as transitory. Economists expect CPI to be up 4.7% year over year, after April’s 4.2% pace, according to Dow Jones. Core inflation is expected to be up 0.4% for the month and 3.4% year over year. “I’m getting nervous. I’m seeing signs of a top. I’m systematically raising cash. I think the market looks too expensive,” Massocca said. “We’re going to shake off the dust from Covid. The economy is going to be very, very good and as a rule, I think monetary policy is going to respond to some degree.” He said the memes mania is just one sign, but the spark for a sell-off could be anything including a hawkish comment from the Fed. “Who knows what it is, but the kindling is building and as soon as a match hits it, the market is setting up for a 7% to 10% pullback at some point,” he said. “Who knows what starts it. ... One of the candidates very likely will be some kind of reductions in monetary policy.” Fear of the Fed stepping back from its easy policy has been hanging over the market. Friday’s May employment report was being watched closely, but the lower-than-expected job gains reinforced that the Fed could continue to hold off on policy changes for the time being. There were 559,000 jobs added in May, well below the 671,000 expected. Now the CPI report is the next point of focus, ahead of the Fed’s June 15-16 meeting. The question is, will it be so hot that the central bank may have to reassess its view about the temporary nature of inflation, or could it show that price increases are peaking? “There’s inflation out there. You can see it everywhere,” said Massocca. Taper talk The market has been expecting the Fed to begin to talk about unwinding its bond buying later this year, with many strategists targeting the Fed’s Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium at the end of August. The Fed is expected to first discuss cutting back its purchases months ahead of taking action. Then it will slowly reduce its buying. After that, it could consider interest rate hikes, now not expected by the market until 2023. Niles said the meme stock trend has been fueled in part by the Fed. The markets are awash in liquidity as the central bank keeps rates at zero and maintains its monthly purchases of at least $120 billion in Treasury and mortgage securities. “When the Fed backs off of that with tapering, I think that’s when you can go in and say, ‘OK’ we can potentially go after and short some of these highly valued names because that’s when the free money disappears and you actually start to contract some of that free money,” he said. “That’s when things start to get dangerous to the downside.” For now, Niles said he’s staying away from the names that are heavily sought by retail investors or have large short interest and are targeted by Wall Street. “You want to stay away from this stuff now unless you’re doing it in very small size,” he said. There are just a few earnings in the week ahead. One of the handful of names reporting is meme name GameStop on Wednesday. Campbell Soup also reports that day, and Chewy reports Thursday. G-7 finance ministers meet this weekend, and President Joe Biden will attend a meeting of the organization’s leaders in Cornwall, England, on Friday.

May Payrolls Not Too Hot, Not Too Cold Before diving into today’s jobs report for May, it will be a useful exercise to recall the curveball that April’s report threw at investors. One of the more hotly contested topics investors have been debating recently is what to make of the jobs report released one month ago, where the consensus expectation was for 1,000,000 new jobs and we only got 266,000 (since revised up to 278,000). On the one hand, data releases are volatile by nature and it is possible that the large miss could have been broadly dismissed as a “one off” among a package of otherwise very healthy economic data. On the other hand, it did confirm anecdotal evidence of difficult hiring conditions facing companies and reinforced the notion that some workers may be reluctant to return to the workforce for a whole host of reasons. Moreover, if the April report really did unearth new evidence of a weaker-than-expected jobs market in this latter scenario, should we view the effect as temporary or does it have staying power that could spell new trouble for the overall economic recovery? Against this backdrop, investors were hoping that today’s May jobs report would go a long way towards providing some definitive answers to these important questions. It did not. But, that might actually be a good thing. Here are some key takeaways: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ May employment report revealed that the domestic economy added 559,000 jobs in May, slightly below Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ median forecast for a gain of 675,000. The prior two months also received net positive revisions of 27,000 jobs. The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 5.8%, though that was paired with a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate, which moved from 61.7% to 61.6%. Average hourly earnings rose 0.5% month over month, again signaling lower-wage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected. More new lower-wage jobs would be expected to put more downward pressure on wage increases. “It is hard to view 559,000 added jobs as a disappointment, but it does leave something to be desired,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market > Strategist Ryan Detrick. “There is strong potential for job prints in excess of one million over the coming months, but the truth is as strong as the economy is right now, the employment backdrop is clearly lagging what we were all expecting just a few months ago.” As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, May’s jobs number did jump above April’s disappointment, but still came well short of making a fresh new high for 2021. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Where do we go from here? The US economy is still 7.6 million total payrolls shy of its peak prior to the recession, and given the magnitude of that number, we still believe there is the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months. Several catalysts should also lend a helping hand in the near future. Enhanced unemployment benefits may be deterring lower-wage workers from returning to the labor market, as they reduce the relative attractiveness of a paycheck from an employer. In the last month, about half of all states have started eliminating these added benefits in order to reduce the disincentive. We believe this should show up in the data starting with the June employment report. Also, schools might be closing for the summer, but daycare centers are reopening more broadly, freeing parents up to find jobs. Warmer weather, ever-improving vaccination trends, and increasing comfort reengaging in normal activities should all play their parts as well. The labor market will always be inextricably linked to the inflation outlook, this cycle perhaps more than past cycles, and for many that is the real story today. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has made it clear it will tolerate near-term inflation overshoots in order to achieve “substantial further progress” towards its employment goals before it begins taking measures to combat higher inflation. Recent hotter-than-expected inflation reports have increasingly turned the spotlight towards the Fed’s timeline for reducing their asset purchases, which, given their stated position, will depend on strong payroll reports. As such, we find ourselves (to a degree) in a “good news is bad news” scenario, as strong labor market readings could hasten the Fed’s timetable to begin normalizing monetary policy. Today’s report likely did little to convince the Fed that the labor market is closer to meeting its “substantial further progress” goal on employment, and therefore, all else equal, will not compel them to consider reducing asset purchases sooner rather than later. There is much ground still to be made up in the labor market, and we believe the Fed will need to see a string of strong reports, likely in the one million range, before it begins to take action. From a Fed intervention standpoint, today’s employment report likely found a sweet spot, and the early indications are that equity markets are breathing a sigh of relief. For a deeper dive into the inflation picture, check the blog on Thursday, June 10, when data for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation is set to be released. Big First 5 Months Gains Consolidate Over Worst Months S&P 500 is up an impressive 11.9% for the first five months of 2021. That is the 16th best gain for the first five months since 1950. As illustrated in the graph above, gains do beget gains and this bodes well for the year as a whole. But this does not diminish the seasonal pattern of consolidation and mostly sideways market action over the Worst Six Months May-October and even more so over the Worst Four Months July-October. We tabulated the gains for the top 20 first five month gains since 1950 and the gains for the last seven months of the year are still pretty solid averaging 9.4% vs. 14.7% for the top 20 first five months. But the bulk of those gains as you can see in the graph come from late-October to yearend. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) June Swoon? Although there was some notable weakness in the middle of May, the S&P 500 Index was able to rally late in the month to finish with a modest gain. Incredibly, this was the eighth year out of the past nine that stocks gained during in May. Who said Sell in May? (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) As we noted a month ago, the worst six months of the year indeed are May through October, so we are still in the thick of a potentially challenging period based on seasonality. “After a nearly 90% rally off the lows, stocks could be ripe for a pullback, especially during the historically weak month of June,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But with the improving economy, coupled with historic fiscal and monetary stimulus, we expect any weakness to be short-lived.” (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Here are some stats to think about regarding S&P 500 performance in June: Since 1950, June is the 4th worst month of the year (September, February, and August are worse). It has been higher the past 5 years in a row, the longest since a stretch of 6 in a row in the late 1990s. The past 10 years, though, June was up 1.0% on average, ranking as the 7th best month. According to Sam Stovall of CFRA, only 5 market declines in excess of 5% started in June versus an average of 8 for all 12 months (since WWII). In other words, it isn’t common for major market weakness to start in June. Building on this, when the S&P 500 is lower in June, it is down by 2.9% on average. This is the second smallest average loss, with only December better at -2.5%. We wouldn’t be surprised at all if stocks took a well-deserved break in June, but this month is rather misunderstood, as a massive sell-off or the start of significant weakness isn’t likely, as that isn’t what June typically brings. Lastly, last Wednesday marked the 100th trading day of the year for the S&P 500. In fact, the S&P 500 was up more than 10% on the 100th day, which historically is a great start to the year, but also has meant continued strong performance the rest of the year is quite normal. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when stocks are up more than 10% on day 100, the rest of the year has been higher 84.2% of the time and up 8.6% on average, both well above what the average year does. We continue to recommend an overweight to equities and underweight to fixed-income position relative to investors’ targets, as appropriate. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Less Than 20% Bearish For the First Time in 115 Weeks Bullish sentiment measured through the AAII weekly survey was at the lowest level since the fall last week, but after jumping 7.7 percentage points, it is now at the highest level since the end of April. Not only is it high relative to the past few weeks, but the increase also brings bullish sentiment 6 percentage points back above its historical average. Additionally, the week over week increase was the largest since the week of April 8th when the reading had risen 11.1 percentage points. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) In recent weeks, neutral sentiment had been surging; topping 37% last week for the highest reading since the first week of 2020. Although it reversed lower this week down to 36.2%, neutral sentiment remains around some of the strongest levels in over a year. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) With the pickup in bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment plummeted to 19.8% on a 6.6 percentage point decile; the largest since February. Falling below 20%, bearish sentiment took out its March and April lows and is now at the lowest level since January 2018. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Not only is that one of the lowest readings in bearish sentiment in recent history, but that drop below 20% brought to an end a 115-week long streak of readings in bearish sentiment above that level. As shown below, that surpassed a three-week shorter streak ending in December 2017 to make for the second-longest such streak on record. The longest streak which ended in December 2010 went on for more than twice as long as this most recent run. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Historically, lower readings in bearish sentiment have tended towards weaker performance for the S&P 500 going forward as shown below. But when it comes to the past times that bearish sentiment has broken below 20% for the first time in at least 50 weeks, performance has actually tended to consistently be positive. In fact, across each of the past six instances, the S&P 500 has been higher six months out every time. Granted, for the most part the typical move higher is usually smaller than other periods. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Typical June Trading: Any Early Gains Tend to Fade Especially After Mid-Month Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-caps. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Main Street Sentiment Strongest in Over a Decade The U.S. economy is opening up and overall sentiment on Main Street is the strongest it’s been since our earliest analysis in 2005, according to LPL Research’s proprietary Beige Book Barometer (BBB). The result is based on our analysis of the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, a publication released two weeks before each Fed policy meeting that captures qualitative observations made by community bankers and business owners—what we like to think of as “Main Street” rather than “Wall Street.” The BBB gauges Main Street’s sentiment by looking at how frequently key words and phrases appear in the text. In the most recent Beige Book, “strong” words were near their highest since we first began tracking data in 2005 while weak words were their lowest on record, resulting in the strongest overall sentiment reading since inception. The strong reading is likely driven more by a change in direction than in overall activity, but even that is a welcome shift. “The country and the economy are going through a disruptive but positive change as most COVID-related restrictions are lifted and the economy reopens,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Sentiment is up and that’s a great sign for the direction of the economy.” (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) This was an important Beige Book in other ways. Mentions of COVID-related words (virus, COVID, pandemic) fell to their lowest level since the March 2020 Beige Book, when the words first started to appear. More concerning, words related to inflation also rose to their highest level since our earliest analysis. The downside of the economy’s rapid acceleration has been a mismatch between demand, which can ramp up quickly, and supply, which comes on line more slowly, while labor markets have also been slow to keep pace with reopening. Overall, the fundamental backdrop for the economy remains positive. Supply chain disruptions can slow the pace of the economic rebound but are likely temporary, while we expect reopening to be enduring. There is still some risk around variants, however, and full supply chain relief will likely need support from accelerated global vaccine distribution. US economic acceleration will probably peak in the second quarter, but there’s still plenty of scope for growth to moderate and still remain above average. Much of the positive news is already priced in for equity markets, which are forward looking, and gains may not come as easily, but we still see solid potential for upside as the economy continues to rebound. S&P 500 Returns Relative to History May has moved back to the rearview mirror and with that, we wanted to provide an update on how current long-term returns for the S&P 500 stack up relative to history. The chart below compares the trailing one, two, five, ten, and twenty-year annualized total returns of the S&P 500 to the S&P 500's historical average returns over those same time periods since 1928. We're starting to move away from the 'easy comps' in terms of market returns relative to the March 2020 lows, but the S&P 500 is still up more than 40% over the last 12 months which is nearly four times the historical average one year return. Over the last two years, the S&P 500's annualized return of 25.8% still comes in at more than twice the historical average of 10.6%. On a five and ten-year basis, the S&P 500's annualized gain also remains comfortably above 10%. All in all, the last decade has been very good for US equity investors. The only time period where the S&P 500 has experienced below-average returns is at the 20-year window where the 8.4% annualized gain clocks in at 2.5 percentage less than the historical average of 10.9%. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) The chart below compares the S&P 500's current returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to all other periods on a percentile basis. With mostly above-average returns, it comes as no surprise that most of the percentile readings rank above the 50th percentile, and for most time periods, the percentile rank comes in well above 50%. The one-year total return of more than 40% actually ranks just above the 93rd percentile, while the two-year return isn't far from the 90th percentile either. Moving further out, each of the other readings going out to ten years are all well above the 50th percentile. The only percentile rank below the 50th percentile is the 20-year window and that reading isn't even close. On the one hand, the last ten years have been phenomenal for equity investors, but the last 20 years haven't even been mediocre. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Throughout history, many investors have always worked under the assumption that long-term returns for the equity market are about 10%. History has shown that to be the case over the last decade at least, as the average annualized one-year gain of the S&P 500 has been well above 10%. With the S&P 500's current 20-year annualized gain currently at just 8.4%, though, what will it take for the S&P 500 to reach double-digit gains on an annualized basis over a 20-year window? For an idea, given the strong performance of the last ten years, a number of commentators suggest that the next ten years for equities will be weak with a reversion to the mean. Only time will tell, but if we operate under the (unlikely) assumption that the S&P 500 stays at the exact same level it is now going forward for the next ten years, its annualized twenty-year return would top 10% for the first time since August 2008 next September. After that brief period above 10% from September 2022 through March 2023, it wouldn't again top that level until February 2029. In spite of the fact that the annualized 20-year return would top 10% in those two periods, though, it still wouldn't get as high as the historical average of 10.9% in either of those periods. This reflects the fact that although the last ten years for US equities have been very strong, they also came shortly after one of the worst ten-year periods for US equities on record.

May Payrolls Not Too Hot, Not Too Cold Before diving into today’s jobs report for May, it will be a useful exercise to recall the curveball that April’s report threw at investors. One of the more hotly contested topics investors have been debating recently is what to make of the jobs report released one month ago, where the consensus expectation was for 1,000,000 new jobs and we only got 266,000 (since revised up to 278,000). On the one hand, data releases are volatile by nature and it is possible that the large miss could have been broadly dismissed as a “one off” among a package of otherwise very healthy economic data. On the other hand, it did confirm anecdotal evidence of difficult hiring conditions facing companies and reinforced the notion that some workers may be reluctant to return to the workforce for a whole host of reasons. Moreover, if the April report really did unearth new evidence of a weaker-than-expected jobs market in this latter scenario, should we view the effect as temporary or does it have staying power that could spell new trouble for the overall economic recovery? Against this backdrop, investors were hoping that today’s May jobs report would go a long way towards providing some definitive answers to these important questions. It did not. But, that might actually be a good thing. Here are some key takeaways: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ May employment report revealed that the domestic economy added 559,000 jobs in May, slightly below Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ median forecast for a gain of 675,000. The prior two months also received net positive revisions of 27,000 jobs. The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 5.8%, though that was paired with a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate, which moved from 61.7% to 61.6%. Average hourly earnings rose 0.5% month over month, again signaling lower-wage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected. More new lower-wage jobs would be expected to put more downward pressure on wage increases. “It is hard to view 559,000 added jobs as a disappointment, but it does leave something to be desired,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market > Strategist Ryan Detrick. “There is strong potential for job prints in excess of one million over the coming months, but the truth is as strong as the economy is right now, the employment backdrop is clearly lagging what we were all expecting just a few months ago.” As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, May’s jobs number did jump above April’s disappointment, but still came well short of making a fresh new high for 2021. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Where do we go from here? The US economy is still 7.6 million total payrolls shy of its peak prior to the recession, and given the magnitude of that number, we still believe there is the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months. Several catalysts should also lend a helping hand in the near future. Enhanced unemployment benefits may be deterring lower-wage workers from returning to the labor market, as they reduce the relative attractiveness of a paycheck from an employer. In the last month, about half of all states have started eliminating these added benefits in order to reduce the disincentive. We believe this should show up in the data starting with the June employment report. Also, schools might be closing for the summer, but daycare centers are reopening more broadly, freeing parents up to find jobs. Warmer weather, ever-improving vaccination trends, and increasing comfort reengaging in normal activities should all play their parts as well. The labor market will always be inextricably linked to the inflation outlook, this cycle perhaps more than past cycles, and for many that is the real story today. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has made it clear it will tolerate near-term inflation overshoots in order to achieve “substantial further progress” towards its employment goals before it begins taking measures to combat higher inflation. Recent hotter-than-expected inflation reports have increasingly turned the spotlight towards the Fed’s timeline for reducing their asset purchases, which, given their stated position, will depend on strong payroll reports. As such, we find ourselves (to a degree) in a “good news is bad news” scenario, as strong labor market readings could hasten the Fed’s timetable to begin normalizing monetary policy. Today’s report likely did little to convince the Fed that the labor market is closer to meeting its “substantial further progress” goal on employment, and therefore, all else equal, will not compel them to consider reducing asset purchases sooner rather than later. There is much ground still to be made up in the labor market, and we believe the Fed will need to see a string of strong reports, likely in the one million range, before it begins to take action. From a Fed intervention standpoint, today’s employment report likely found a sweet spot, and the early indications are that equity markets are breathing a sigh of relief. For a deeper dive into the inflation picture, check the blog on Thursday, June 10, when data for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation is set to be released. Big First 5 Months Gains Consolidate Over Worst Months S&P 500 is up an impressive 11.9% for the first five months of 2021. That is the 16th best gain for the first five months since 1950. As illustrated in the graph above, gains do beget gains and this bodes well for the year as a whole. But this does not diminish the seasonal pattern of consolidation and mostly sideways market action over the Worst Six Months May-October and even more so over the Worst Four Months July-October. We tabulated the gains for the top 20 first five month gains since 1950 and the gains for the last seven months of the year are still pretty solid averaging 9.4% vs. 14.7% for the top 20 first five months. But the bulk of those gains as you can see in the graph come from late-October to yearend. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) June Swoon? Although there was some notable weakness in the middle of May, the S&P 500 Index was able to rally late in the month to finish with a modest gain. Incredibly, this was the eighth year out of the past nine that stocks gained during in May. Who said Sell in May? (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) As we noted a month ago, the worst six months of the year indeed are May through October, so we are still in the thick of a potentially challenging period based on seasonality. “After a nearly 90% rally off the lows, stocks could be ripe for a pullback, especially during the historically weak month of June,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But with the improving economy, coupled with historic fiscal and monetary stimulus, we expect any weakness to be short-lived.” (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Here are some stats to think about regarding S&P 500 performance in June: Since 1950, June is the 4th worst month of the year (September, February, and August are worse). It has been higher the past 5 years in a row, the longest since a stretch of 6 in a row in the late 1990s. The past 10 years, though, June was up 1.0% on average, ranking as the 7th best month. According to Sam Stovall of CFRA, only 5 market declines in excess of 5% started in June versus an average of 8 for all 12 months (since WWII). In other words, it isn’t common for major market weakness to start in June. Building on this, when the S&P 500 is lower in June, it is down by 2.9% on average. This is the second smallest average loss, with only December better at -2.5%. We wouldn’t be surprised at all if stocks took a well-deserved break in June, but this month is rather misunderstood, as a massive sell-off or the start of significant weakness isn’t likely, as that isn’t what June typically brings. Lastly, last Wednesday marked the 100th trading day of the year for the S&P 500. In fact, the S&P 500 was up more than 10% on the 100th day, which historically is a great start to the year, but also has meant continued strong performance the rest of the year is quite normal. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when stocks are up more than 10% on day 100, the rest of the year has been higher 84.2% of the time and up 8.6% on average, both well above what the average year does. We continue to recommend an overweight to equities and underweight to fixed-income position relative to investors’ targets, as appropriate. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Less Than 20% Bearish For the First Time in 115 Weeks Bullish sentiment measured through the AAII weekly survey was at the lowest level since the fall last week, but after jumping 7.7 percentage points, it is now at the highest level since the end of April. Not only is it high relative to the past few weeks, but the increase also brings bullish sentiment 6 percentage points back above its historical average. Additionally, the week over week increase was the largest since the week of April 8th when the reading had risen 11.1 percentage points. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) In recent weeks, neutral sentiment had been surging; topping 37% last week for the highest reading since the first week of 2020. Although it reversed lower this week down to 36.2%, neutral sentiment remains around some of the strongest levels in over a year. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) With the pickup in bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment plummeted to 19.8% on a 6.6 percentage point decile; the largest since February. Falling below 20%, bearish sentiment took out its March and April lows and is now at the lowest level since January 2018. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Not only is that one of the lowest readings in bearish sentiment in recent history, but that drop below 20% brought to an end a 115-week long streak of readings in bearish sentiment above that level. As shown below, that surpassed a three-week shorter streak ending in December 2017 to make for the second-longest such streak on record. The longest streak which ended in December 2010 went on for more than twice as long as this most recent run. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Historically, lower readings in bearish sentiment have tended towards weaker performance for the S&P 500 going forward as shown below. But when it comes to the past times that bearish sentiment has broken below 20% for the first time in at least 50 weeks, performance has actually tended to consistently be positive. In fact, across each of the past six instances, the S&P 500 has been higher six months out every time. Granted, for the most part the typical move higher is usually smaller than other periods.

Typical June Trading: Any Early Gains Tend to Fade Especially After Mid-Month Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-caps. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Main Street Sentiment Strongest in Over a Decade The U.S. economy is opening up and overall sentiment on Main Street is the strongest it’s been since our earliest analysis in 2005, according to LPL Research’s proprietary Beige Book Barometer (BBB). The result is based on our analysis of the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, a publication released two weeks before each Fed policy meeting that captures qualitative observations made by community bankers and business owners—what we like to think of as “Main Street” rather than “Wall Street.” The BBB gauges Main Street’s sentiment by looking at how frequently key words and phrases appear in the text. In the most recent Beige Book, “strong” words were near their highest since we first began tracking data in 2005 while weak words were their lowest on record, resulting in the strongest overall sentiment reading since inception. The strong reading is likely driven more by a change in direction than in overall activity, but even that is a welcome shift. “The country and the economy are going through a disruptive but positive change as most COVID-related restrictions are lifted and the economy reopens,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Sentiment is up and that’s a great sign for the direction of the economy.” (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) This was an important Beige Book in other ways. Mentions of COVID-related words (virus, COVID, pandemic) fell to their lowest level since the March 2020 Beige Book, when the words first started to appear. More concerning, words related to inflation also rose to their highest level since our earliest analysis. The downside of the economy’s rapid acceleration has been a mismatch between demand, which can ramp up quickly, and supply, which comes on line more slowly, while labor markets have also been slow to keep pace with reopening. Overall, the fundamental backdrop for the economy remains positive. Supply chain disruptions can slow the pace of the economic rebound but are likely temporary, while we expect reopening to be enduring. There is still some risk around variants, however, and full supply chain relief will likely need support from accelerated global vaccine distribution. US economic acceleration will probably peak in the second quarter, but there’s still plenty of scope for growth to moderate and still remain above average. Much of the positive news is already priced in for equity markets, which are forward looking, and gains may not come as easily, but we still see solid potential for upside as the economy continues to rebound. S&P 500 Returns Relative to History May has moved back to the rearview mirror and with that, we wanted to provide an update on how current long-term returns for the S&P 500 stack up relative to history. The chart below compares the trailing one, two, five, ten, and twenty-year annualized total returns of the S&P 500 to the S&P 500's historical average returns over those same time periods since 1928. We're starting to move away from the 'easy comps' in terms of market returns relative to the March 2020 lows, but the S&P 500 is still up more than 40% over the last 12 months which is nearly four times the historical average one year return. Over the last two years, the S&P 500's annualized return of 25.8% still comes in at more than twice the historical average of 10.6%. On a five and ten-year basis, the S&P 500's annualized gain also remains comfortably above 10%. All in all, the last decade has been very good for US equity investors. The only time period where the S&P 500 has experienced below-average returns is at the 20-year window where the 8.4% annualized gain clocks in at 2.5 percentage less than the historical average of 10.9%. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) The chart below compares the S&P 500's current returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to all other periods on a percentile basis. With mostly above-average returns, it comes as no surprise that most of the percentile readings rank above the 50th percentile, and for most time periods, the percentile rank comes in well above 50%. The one-year total return of more than 40% actually ranks just above the 93rd percentile, while the two-year return isn't far from the 90th percentile either. Moving further out, each of the other readings going out to ten years are all well above the 50th percentile. The only percentile rank below the 50th percentile is the 20-year window and that reading isn't even close. On the one hand, the last ten years have been phenomenal for equity investors, but the last 20 years haven't even been mediocre. (CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!) Throughout history, many investors have always worked under the assumption that long-term returns for the equity market are about 10%. History has shown that to be the case over the last decade at least, as the average annualized one-year gain of the S&P 500 has been well above 10%. With the S&P 500's current 20-year annualized gain currently at just 8.4%, though, what will it take for the S&P 500 to reach double-digit gains on an annualized basis over a 20-year window? For an idea, given the strong performance of the last ten years, a number of commentators suggest that the next ten years for equities will be weak with a reversion to the mean. Only time will tell, but if we operate under the (unlikely) assumption that the S&P 500 stays at the exact same level it is now going forward for the next ten years, its annualized twenty-year return would top 10% for the first time since August 2008 next September. After that brief period above 10% from September 2022 through March 2023, it wouldn't again top that level until February 2029. In spite of the fact that the annualized 20-year return would top 10% in those two periods, though, it still wouldn't get as high as the historical average of 10.9% in either of those periods. This reflects the fact that although the last ten years for US equities have been very strong, they also came shortly after one of the worst ten-year periods for US equities on record.
