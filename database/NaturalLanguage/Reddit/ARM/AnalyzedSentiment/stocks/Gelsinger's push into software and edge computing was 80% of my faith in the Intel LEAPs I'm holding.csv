,"Intel was making some interesting moves into software offerings, edge computing, software, and toolkits for AI development since Gelsinger was brought on.

My faith in the current executive leadership is shaky, however; Michelle Johnston Holthaus is certainly an Intel stalwart but her background is in marketing and sales.Waiting until it picks up steam into multiple billions may be her move before she starts trying to throw around marketing money to get its name out there, but at this point I would just be hopefully speculating. I'm a tech professional (gross simplification but I'll spare the paragraphs explaining the minutiae of what I specialize in) and my own investigation into their cloud computing offerings had me impressed both with the prices and the power they offer for computing; it's what made me pull the trigger on the LEAPs, truth be told.",1,0.533,POSITIVE,0.991

I didn't care for the guy either, but this tells me they have no damn idea what they are doing.I work in IT. I live and breath tech every single day. The majority of datacenters around the world run on Intel. I am seeing a small shift with some AMD clusters, but the majority is still team blue. I've often seen more desktops with AMD, but that's about it. Virtualized servers aren't focused on the fastest processors in the world. Core count, cache, ram, storage, and redundancy are the focus. But I will say AMD is winning the efficiency race. If they can keep giving higher core counts and lower TDP, then the market might shift. Intel has time to restructure. Idk if they can, but we will see.If I want to game at home, then I play on my 7800x3d, but if I am doing work for a company then it is Xeon all the way. AMD needs to focus on enterprise equipment more if they want a real shift in the market.",0,0.549,NEGATIVE,1.0
