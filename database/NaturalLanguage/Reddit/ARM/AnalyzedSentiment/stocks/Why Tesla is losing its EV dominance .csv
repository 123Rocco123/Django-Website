,"Tesla ($TSLA) should be looking over its shoulder at the fully charged EVs barreling right toward its castle. While Elon Musk's non-Twitter creation still has a stronghold on the EV market based on name recognition, market share, and production capabilities, the clear takeaway from this year’s New York International Auto Show (which Tesla was not a part of) is that traditional automakers such as Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Nissan (NSANY) are all gunning for Tesla's dominance and lucrative profit margins. Hyundai aims to lead the EV pack “Tesla who,” Hyundai Motor Americas CEO Randy Parker quipped when Yahoo Finance Live asked about Hyundai's IONIQ 6, an EV that was named 'Car of the Year' for 2023. The impressive specs and pricing of Hyundai's IONIQ 6 places it in direct competition with Tesla's Model 3, the second-most-popular EV in the U.S. Hyundai's IONIQ 6 starts at $41,600 with a range of up to 240 miles. By comparison, the $41,990 Model 3 reaches 272 miles on one charge. Gap closed. “The IONIQ 6 from a technology standpoint, you can’t do better,” Parker crowed. And it’s that type of Tesla mentality that’s likely to test the EV leadership of Musk's EV outfit. Older automakers known for their gas-powered rides are ramping up their push into the EV market with edgy new styles and attractive specs like those showcased at this year's New York Auto Show, including the Kia EV9, Nissan Ariya, Chevrolet Equinox EV, and Ram 1500 REV electric truck. These will be added to a class of solid EVs already in the market like Ford's F-150 Lightning and Mach-E and the coming Chevy Silverado. What's next for Tesla Tesla's Cybertruck isn't even on the market yet. The company is reportedly working on a compact EV dubbed the Model 2, but it's unclear when that will arrive. S&P Global estimates the EV market will grow from just over 50 models today to 78 by year-end before more than doubling to 160 by the end of 2025. S&P Global Mobility’s Tom Libby told Yahoo Finance in a chat that ""competitive pressure is pushing OEMs to move quickly,' and that Tesla's market share will ‘keep declining' as a result. The inroads into Tesla's dominance are already being felt without question. General Motors sold more than 20,000 EVs for the first time in a quarter, fueled by demand for its cheaper Chevy Bolt EV, which accounted for 95% of the auto giant’s EV sales. And according to GM, Bolt sales are expected to soar to reach 70,000 by the end of this year. That may not sound too impressive when you compare it to Tesla’s record first-quarter delivery numbers, which totaled 422,875 globally. But data compiled by S&P Global Mobility shows Tesla's competitors are gaining ground. Tesla’s U.S. EV share subsequently fell from nearly three-quarters of the market in January 2022 to just over half in January 2023. Within that same time frame, General Motors' EV market share grew from 0.1% to 9.9%, and Ford’s foothold grew to 8.4%. The pressure on Tesla is one of the factors forcing the carmaker to slash prices again. Tesla marked down its vehicles for the fifth time this year, its latest effort to boost demand and regain lost market share. ""In this EV arms race Tesla needs to defend their turf and customer base with price cuts,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in an email to Yahoo Finance. ""Everyone is trying to catch up. Tesla cutting prices were the near-term pain for long-term gain strategic poker move."" RBC analyst Tom Narayan also thinks lower prices could help Tesla's demand issue, telling Yahoo Finance Live that lower prices are a ""great way to really steal market share."" Despite some upbeat outlooks from Wall Street on price cuts and the fact Tesla's stock has been a favorite among investors since the start of the year, shares are still off more than 40% in the past 12 months. That's a much starker decline than competitors Ford and General Motors, with respective one-year drops of 14% and 10%. The relative underperformance of Tesla's stock proves some investors are looking at its recent price cuts and quarterly delivery miss as a sign of trouble ahead for the electric vehicle maker.

What's next for Tesla Tesla's Cybertruck isn't even on the market yet. The company is reportedly working on a compact EV dubbed the Model 2, but it's unclear when that will arrive. S&P Global estimates the EV market will grow from just over 50 models today to 78 by year-end before more than doubling to 160 by the end of 2025. S&P Global Mobility’s Tom Libby told Yahoo Finance in a chat that ""competitive pressure is pushing OEMs to move quickly,' and that Tesla's market share will ‘keep declining' as a result. The inroads into Tesla's dominance are already being felt without question. General Motors sold more than 20,000 EVs for the first time in a quarter, fueled by demand for its cheaper Chevy Bolt EV, which accounted for 95% of the auto giant’s EV sales. And according to GM, Bolt sales are expected to soar to reach 70,000 by the end of this year. That may not sound too impressive when you compare it to Tesla’s record first-quarter delivery numbers, which totaled 422,875 globally. But data compiled by S&P Global Mobility shows Tesla's competitors are gaining ground. Tesla’s U.S. EV share subsequently fell from nearly three-quarters of the market in January 2022 to just over half in January 2023. Within that same time frame, General Motors' EV market share grew from 0.1% to 9.9%, and Ford’s foothold grew to 8.4%. The pressure on Tesla is one of the factors forcing the carmaker to slash prices again. Tesla marked down its vehicles for the fifth time this year, its latest effort to boost demand and regain lost market share. ""In this EV arms race Tesla needs to defend their turf and customer base with price cuts,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in an email to Yahoo Finance. ""Everyone is trying to catch up. Tesla cutting prices were the near-term pain for long-term gain strategic poker move."" RBC analyst Tom Narayan also thinks lower prices could help Tesla's demand issue, telling Yahoo Finance Live that lower prices are a ""great way to really steal market share."" Despite some upbeat outlooks from Wall Street on price cuts and the fact Tesla's stock has been a favorite among investors since the start of the year, shares are still off more than 40% in the past 12 months. That's a much starker decline than competitors Ford and General Motors, with respective one-year drops of 14% and 10%. The relative underperformance of Tesla's stock proves some investors are looking at its recent price cuts and quarterly delivery miss as a sign of trouble ahead for the electric vehicle maker. And perhaps a sign that mighty Tesla is losing its grip on an industry it has dominated for the last five years.","They can't make enough batteries to meet demand, the same as most other OEMs not investing heavily in their own battery manufacturing with partners. VW and Ford shifted to SK innovations and then LG energy sued and won to stop their production facilities in Georgia that was to supply F150 and iD4 models. LG energy sells to the big 3 and some Tesla cells while Panasonic is still their main supplier.4680 form factor is very new and only a few companies like Tesla are leading in improving cell design manufacturing inhouse rather than let the 3rd party suppliers just sue each other and get involved in their own under actual demand estimates given to them by OEMs who vastly underestimate demand alongside not wanting to make more BEVs at a loss. Car companies need to transition better into battery manufacturing and so far only a handful are pushing instead of pulling on 3rd parties to do the cost reductions, which why would they pass the cost savings on to OEMs when demand is still so high a big part why they are unprofitable at selling BEVs trying to gain market share.",1,0.532,0.999,NEGATIVE

The simple fact that Stellantis and VW's largest market is in Europe and Tesla is #2 in EV sales is problematic for European automakers. Your comment with the links didn't tell the full story so I simply provided a better source.Which automakers are profitable selling pure EV's? Go down the list. You'll find that outside of Tesla, possibly the only other automaker profitable selling EV's is BYD and that's only when you consider the subsidies they receive from China. Without those subsidies, they are likely unprofitable but it's difficult to really say because BYD doesn't report PHEV and BEV numbers separately. Every other automaker encounters significant losses selling EV's and there is a huge transition cost that is taking place with for example, Ford estimating that they will lose $5 billion in 2022/2023 selling EV's. I mean, you mentioned Stellantis. Their CEO has publicly came out and said EV's are too expensive for them to make. They are unprofitable selling EV's. VW is unprofitable selling EV's. GM is unprofitable selling EV's. Now, consider that Tesla is not only profitable selling EV's, they have the highest margins in the auto industry for all major sales vehicles. Think about that for a second: Other automakers are losing massive amounts of money selling EV's while Tesla is making the highest margins in the auto industry selling EV's. When you consider that the future of the auto market is 100% heading towards EV's, the math becomes quite clear.BYD only sells vehicles primarily in China and some Asian countries. Tesla not selling as many vehicles as BYD in China isn't the end-all, be-all. They just have to have a sizable enough market. How many foreign automakers do you think can enter a country and completely dominate that market? It doesn't happen in the largest countries.""But Tesla is worth more than all the automakers combined."" Well, why do you think that is? Because traditional automakers have had declined growth. Take for example, Ford. 2004 revenue: $177 billion, 2022 revenue: $158 billion. You investing your hard-earned money into a company that has declined revenue from nearly two decades ago? Ford's stock price 2004: $14.50, Ford's stock price currently: $12.50. I'll ask again, are you investing in this if you're looking to make money? Traditionally, auto companies haven't been good investments. Hence, why people don't invest in them which results in a lower market cap. Tesla, and to a lesser degree, some other EV companies are exceptions. Why? Because Tesla is experiencing rapid growth year over year while selling a new product in the auto industry. Some other EV companies, such as LUCID/Rivian are complete crap but because investors are looking for alternatives to legacy OEM's which don't perform well in the market, they are looking for the next 'Tesla' in the market.FYI, Tesla isn't just a car business. Which automaker do you know has the largest EV charging business in the world? Which automaker do you know is directly investing into robotics? Which automaker do you know has as much knowledge in self-driving capabilities as Tesla? Which automaker do you know is building energy storage factories? Which automaker do you know is actively building their parts in-house? Which automaker do you know develops their own software?https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/09/tesla-to-open-a-new-megafactory-in-shanghai-china-company-says.htmlIn due time, all of this will be even more evident. Remember, Tesla in 2018 was on the verge of bankruptcy. Tesla in 2022 just had the best selling passenger vehicle in terms of revenue (Model Y) and in 2023, the Model Y is projected to be the best selling passenger vehicle by unit sales.

That may not sound too impressive when you compare it to Tesla’s record first-quarter delivery numbers, which totaled 422,875 globally. But data compiled by S&P Global Mobility shows Tesla's competitors are gaining ground. Tesla’s U.S. EV share subsequently fell from nearly three-quarters of the market in January 2022 to just over half in January 2023.

The pressure on Tesla is one of the factors forcing the carmaker to slash prices again.

,"Tesla ($TSLA) should be looking over its shoulder at the fully charged EVs barreling right toward its castle. While Elon Musk's non-Twitter creation still has a stronghold on the EV market based on name recognition, market share, and production capabilities, the clear takeaway from this year’s New York International Auto Show (which Tesla was not a part of) is that traditional automakers such as Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Nissan (NSANY) are all gunning for Tesla's dominance and lucrative profit margins. Hyundai aims to lead the EV pack “Tesla who,” Hyundai Motor Americas CEO Randy Parker quipped when Yahoo Finance Live asked about Hyundai's IONIQ 6, an EV that was named 'Car of the Year' for 2023. The impressive specs and pricing of Hyundai's IONIQ 6 places it in direct competition with Tesla's Model 3, the second-most-popular EV in the U.S. Hyundai's IONIQ 6 starts at $41,600 with a range of up to 240 miles. By comparison, the $41,990 Model 3 reaches 272 miles on one charge. Gap closed. “The IONIQ 6 from a technology standpoint, you can’t do better,” Parker crowed. And it’s that type of Tesla mentality that’s likely to test the EV leadership of Musk's EV outfit. Older automakers known for their gas-powered rides are ramping up their push into the EV market with edgy new styles and attractive specs like those showcased at this year's New York Auto Show, including the Kia EV9, Nissan Ariya, Chevrolet Equinox EV, and Ram 1500 REV electric truck. These will be added to a class of solid EVs already in the market like Ford's F-150 Lightning and Mach-E and the coming Chevy Silverado. What's next for Tesla Tesla's Cybertruck isn't even on the market yet. The company is reportedly working on a compact EV dubbed the Model 2, but it's unclear when that will arrive. S&P Global estimates the EV market will grow from just over 50 models today to 78 by year-end before more than doubling to 160 by the end of 2025. S&P Global Mobility’s Tom Libby told Yahoo Finance in a chat that ""competitive pressure is pushing OEMs to move quickly,' and that Tesla's market share will ‘keep declining' as a result. The inroads into Tesla's dominance are already being felt without question. General Motors sold more than 20,000 EVs for the first time in a quarter, fueled by demand for its cheaper Chevy Bolt EV, which accounted for 95% of the auto giant’s EV sales. And according to GM, Bolt sales are expected to soar to reach 70,000 by the end of this year. That may not sound too impressive when you compare it to Tesla’s record first-quarter delivery numbers, which totaled 422,875 globally. But data compiled by S&P Global Mobility shows Tesla's competitors are gaining ground. Tesla’s U.S. EV share subsequently fell from nearly three-quarters of the market in January 2022 to just over half in January 2023.

Hyundai aims to lead the EV pack “Tesla who,” Hyundai Motor Americas CEO Randy Parker quipped when Yahoo Finance Live asked about Hyundai's IONIQ 6, an EV that was named 'Car of the Year' for 2023. The impressive specs and pricing of Hyundai's IONIQ 6 places it in direct competition with Tesla's Model 3, the second-most-popular EV in the U.S. Hyundai's IONIQ 6 starts at $41,600 with a range of up to 240 miles. By comparison, the $41,990 Model 3 reaches 272 miles on one charge. Gap closed. “The IONIQ 6 from a technology standpoint, you can’t do better,” Parker crowed. And it’s that type of Tesla mentality that’s likely to test the EV leadership of Musk's EV outfit. Older automakers known for their gas-powered rides are ramping up their push into the EV market with edgy new styles and attractive specs like those showcased at this year's New York Auto Show, including the Kia EV9, Nissan Ariya, Chevrolet Equinox EV, and Ram 1500 REV electric truck.

S&P Global estimates the EV market will grow from just over 50 models today to 78 by year-end before more than doubling to 160 by the end of 2025. S&P Global Mobility’s Tom Libby told Yahoo Finance in a chat that ""competitive pressure is pushing OEMs to move quickly,' and that Tesla's market share will ‘keep declining' as a result. The inroads into Tesla's dominance are already being felt without question. General Motors sold more than 20,000 EVs for the first time in a quarter, fueled by demand for its cheaper Chevy Bolt EV, which accounted for 95% of the auto giant’s EV sales. And according to GM, Bolt sales are expected to soar to reach 70,000 by the end of this year. That may not sound too impressive when you compare it to Tesla’s record first-quarter delivery numbers, which totaled 422,875 globally. But data compiled by S&P Global Mobility shows Tesla's competitors are gaining ground. Tesla’s U.S. EV share subsequently fell from nearly three-quarters of the market in January 2022 to just over half in January 2023.

While GM and Ford have been closing factories for lack of computer chips, Tesla has been racking up record sales every quarter. In 2022, they sold double the amount of card in 2020.One reason is the technology dominance used in Tesla manufacturing. The other is they own their own supply chain. About the only thing not owned is the battery. Chip issues impacted Tesla too, but they rewrote the software for the chips they could get. They also could do this because they didn't outsource their programmers, something just about every car company was doing to save money.

While Elon Musk's non-Twitter creation still has a stronghold on the EV market based on name recognition, market share, and production capabilities, the clear takeaway from this year’s New York International Auto Show (which Tesla was not a part of) is that traditional automakers such as Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Nissan (NSANY) are all gunning for Tesla's dominance and lucrative profit margins. Hyundai aims to lead the EV pack “Tesla who,” Hyundai Motor Americas CEO Randy Parker quipped when Yahoo Finance Live asked about Hyundai's IONIQ 6, an EV that was named 'Car of the Year' for 2023. The impressive specs and pricing of Hyundai's IONIQ 6 places it in direct competition with Tesla's Model 3, the second-most-popular EV in the U.S. Hyundai's IONIQ 6 starts at $41,600 with a range of up to 240 miles. By comparison, the $41,990 Model 3 reaches 272 miles on one charge. Gap closed. “The IONIQ 6 from a technology standpoint, you can’t do better,” Parker crowed. And it’s that type of Tesla mentality that’s likely to test the EV leadership of Musk's EV outfit. Older automakers known for their gas-powered rides are ramping up their push into the EV market with edgy new styles and attractive specs like those showcased at this year's New York Auto Show, including the Kia EV9, Nissan Ariya, Chevrolet Equinox EV, and Ram 1500 REV electric truck. These will be added to a class of solid EVs already in the market like Ford's F-150 Lightning and Mach-E and the coming Chevy Silverado. What's next for Tesla Tesla's Cybertruck isn't even on the market yet. The company is reportedly working on a compact EV dubbed the Model 2, but it's unclear when that will arrive. S&P Global estimates the EV market will grow from just over 50 models today to 78 by year-end before more than doubling to 160 by the end of 2025. S&P Global Mobility’s Tom Libby told Yahoo Finance in a chat that ""competitive pressure is pushing OEMs to move quickly,' and that Tesla's market share will ‘keep declining' as a result. The inroads into Tesla's dominance are already being felt without question. General Motors sold more than 20,000 EVs for the first time in a quarter, fueled by demand for its cheaper Chevy Bolt EV, which accounted for 95% of the auto giant’s EV sales. And according to GM, Bolt sales are expected to soar to reach 70,000 by the end of this year. That may not sound too impressive when you compare it to Tesla’s record first-quarter delivery numbers, which totaled 422,875 globally. But data compiled by S&P Global Mobility shows Tesla's competitors are gaining ground. Tesla’s U.S. EV share subsequently fell from nearly three-quarters of the market in January 2022 to just over half in January 2023. Within that same time frame, General Motors' EV market share grew from 0.1% to 9.9%, and Ford’s foothold grew to 8.4%.

The impressive specs and pricing of Hyundai's IONIQ 6 places it in direct competition with Tesla's Model 3, the second-most-popular EV in the U.S. Hyundai's IONIQ 6 starts at $41,600 with a range of up to 240 miles. By comparison, the $41,990 Model 3 reaches 272 miles on one charge. Gap closed. “The IONIQ 6 from a technology standpoint, you can’t do better,” Parker crowed. And it’s that type of Tesla mentality that’s likely to test the EV leadership of Musk's EV outfit. Older automakers known for their gas-powered rides are ramping up their push into the EV market with edgy new styles and attractive specs like those showcased at this year's New York Auto Show, including the Kia EV9, Nissan Ariya, Chevrolet Equinox EV, and Ram 1500 REV electric truck.

The inroads into Tesla's dominance are already being felt without question.

That may not sound too impressive when you compare it to Tesla’s record first-quarter delivery numbers, which totaled 422,875 globally.

The problem is it is an unsustainable business model. They are not profitable and sell few units. If the objective was to sell few units and lose money selling a good EV, Hyundai is winning.Chevy Bolt, lol. I love how you use forecasted Chevy Bolt sales for the year versus Tesla current Q1 sales. Why do you not use the forecasted Tesla sales for the year? Instead you want to make it seem close by comparing a quarterly amount versus the yearly amount? FYI, Tesla is expected to do 1.8-1.9 million EV sales for 2023. Chevy Bolt is expected to do 70,000 for 2023. In which way is this close?Tesla is cutting prices because during COVID when everyone had money, they continued to increase the prices of their vehicles. With a looming recession and economic downturn with higher rates, it was unsustainable for Tesla to sell their vehicles at that same price. It's common sense.""Cybertruck isn't out yet.""Literally coming out by this year.""Model 2 unknown date.""Expected to release within the next year or two considering Tom Zhu has said they expect Giga Monterrey to start operating quicker than Shanghai (which only took ~year to begin manufacturing vehicles.)

The impressive specs and pricing of Hyundai's IONIQ 6 places it in direct competition with Tesla's Model 3, the second-most-popular EV in the U.S. Hyundai's IONIQ 6 starts at $41,600 with a range of up to 240 miles. By comparison, the $41,990 Model 3 reaches 272 miles on one charge. Gap closed. “The IONIQ 6 from a technology standpoint, you can’t do better,” Parker crowed. And it’s that type of Tesla mentality that’s likely to test the EV leadership of Musk's EV outfit. Older automakers known for their gas-powered rides are ramping up their push into the EV market with edgy new styles and attractive specs like those showcased at this year's New York Auto Show, including the Kia EV9, Nissan Ariya, Chevrolet Equinox EV, and Ram 1500 REV electric truck.

That may not sound too impressive when you compare it to Tesla’s record first-quarter delivery numbers, which totaled 422,875 globally.

By comparison, the $41,990 Model 3 reaches 272 miles on one charge. Gap closed. “The IONIQ 6 from a technology standpoint, you can’t do better,” Parker crowed.

It wouldn't make sense for Tesla to stop producing two Model Y's for one Cybertruck when the demand for the Model Y is high.Ford rushed to manufacture the Ford Lightning because the Ford brand is all about the pickup truck segment. That is their bread-and-butter. So from a purely marketing standpoint, Ford couldn't afford to not be the first in the market for an EV pickup. For Tesla, it simply didn't make financial sense to do so because EV pickups are less profitable, require more batteries, and you can only sell them in America. Model Y and Model 3 are vehicles designed to be sold across the world. Hence, starting a manufacturing line that would take away from Model 3/Model Y sales when there is a battery constraint is bad strategy.As for FSD, I agree with you. They should have never marketed it as something that could be accomplished easily. But they are still ahead of any other competitor in this area and to be fair, their FSD Beta works well in many areas without having to take over the steering.",2,0.528,1.0,NEGATIVE

,"Tesla ($TSLA) should be looking over its shoulder at the fully charged EVs barreling right toward its castle. While Elon Musk's non-Twitter creation still has a stronghold on the EV market based on name recognition, market share, and production capabilities, the clear takeaway from this year’s New York International Auto Show (which Tesla was not a part of) is that traditional automakers such as Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Nissan (NSANY) are all gunning for Tesla's dominance and lucrative profit margins. Hyundai aims to lead the EV pack “Tesla who,” Hyundai Motor Americas CEO Randy Parker quipped when Yahoo Finance Live asked about Hyundai's IONIQ 6, an EV that was named 'Car of the Year' for 2023. The impressive specs and pricing of Hyundai's IONIQ 6 places it in direct competition with Tesla's Model 3, the second-most-popular EV in the U.S. Hyundai's IONIQ 6 starts at $41,600 with a range of up to 240 miles. By comparison, the $41,990 Model 3 reaches 272 miles on one charge. Gap closed. “The IONIQ 6 from a technology standpoint, you can’t do better,” Parker crowed. And it’s that type of Tesla mentality that’s likely to test the EV leadership of Musk's EV outfit. Older automakers known for their gas-powered rides are ramping up their push into the EV market with edgy new styles and attractive specs like those showcased at this year's New York Auto Show, including the Kia EV9, Nissan Ariya, Chevrolet Equinox EV, and Ram 1500 REV electric truck. These will be added to a class of solid EVs already in the market like Ford's F-150 Lightning and Mach-E and the coming Chevy Silverado. What's next for Tesla Tesla's Cybertruck isn't even on the market yet. The company is reportedly working on a compact EV dubbed the Model 2, but it's unclear when that will arrive. S&P Global estimates the EV market will grow from just over 50 models today to 78 by year-end before more than doubling to 160 by the end of 2025. S&P Global Mobility’s Tom Libby told Yahoo Finance in a chat that ""competitive pressure is pushing OEMs to move quickly,' and that Tesla's market share will ‘keep declining' as a result. The inroads into Tesla's dominance are already being felt without question. General Motors sold more than 20,000 EVs for the first time in a quarter, fueled by demand for its cheaper Chevy Bolt EV, which accounted for 95% of the auto giant’s EV sales. And according to GM, Bolt sales are expected to soar to reach 70,000 by the end of this year. That may not sound too impressive when you compare it to Tesla’s record first-quarter delivery numbers, which totaled 422,875 globally. But data compiled by S&P Global Mobility shows Tesla's competitors are gaining ground. Tesla’s U.S. EV share subsequently fell from nearly three-quarters of the market in January 2022 to just over half in January 2023. Within that same time frame, General Motors' EV market share grew from 0.1% to 9.9%, and Ford’s foothold grew to 8.4%. The pressure on Tesla is one of the factors forcing the carmaker to slash prices again. Tesla marked down its vehicles for the fifth time this year, its latest effort to boost demand and regain lost market share.
