,"A flurry of Wall Street ratings boosted Rivian Automotive Inc. stock on Monday, nearly a month after the company went public, with analysts giving the Amazon-backed electric-vehicle maker mostly bullish endorsements. Of the 13 analysts surveyed by FactSet, eight set ratings on Rivian that were the equivalent of buy, while the other five rated it the equivalent of hold. There are so far no bears. The average price target on the stock was $134.42, which was about 28% above Friday’s stock closing price of $104.67, and about 72% above the $78 initial public offering price. The stock RIVN, +11.57% surged more than 4% on Monday, putting it on track to snap a four-session losing streak. It was now trading 37% below its Nov. 16 high close of $172.01, but was still 39% above its IPO price. Baird analyst George Gianarikas initiated Rivian at outperform with a $150 stock price target, saying he believes the company can “formidably challenge” Tesla Inc.’s TSLA, -0.59% market dominance. He said the company has adopted a “promising, vertically integrated approach,” reinforced by a robust balance sheet, Amazon partnership and strong recruitment. “Vertical integration, however, requires scale to extract benefits, and, as such, Rivian needs to ramp quickly and effectively to materialize as a serious long-term contender,” Gianarikas wrote in a note to clients. “That is, Clark Kent ([Chairman and Chief Executive] RJ Scaringe) needs to emerge from the phone booth as Superman soon to scale Rivian and save the planet.” Wedbush’s Dan Ives also started Rivian with a bullish outperform rating, and set a $130 stock price target, saying the “stalwart EV startup” is looking to strategically launch itself into an untapped market as SUV and pickup truck EVs are currently virtually nonexistent in the EV market. He said Rivian’s debut R1T and R1S EVs are expected to launch in early 2022, competing with General Motors Co.’s GM, +0.22% new Hummer, Ford Motor Co.’s F, +0.42% F-150 and, down the road, Tesla’s Cybertruck. “With the popularity and consumer demand for EVs on the trucking/SUV market, we believe Rivian is in the catbird’s seat to take considerable market share in the EV arms race under its visionary CEO and founder, R.J. Scaringe,” Ives wrote. How are the others rating Rivian? Analyst Ryan Brinkman at J.P. Morgan, which was one of the lead underwriters of Rivian’s IPO, started the company at neutral with a stock price target of $104 John Murphy at B. of A. Securities started their coverage on Rivian with a buy rating and a $170 price target.

It's the Software stupid.Cathie Wood-led Ark Invest said on Monday that Tesla Inc’s (NASDAQ: TSLA) latest move to allow car sharing on its mobile app brings its user one step closer towards monetizing their electric car and transforming it from a ""stranded asset"" into a ""revenue generating machine.""What Happened: Ark analyst Tasha Keeney said speculation has been rife that Tesla is planning a ride-hailing network after its recent software update that allows owners to share the vehicle with others via the phone app.A Twitter account that monitors the app store for any new updates on the Tesla app, had last week revealed that the new version of the electric vehicle maker’s mobile app has a feature that allows owners to share cars.Version 4.3.1 has been released here's what we've found:-Sharing your Tesla vehicle with others-Asset for vehicle sharing-Endpoints related to vehicle sharingThat's about it in this update, if we find anything else we will add to this thread! Have a great night! pic.twitter.com/xkR7Qluk5z— Tesla App Updates (iOS) (@Tesla_App_iOS) December 3, 2021The update appears to enable Tesla owners to allow multiple drivers access to their cars through the mobile app, which was previously only possible through the website.Ark has previously noted how Tesla could launch a competitive and profitable human-driven ride-hail service before rolling out an autonomous taxi network.“Such a strategy could add a tremendous amount of training data to its autonomous neural network and lay the groundwork for the routing and payment infrastructure necessary for an autonomous ride-hail service,” Keeney wrote in a note.The latest update would allow family members, car renters, and professional ride-hail drivers to share virtual keys to their Tesla vehicles, as per the analyst, which could ultimately allow a Tesla vehicle to be transformed from a ""stranded asset"" into a ""revenue generating machine.""See Also: Why Cathie Wood's Ark Expects Next Major EV Adoption Cycle Around $25,000 Price PointWhy It Matters: Wood’s money managing firm, which counts Tesla as its largest holding, has previously said it believes the Musk-led company could pose a serious threat to ride-sharing companies such as Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER) and Lyft Inc (NASDAQ: LYFT), once autonomous taxis commercialize.Musk has previously talked about launching a ride-hailing service with drivers before rolling out an autonomous driving network.The Tesla CEO has been promising fully self-driven electric cars for years. The company had last week launched another update for the Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta program with focus on vision, object detection, and the precision of movements by the vehicle.The FSD Beta updates are released every two weeks and are led by an army of Tesla owners, or beta testers, who have exclusive access to the automaker’s newest and most robust releases of its semi-autonomous driving program.So far only drivers who have a score of 98, 99 and 100 are part of the exclusive club which is likely to expand to lower scores in the future.",0,0.534,1.0,NEGATIVE

Scaringe,” Ives wrote. How are the others rating Rivian? Analyst Ryan Brinkman at J.P.
