,"Frontline Ltd., a shipping company, engages in the seaborne transportation of crude oil and oil products worldwide. It owns and operates oil and product tankers. As of December 31, 2020, the company operated a fleet of 68 vessels. It is also involved in the charter, purchase, and sale of vessels. Starting with a PE ratio of 4 and a PB ratio of 1 is always a good start. But then again most taker companies are now trading at a low PE ratio. Their net income, revenue and profit margin were increasing in the last 3 years which is a really good sign. One not so good sign is their debt which has increased from 1.8 to 2.2 billion in the last 4 years. You could consider that shipping oil is not a good business anymore because renewables but changing to renewables cannot be done in an instant so the transition will be slow. For example the Chinese oil consumption reached an all time high in December 2020. In the same time a lot of companies have reduced their number of shipping vessels due to the low demand in last year. To take something from their SEC filling regarding risk: “The demand for our oil tankers derives primarily from demand for Arabian Gulf, West African, North Sea, Caribbean, Russian and US Shale crude oil, which, in turn, primarily depends on the economies of the world's industrial countries and competition from alternative energy sources. Any decrease in shipments of crude oil or change in trade patterns from the above mentioned geographical areas would have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Among the factors which could lead to such a decrease are: • increased crude oil production from other areas; • increased refining capacity in the Arabian Gulf or West Africa; • increased use of existing and future crude oil pipelines in the Arabian Gulf or West Africa; • a decision by oil-producing nations to increase their crude oil prices or to further decrease or limit their crude oil production; • armed conflict in the Arabian Gulf and West Africa and political or other factors; and • the development, availability and the costs of nuclear power, natural gas, coal and other alternative sources of energy. In addition, volatile economic conditions affecting world economies may result in reduced consumption of oil products and a decreased demand for our vessels and lower charter rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and our ability to pay dividends. “ I don’t really know how to evaluate these so I will let you evaluate them. They also say that “If the tanker industry, which historically has been cyclical and volatile, declines in the future, our revenues, earnings and available cash flow may be adversely affected.“ which basically means the earnings might go up or they might go down. The same is with the stock price. Personally I think they will do well at least the next year because the demand for oil is still high, China is running on all cylinders because they need more and more energy, the airlines will start having more airplanes in the sky which will kickstart refineries and until “green solutions“ kick in we will need something.

Maybe because everyone is thinking renewable energy and that oil is done.

Positions: 58 shares at 8.35$","The biggest issue with Frontline is that they're going to continue losing money at current rates, while they're in the middle of a massive expansion in the fleet that is fuelled by expensive debt. Normally when spot rates are this low and scrap prices are this high, operators with older ships will scrap them to save money, but that hasn't happened yet, to the confusion of all.If spot rates increase Frontline will make a fortune. If they do not, they will rapidly approach bankruptcy as they have in years past. Price/Book is a useless measure in this case because of the massive spreads present when valuing and trading shipping assets. Every other shipping company that exists has a P/B > 1 but shareholders still lose everything when they go bankrupt, and tanker companies go bankrupt a lot.With all of that said, they're so leveraged that an increase in rates could yield ludicrous profits, as we saw near the start of Covid. Two primary drivers to keep watch of are changes to the soon-to-be ratified EEXI, and tanker spot rates. Frontline has a much newer and more efficient fleet than most, are are well positioned relative to their competition, but they're taking on a huge amount of risk with their debt and exposure to spot pricing.",0,0.533,0.99,NEGATIVE
