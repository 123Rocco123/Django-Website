Now, back in the day the accountants and lawyers in London didn't give a fuck as long as they got their commision for the M&A. But the economic dynamics of Britain are changing since Brexit.If governments refuse to protect and promote succesful companies, especially a crown jewel like ARM, then the public will send them the way of the Whig Party.In summary, this deal will be blocked, because if it isn't, the Conservatives will be out of power for the next few decades. People are still furious the original buyout by Softbank wasn't blocked. And yes, the mechanism exists, they used it to stop the Saudi's from buying out BAE Systems.",3,0.526,0.995,NEGATIVE
