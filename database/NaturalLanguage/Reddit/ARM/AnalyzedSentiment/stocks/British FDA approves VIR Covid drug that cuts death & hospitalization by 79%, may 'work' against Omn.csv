,"New drug Sotrovimab is approved by MHRA (British version of FDA) for 12 and over with mild-to-moderate Covid who is at risk of developing serious illness. It is a drug developed in partnership by VIR biotechnology ($VIR) and GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK). VIR CEO: ""Sotrovimab was deliberately designed with a mutating virus in mind. By targeting a highly conserved region of the spike protein that is less likely to mutate, we hoped to address both the current Sars-CoV-2 virus and future variants that we expected would be inevitable"" MHRA: ""It is too early to know whether the Omicron variant has any impact on sotrovimab's effectiveness but the MHRA will work with the company to establish this."" VIR & GSK say early tests show the drug ""retains activity against key mutations of the new Omicron variant."" The drug is a 30 minute treatment. I say ""may work against Omicron"" because it really depends on what $VIR means by ""retains activity."" That sounds like a technical term so if anyone here is a medical researcher who knows what that means please chime in. Is $VIR an investment opportunity? The bull case: Obviously if it works vs Omicron it may blow up. It's already up 14% today. Even before today's news US has already ordered $1 billion worth of this drug in mid November. It is already authorized for emergency use in US. EU approval is pending (not sure about EU). $VIR claims this therapy may also work as a shot in the arm Is $VIR worth investing in? The Bear case: Why did it go up as high $83 in January? Why is it down in the dumps at $50 right now? What happened. $VIR is a one-trick pony. Unlike Moderna which has lots of other things in its pipeline. This therapy sounds promising, but if Pfizer delivers their drug (which promises 89% and can be taken at home) and it also works against Omicron then would $VIR be anything special? Is it possible that both $VIR and $PFE are worth investing in because there's going to be a huge roadblock in production so they won't really be competing against each other? I'm trading Pfizer and VIR but not sure what to do here.","WTF does ""may work""? suppose to mean?We still haven't had a single death from Omicron. So what's up with this bs headline.Is the media, pharmaceutical companies and FDA this broken that they have to pump non-news?""May work""Does doing nothing count as a ""may work"" as well?

Greg Abbott. Monoclonal antibody therapy is one of a handful of treatments with emergency use approval from the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of COVID-19. Currently, it’s only available to high-risk patients with a doctor’s referral. According to the FDA — “Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made proteins that mimic the immune system’s ability to fight off harmful antigens such as viruses. Sotrovimab is a monoclonal antibody that is specifically directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and is designed to block the virus’ attachment and entry into human cells.”",4,0.509,0.993,NEGATIVE
