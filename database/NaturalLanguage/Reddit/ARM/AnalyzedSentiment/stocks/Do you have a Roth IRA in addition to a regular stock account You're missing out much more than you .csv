,"I'm thinking that a good number of you have a Roth IRA, and you're taking advantage of what a Roth IRA provides an investor/trader. Basically, it works like this. Do you think you'll be alive when you're 60 years old? (Yes?/No?). If you think you'll be alive, do you think you'd like to be able to withdraw money and profits $$$ from a Roth IRA that's completely dodged Uncle Sam's greedy tax collecting arms? (Yes?/No?) If both answers are yes, you should have a Roth IRA. PERIOD. I don't care if you're 21 years old, 35 years old, or 58 years old. You should probably have a Roth IRA. Now, the big question of course is.... ""What are the big downsides to having a Roth IRA?"" The biggest downside, is that you're unable to withdraw any profits without incurring a tax penalty, until you're 59 1/2 years old. Key word here is profits. It's a myth that you can't withdraw anything from a Roth IRA. Once you've owned the Roth IRA a certain number of years, you're allowed to withdraw your contributions. You just can't also withdraw the winnings. They have to stay in the account until you're 59 1/2. What if I have an emergency and need the money? You can get your money out, but you'll just have to pay taxes on it, and there might be some other penalties associated with it. How much money do I need to have a Roth IRA? I'm pretty sure you can open one up with a very small amount of money. However, there is something that you'll need to be aware of. You can only contribute a certain amount of money per year. So you couldn't open a Roth IRA right now with 50k. If you have a 50k in your bank, that you'd like to put in a Roth IRA, you're out of luck. Instead, you have to start making yearly contributions. That's why it's important to start this process earlier rather than later. I believe you're limited to a maximum of 6k contribution per year, unless you're 50 years or older. At the age of 50, you're able to contribute 7k per year. I think the biggest struggle for people with Roth IRA's is that people think that they're putting their money away into a prison, and that money is going to be locked up until they're old and brittle and can't enjoy it any damn way. I was talking to my 18 year old son about a Roth IRA, and he just doesn't want to hear anything about it. For him, it's 41 years into the future before you can withdraw anything.... but THIS ISN'T TRUE. You can't withdraw profits. But at a certain point, you can withdraw contributions if you really got desperate. The way that I like to explain a Roth IRA to somebody, is to consider a bucket of water. Imagine that the Roth IRA is water at the very bottom of the bucket. You're mostly using the water at the top of the bucket, to occasionally scoop out a cup of water. The water at the bottom of the bucket just remains there, and it's still a part of the whole equation, but it's not being used. It's probably just going to stay at the very bottom of the bucket. That's your Roth IRA. So, if you're 35 years old right now, and somehow you got an inheritance of 100k, and you don't have a Roth IRA yet, you'd be foolish not to take 6k from that 100k and open up a Roth IRA. Take another 6k, and put it into the same Roth IRA in early January. So, you can contribute 12k of that 100k into a Roth IRA in the next 40 days. 6k for 2021 and 6k for 2022. Now, you as a 35 year old, might be thinking.... ""But I don't want to mess with that 100k. I don't want to remove 12k of it for some dumb Roth IRA that I'm not going to use for 30 something years"". But remember the water at the bottom of the bucket. Your 100k is still intact. It's still being 100 percent invested. It's just the 12k that went into your Roth IRA is at the very bottom of the bucket. Are you planning on spending ever last penny of your stock investing portfolio? No? You're always going to have some money in your stock market portfolio? Ok, then just consider this 12k that went into your Roth the very bottom of the bucket. Because in 24 1/2 years, you're going to thank your lucky stars that you did this. Also, come January 2023, you want to throw another 6k in that puppy. You can daytrade and swing trade and do any crazy things you want to do with it inside the Roth IRA, because it never creates any taxable events! Also, if you get super desperate, cause you lost your job, and you need money bad... You can at least withdraw your contributions with zero penalties (after a certain time period). So you can't really lose. Just do it. Even if you can only contribute 1k per year... DO IT. NOTE: Your Annual Income needs to be under 140k per year to contribute to a Roth IRA for that year.",Another benefit of the Roth is that you are contributing funds that have already been taxed at today's tax rate.

,"I'm thinking that a good number of you have a Roth IRA, and you're taking advantage of what a Roth IRA provides an investor/trader. Basically, it works like this. Do you think you'll be alive when you're 60 years old? (Yes?/No?). If you think you'll be alive, do you think you'd like to be able to withdraw money and profits $$$ from a Roth IRA that's completely dodged Uncle Sam's greedy tax collecting arms? (Yes?/No?) If both answers are yes, you should have a Roth IRA. PERIOD. I don't care if you're 21 years old, 35 years old, or 58 years old. You should probably have a Roth IRA. Now, the big question of course is.... ""What are the big downsides to having a Roth IRA?"" The biggest downside, is that you're unable to withdraw any profits without incurring a tax penalty, until you're 59 1/2 years old. Key word here is profits. It's a myth that you can't withdraw anything from a Roth IRA. Once you've owned the Roth IRA a certain number of years, you're allowed to withdraw your contributions. You just can't also withdraw the winnings. They have to stay in the account until you're 59 1/2. What if I have an emergency and need the money? You can get your money out, but you'll just have to pay taxes on it, and there might be some other penalties associated with it. How much money do I need to have a Roth IRA? I'm pretty sure you can open one up with a very small amount of money. However, there is something that you'll need to be aware of. You can only contribute a certain amount of money per year. So you couldn't open a Roth IRA right now with 50k. If you have a 50k in your bank, that you'd like to put in a Roth IRA, you're out of luck. Instead, you have to start making yearly contributions. That's why it's important to start this process earlier rather than later. I believe you're limited to a maximum of 6k contribution per year, unless you're 50 years or older. At the age of 50, you're able to contribute 7k per year. I think the biggest struggle for people with Roth IRA's is that people think that they're putting their money away into a prison, and that money is going to be locked up until they're old and brittle and can't enjoy it any damn way. I was talking to my 18 year old son about a Roth IRA, and he just doesn't want to hear anything about it. For him, it's 41 years into the future before you can withdraw anything.... but THIS ISN'T TRUE. You can't withdraw profits. But at a certain point, you can withdraw contributions if you really got desperate. The way that I like to explain a Roth IRA to somebody, is to consider a bucket of water. Imagine that the Roth IRA is water at the very bottom of the bucket. You're mostly using the water at the top of the bucket, to occasionally scoop out a cup of water. The water at the bottom of the bucket just remains there, and it's still a part of the whole equation, but it's not being used. It's probably just going to stay at the very bottom of the bucket. That's your Roth IRA. So, if you're 35 years old right now, and somehow you got an inheritance of 100k, and you don't have a Roth IRA yet, you'd be foolish not to take 6k from that 100k and open up a Roth IRA. Take another 6k, and put it into the same Roth IRA in early January. So, you can contribute 12k of that 100k into a Roth IRA in the next 40 days. 6k for 2021 and 6k for 2022. Now, you as a 35 year old, might be thinking.... ""But I don't want to mess with that 100k. I don't want to remove 12k of it for some dumb Roth IRA that I'm not going to use for 30 something years"". But remember the water at the bottom of the bucket. Your 100k is still intact. It's still being 100 percent invested. It's just the 12k that went into your Roth IRA is at the very bottom of the bucket. Are you planning on spending ever last penny of your stock investing portfolio? No? You're always going to have some money in your stock market portfolio? Ok, then just consider this 12k that went into your Roth the very bottom of the bucket. Because in 24 1/2 years, you're going to thank your lucky stars that you did this. Also, come January 2023, you want to throw another 6k in that puppy. You can daytrade and swing trade and do any crazy things you want to do with it inside the Roth IRA, because it never creates any taxable events! Also, if you get super desperate, cause you lost your job, and you need money bad... You can at least withdraw your contributions with zero penalties (after a certain time period).

If you think you'll be alive, do you think you'd like to be able to withdraw money and profits $$$ from a Roth IRA that's completely dodged Uncle Sam's greedy tax collecting arms? (Yes?/No?) If both answers are yes, you should have a Roth IRA. PERIOD. I don't care if you're 21 years old, 35 years old, or 58 years old. You should probably have a Roth IRA. Now, the big question of course is.... ""What are the big downsides to having a Roth IRA?"" The biggest downside, is that you're unable to withdraw any profits without incurring a tax penalty, until you're 59 1/2 years old. Key word here is profits. It's a myth that you can't withdraw anything from a Roth IRA. Once you've owned the Roth IRA a certain number of years, you're allowed to withdraw your contributions. You just can't also withdraw the winnings. They have to stay in the account until you're 59 1/2. What if I have an emergency and need the money? You can get your money out, but you'll just have to pay taxes on it, and there might be some other penalties associated with it. How much money do I need to have a Roth IRA? I'm pretty sure you can open one up with a very small amount of money. However, there is something that you'll need to be aware of. You can only contribute a certain amount of money per year. So you couldn't open a Roth IRA right now with 50k. If you have a 50k in your bank, that you'd like to put in a Roth IRA, you're out of luck. Instead, you have to start making yearly contributions. That's why it's important to start this process earlier rather than later. I believe you're limited to a maximum of 6k contribution per year, unless you're 50 years or older. At the age of 50, you're able to contribute 7k per year. I think the biggest struggle for people with Roth IRA's is that people think that they're putting their money away into a prison, and that money is going to be locked up until they're old and brittle and can't enjoy it any damn way. I was talking to my 18 year old son about a Roth IRA, and he just doesn't want to hear anything about it. For him, it's 41 years into the future before you can withdraw anything.... but THIS ISN'T TRUE. You can't withdraw profits. But at a certain point, you can withdraw contributions if you really got desperate. The way that I like to explain a Roth IRA to somebody, is to consider a bucket of water. Imagine that the Roth IRA is water at the very bottom of the bucket. You're mostly using the water at the top of the bucket, to occasionally scoop out a cup of water. The water at the bottom of the bucket just remains there, and it's still a part of the whole equation, but it's not being used. It's probably just going to stay at the very bottom of the bucket. That's your Roth IRA. So, if you're 35 years old right now, and somehow you got an inheritance of 100k, and you don't have a Roth IRA yet, you'd be foolish not to take 6k from that 100k and open up a Roth IRA. Take another 6k, and put it into the same Roth IRA in early January. So, you can contribute 12k of that 100k into a Roth IRA in the next 40 days. 6k for 2021 and 6k for 2022. Now, you as a 35 year old, might be thinking.... ""But I don't want to mess with that 100k. I don't want to remove 12k of it for some dumb Roth IRA that I'm not going to use for 30 something years"". But remember the water at the bottom of the bucket. Your 100k is still intact. It's still being 100 percent invested. It's just the 12k that went into your Roth IRA is at the very bottom of the bucket. Are you planning on spending ever last penny of your stock investing portfolio? No? You're always going to have some money in your stock market portfolio? Ok, then just consider this 12k that went into your Roth the very bottom of the bucket. Because in 24 1/2 years, you're going to thank your lucky stars that you did this. Also, come January 2023, you want to throw another 6k in that puppy. You can daytrade and swing trade and do any crazy things you want to do with it inside the Roth IRA, because it never creates any taxable events! Also, if you get super desperate, cause you lost your job, and you need money bad... You can at least withdraw your contributions with zero penalties (after a certain time period). So you can't really lose. Just do it. Even if you can only contribute 1k per year... DO IT.

They could increase sales taxes and lower income taxes for example, making a Roth a bad investment now.Another possibility is maybe in the future there will be a basic income since lots of jobs could get automated and income taxes could be reduced to 0 to incentivize work for those who want to live on more than the basic income.That's why it's prudent to diversify with taxes and have both Roth and traditional accounts. I personally contribute only to Roth because company matches to Roth 401k are considered traditional so if you have a Roth 401k you're already diversified. Your contributions are post-tax but the company's are pre-tax.",1,0.549,0.999,NEGATIVE
,"I'm thinking that a good number of you have a Roth IRA, and you're taking advantage of what a Roth IRA provides an investor/trader. Basically, it works like this. Do you think you'll be alive when you're 60 years old? (Yes?/No?). If you think you'll be alive, do you think you'd like to be able to withdraw money and profits $$$ from a Roth IRA that's completely dodged Uncle Sam's greedy tax collecting arms? (Yes?/No?) If both answers are yes, you should have a Roth IRA. PERIOD. I don't care if you're 21 years old, 35 years old, or 58 years old. You should probably have a Roth IRA. Now, the big question of course is.... ""What are the big downsides to having a Roth IRA?"" The biggest downside, is that you're unable to withdraw any profits without incurring a tax penalty, until you're 59 1/2 years old. Key word here is profits. It's a myth that you can't withdraw anything from a Roth IRA. Once you've owned the Roth IRA a certain number of years, you're allowed to withdraw your contributions. You just can't also withdraw the winnings. They have to stay in the account until you're 59 1/2. What if I have an emergency and need the money? You can get your money out, but you'll just have to pay taxes on it, and there might be some other penalties associated with it. How much money do I need to have a Roth IRA? I'm pretty sure you can open one up with a very small amount of money. However, there is something that you'll need to be aware of. You can only contribute a certain amount of money per year. So you couldn't open a Roth IRA right now with 50k. If you have a 50k in your bank, that you'd like to put in a Roth IRA, you're out of luck. Instead, you have to start making yearly contributions. That's why it's important to start this process earlier rather than later. I believe you're limited to a maximum of 6k contribution per year, unless you're 50 years or older. At the age of 50, you're able to contribute 7k per year. I think the biggest struggle for people with Roth IRA's is that people think that they're putting their money away into a prison, and that money is going to be locked up until they're old and brittle and can't enjoy it any damn way. I was talking to my 18 year old son about a Roth IRA, and he just doesn't want to hear anything about it. For him, it's 41 years into the future before you can withdraw anything.... but THIS ISN'T TRUE. You can't withdraw profits. But at a certain point, you can withdraw contributions if you really got desperate. The way that I like to explain a Roth IRA to somebody, is to consider a bucket of water. Imagine that the Roth IRA is water at the very bottom of the bucket. You're mostly using the water at the top of the bucket, to occasionally scoop out a cup of water. The water at the bottom of the bucket just remains there, and it's still a part of the whole equation, but it's not being used. It's probably just going to stay at the very bottom of the bucket. That's your Roth IRA. So, if you're 35 years old right now, and somehow you got an inheritance of 100k, and you don't have a Roth IRA yet, you'd be foolish not to take 6k from that 100k and open up a Roth IRA. Take another 6k, and put it into the same Roth IRA in early January. So, you can contribute 12k of that 100k into a Roth IRA in the next 40 days. 6k for 2021 and 6k for 2022. Now, you as a 35 year old, might be thinking.... ""But I don't want to mess with that 100k. I don't want to remove 12k of it for some dumb Roth IRA that I'm not going to use for 30 something years"". But remember the water at the bottom of the bucket. Your 100k is still intact. It's still being 100 percent invested. It's just the 12k that went into your Roth IRA is at the very bottom of the bucket. Are you planning on spending ever last penny of your stock investing portfolio? No? You're always going to have some money in your stock market portfolio? Ok, then just consider this 12k that went into your Roth the very bottom of the bucket. Because in 24 1/2 years, you're going to thank your lucky stars that you did this. Also, come January 2023, you want to throw another 6k in that puppy. You can daytrade and swing trade and do any crazy things you want to do with it inside the Roth IRA, because it never creates any taxable events! Also, if you get super desperate, cause you lost your job, and you need money bad... You can at least withdraw your contributions with zero penalties (after a certain time period). So you can't really lose. Just do it. Even if you can only contribute 1k per year... DO IT. NOTE: Your Annual Income needs to be under 140k per year to contribute to a Roth IRA for that year.","If the 6k was from your employer's 401k she was correct to say it should roll into a traditional IRA. Otherwise you would have to pay income taxes on it plus an additional 10% penalty. The advantage of the traditional being you don't have to pay income taxes on your contributions.The advantage of the Roth IRA is that the money you contribute has already been taxed as income. So at age 59-1/2 you can withdraw it tax free.

Take another 6k, and put it into the same Roth IRA in early January. So, you can contribute 12k of that 100k into a Roth IRA in the next 40 days. 6k for 2021 and 6k for 2022. Now, you as a 35 year old, might be thinking.... ""But I don't want to mess with that 100k. I don't want to remove 12k of it for some dumb Roth IRA that I'm not going to use for 30 something years"". But remember the water at the bottom of the bucket. Your 100k is still intact. It's still being 100 percent invested. It's just the 12k that went into your Roth IRA is at the very bottom of the bucket. Are you planning on spending ever last penny of your stock investing portfolio? No? You're always going to have some money in your stock market portfolio? Ok, then just consider this 12k that went into your Roth the very bottom of the bucket. Because in 24 1/2 years, you're going to thank your lucky stars that you did this. Also, come January 2023, you want to throw another 6k in that puppy. You can daytrade and swing trade and do any crazy things you want to do with it inside the Roth IRA, because it never creates any taxable events! Also, if you get super desperate, cause you lost your job, and you need money bad... You can at least withdraw your contributions with zero penalties (after a certain time period). So you can't really lose. Just do it. Even if you can only contribute 1k per year... DO IT. NOTE: Your Annual Income needs to be under 140k per year to contribute to a Roth IRA for that year.","Every once in a great while the US government gives the little guy a true break. The Roth IRA is one of the greatest annual gifts we receive. If used properly, you put money in, it grows tax free, and you take it out tax free.Another really good gift is the 529 plan.

,"I'm thinking that a good number of you have a Roth IRA, and you're taking advantage of what a Roth IRA provides an investor/trader. Basically, it works like this. Do you think you'll be alive when you're 60 years old? (Yes?/No?). If you think you'll be alive, do you think you'd like to be able to withdraw money and profits $$$ from a Roth IRA that's completely dodged Uncle Sam's greedy tax collecting arms? (Yes?/No?) If both answers are yes, you should have a Roth IRA. PERIOD. I don't care if you're 21 years old, 35 years old, or 58 years old. You should probably have a Roth IRA. Now, the big question of course is.... ""What are the big downsides to having a Roth IRA?"" The biggest downside, is that you're unable to withdraw any profits without incurring a tax penalty, until you're 59 1/2 years old. Key word here is profits. It's a myth that you can't withdraw anything from a Roth IRA. Once you've owned the Roth IRA a certain number of years, you're allowed to withdraw your contributions. You just can't also withdraw the winnings. They have to stay in the account until you're 59 1/2. What if I have an emergency and need the money? You can get your money out, but you'll just have to pay taxes on it, and there might be some other penalties associated with it. How much money do I need to have a Roth IRA? I'm pretty sure you can open one up with a very small amount of money. However, there is something that you'll need to be aware of. You can only contribute a certain amount of money per year. So you couldn't open a Roth IRA right now with 50k. If you have a 50k in your bank, that you'd like to put in a Roth IRA, you're out of luck. Instead, you have to start making yearly contributions. That's why it's important to start this process earlier rather than later. I believe you're limited to a maximum of 6k contribution per year, unless you're 50 years or older. At the age of 50, you're able to contribute 7k per year. I think the biggest struggle for people with Roth IRA's is that people think that they're putting their money away into a prison, and that money is going to be locked up until they're old and brittle and can't enjoy it any damn way. I was talking to my 18 year old son about a Roth IRA, and he just doesn't want to hear anything about it. For him, it's 41 years into the future before you can withdraw anything.... but THIS ISN'T TRUE. You can't withdraw profits. But at a certain point, you can withdraw contributions if you really got desperate. The way that I like to explain a Roth IRA to somebody, is to consider a bucket of water. Imagine that the Roth IRA is water at the very bottom of the bucket. You're mostly using the water at the top of the bucket, to occasionally scoop out a cup of water. The water at the bottom of the bucket just remains there, and it's still a part of the whole equation, but it's not being used. It's probably just going to stay at the very bottom of the bucket.

But at a certain point, you can withdraw contributions if you really got desperate. The way that I like to explain a Roth IRA to somebody, is to consider a bucket of water. Imagine that the Roth IRA is water at the very bottom of the bucket. You're mostly using the water at the top of the bucket, to occasionally scoop out a cup of water. The water at the bottom of the bucket just remains there, and it's still a part of the whole equation, but it's not being used. It's probably just going to stay at the very bottom of the bucket. That's your Roth IRA. So, if you're 35 years old right now, and somehow you got an inheritance of 100k, and you don't have a Roth IRA yet, you'd be foolish not to take 6k from that 100k and open up a Roth IRA. Take another 6k, and put it into the same Roth IRA in early January. So, you can contribute 12k of that 100k into a Roth IRA in the next 40 days. 6k for 2021 and 6k for 2022. Now, you as a 35 year old, might be thinking.... ""But I don't want to mess with that 100k. I don't want to remove 12k of it for some dumb Roth IRA that I'm not going to use for 30 something years"". But remember the water at the bottom of the bucket. Your 100k is still intact. It's still being 100 percent invested. It's just the 12k that went into your Roth IRA is at the very bottom of the bucket. Are you planning on spending ever last penny of your stock investing portfolio? No? You're always going to have some money in your stock market portfolio? Ok, then just consider this 12k that went into your Roth the very bottom of the bucket. Because in 24 1/2 years, you're going to thank your lucky stars that you did this. Also, come January 2023, you want to throw another 6k in that puppy. You can daytrade and swing trade and do any crazy things you want to do with it inside the Roth IRA, because it never creates any taxable events! Also, if you get super desperate, cause you lost your job, and you need money bad... You can at least withdraw your contributions with zero penalties (after a certain time period). So you can't really lose. Just do it. Even if you can only contribute 1k per year... DO IT.

Now, the big question of course is.... ""What are the big downsides to having a Roth IRA?"" The biggest downside, is that you're unable to withdraw any profits without incurring a tax penalty, until you're 59 1/2 years old. Key word here is profits. It's a myth that you can't withdraw anything from a Roth IRA. Once you've owned the Roth IRA a certain number of years, you're allowed to withdraw your contributions. You just can't also withdraw the winnings. They have to stay in the account until you're 59 1/2. What if I have an emergency and need the money? You can get your money out, but you'll just have to pay taxes on it, and there might be some other penalties associated with it. How much money do I need to have a Roth IRA? I'm pretty sure you can open one up with a very small amount of money. However, there is something that you'll need to be aware of. You can only contribute a certain amount of money per year. So you couldn't open a Roth IRA right now with 50k. If you have a 50k in your bank, that you'd like to put in a Roth IRA, you're out of luck. Instead, you have to start making yearly contributions. That's why it's important to start this process earlier rather than later. I believe you're limited to a maximum of 6k contribution per year, unless you're 50 years or older. At the age of 50, you're able to contribute 7k per year.

I think the biggest struggle for people with Roth IRA's is that people think that they're putting their money away into a prison, and that money is going to be locked up until they're old and brittle and can't enjoy it any damn way. I was talking to my 18 year old son about a Roth IRA, and he just doesn't want to hear anything about it. For him, it's 41 years into the future before you can withdraw anything.... but THIS ISN'T TRUE. You can't withdraw profits. But at a certain point, you can withdraw contributions if you really got desperate. The way that I like to explain a Roth IRA to somebody, is to consider a bucket of water. Imagine that the Roth IRA is water at the very bottom of the bucket. You're mostly using the water at the top of the bucket, to occasionally scoop out a cup of water. The water at the bottom of the bucket just remains there, and it's still a part of the whole equation, but it's not being used. It's probably just going to stay at the very bottom of the bucket. That's your Roth IRA. So, if you're 35 years old right now, and somehow you got an inheritance of 100k, and you don't have a Roth IRA yet, you'd be foolish not to take 6k from that 100k and open up a Roth IRA. Take another 6k, and put it into the same Roth IRA in early January. So, you can contribute 12k of that 100k into a Roth IRA in the next 40 days. 6k for 2021 and 6k for 2022. Now, you as a 35 year old, might be thinking.... ""But I don't want to mess with that 100k. I don't want to remove 12k of it for some dumb Roth IRA that I'm not going to use for 30 something years"". But remember the water at the bottom of the bucket. Your 100k is still intact. It's still being 100 percent invested. It's just the 12k that went into your Roth IRA is at the very bottom of the bucket. Are you planning on spending ever last penny of your stock investing portfolio? No? You're always going to have some money in your stock market portfolio? Ok, then just consider this 12k that went into your Roth the very bottom of the bucket. Because in 24 1/2 years, you're going to thank your lucky stars that you did this. Also, come January 2023, you want to throw another 6k in that puppy. You can daytrade and swing trade and do any crazy things you want to do with it inside the Roth IRA, because it never creates any taxable events! Also, if you get super desperate, cause you lost your job, and you need money bad... You can at least withdraw your contributions with zero penalties (after a certain time period). So you can't really lose. Just do it. Even if you can only contribute 1k per year... DO IT. NOTE: Your Annual Income needs to be under 140k per year to contribute to a Roth IRA for that year.","You can actually withdraw the entire balance, contributions and earnings, in an emergency without penalty or tax as long as it is deposited back with 60 days.

Do you think you'll be alive when you're 60 years old? (Yes?/No?).

The biggest downside, is that you're unable to withdraw any profits without incurring a tax penalty, until you're 59 1/2 years old. Key word here is profits. It's a myth that you can't withdraw anything from a Roth IRA. Once you've owned the Roth IRA a certain number of years, you're allowed to withdraw your contributions. You just can't also withdraw the winnings. They have to stay in the account until you're 59 1/2. What if I have an emergency and need the money? You can get your money out, but you'll just have to pay taxes on it, and there might be some other penalties associated with it. How much money do I need to have a Roth IRA? I'm pretty sure you can open one up with a very small amount of money. However, there is something that you'll need to be aware of. You can only contribute a certain amount of money per year. So you couldn't open a Roth IRA right now with 50k. If you have a 50k in your bank, that you'd like to put in a Roth IRA, you're out of luck. Instead, you have to start making yearly contributions.

Invited him over for dinner and he did a finailcal analysis on my wife and I. Was really informative. Got me all signed up for an IRA a term and perm life insurance policy, the works.He opened a door for me and when I walked through I realized his shitty brokerage was charging me upwards of 6% admin fees.I have since switched the Traditional IRA at his firm to my own Roth at Vanguard. Let's see. Compounded interest of 6% at his firm or the 0.1% I'm paying at Vangaurd (and for much better options). I also dropped the term he signed me up for in exchange for a premium repayment term plan, so I'll be getting a $15k check if I make it to 50 yrs. The perm plan was the only good thing I held onto.Since then I also got my brother switched from EdJones to Vanguard.

So you couldn't open a Roth IRA right now with 50k. If you have a 50k in your bank, that you'd like to put in a Roth IRA, you're out of luck. Instead, you have to start making yearly contributions. That's why it's important to start this process earlier rather than later. I believe you're limited to a maximum of 6k contribution per year, unless you're 50 years or older. At the age of 50, you're able to contribute 7k per year. I think the biggest struggle for people with Roth IRA's is that people think that they're putting their money away into a prison, and that money is going to be locked up until they're old and brittle and can't enjoy it any damn way. I was talking to my 18 year old son about a Roth IRA, and he just doesn't want to hear anything about it. For him, it's 41 years into the future before you can withdraw anything.... but THIS ISN'T TRUE. You can't withdraw profits. But at a certain point, you can withdraw contributions if you really got desperate. The way that I like to explain a Roth IRA to somebody, is to consider a bucket of water. Imagine that the Roth IRA is water at the very bottom of the bucket. You're mostly using the water at the top of the bucket, to occasionally scoop out a cup of water. The water at the bottom of the bucket just remains there, and it's still a part of the whole equation, but it's not being used. It's probably just going to stay at the very bottom of the bucket. That's your Roth IRA. So, if you're 35 years old right now, and somehow you got an inheritance of 100k, and you don't have a Roth IRA yet, you'd be foolish not to take 6k from that 100k and open up a Roth IRA. Take another 6k, and put it into the same Roth IRA in early January. So, you can contribute 12k of that 100k into a Roth IRA in the next 40 days. 6k for 2021 and 6k for 2022. Now, you as a 35 year old, might be thinking.... ""But I don't want to mess with that 100k. I don't want to remove 12k of it for some dumb Roth IRA that I'm not going to use for 30 something years"". But remember the water at the bottom of the bucket. Your 100k is still intact. It's still being 100 percent invested. It's just the 12k that went into your Roth IRA is at the very bottom of the bucket. Are you planning on spending ever last penny of your stock investing portfolio? No? You're always going to have some money in your stock market portfolio? Ok, then just consider this 12k that went into your Roth the very bottom of the bucket. Because in 24 1/2 years, you're going to thank your lucky stars that you did this. Also, come January 2023, you want to throw another 6k in that puppy. You can daytrade and swing trade and do any crazy things you want to do with it inside the Roth IRA, because it never creates any taxable events! Also, if you get super desperate, cause you lost your job, and you need money bad... You can at least withdraw your contributions with zero penalties (after a certain time period). So you can't really lose. Just do it. Even if you can only contribute 1k per year... DO IT.

The biggest downside, is that you're unable to withdraw any profits without incurring a tax penalty, until you're 59 1/2 years old. Key word here is profits. It's a myth that you can't withdraw anything from a Roth IRA. Once you've owned the Roth IRA a certain number of years, you're allowed to withdraw your contributions. You just can't also withdraw the winnings. They have to stay in the account until you're 59 1/2. What if I have an emergency and need the money? You can get your money out, but you'll just have to pay taxes on it, and there might be some other penalties associated with it. How much money do I need to have a Roth IRA? I'm pretty sure you can open one up with a very small amount of money. However, there is something that you'll need to be aware of. You can only contribute a certain amount of money per year. So you couldn't open a Roth IRA right now with 50k. If you have a 50k in your bank, that you'd like to put in a Roth IRA, you're out of luck. Instead, you have to start making yearly contributions. That's why it's important to start this process earlier rather than later. I believe you're limited to a maximum of 6k contribution per year, unless you're 50 years or older. At the age of 50, you're able to contribute 7k per year. I think the biggest struggle for people with Roth IRA's is that people think that they're putting their money away into a prison, and that money is going to be locked up until they're old and brittle and can't enjoy it any damn way. I was talking to my 18 year old son about a Roth IRA, and he just doesn't want to hear anything about it. For him, it's 41 years into the future before you can withdraw anything.... but THIS ISN'T TRUE. You can't withdraw profits. But at a certain point, you can withdraw contributions if you really got desperate. The way that I like to explain a Roth IRA to somebody, is to consider a bucket of water. Imagine that the Roth IRA is water at the very bottom of the bucket. You're mostly using the water at the top of the bucket, to occasionally scoop out a cup of water. The water at the bottom of the bucket just remains there, and it's still a part of the whole equation, but it's not being used. It's probably just going to stay at the very bottom of the bucket. That's your Roth IRA. So, if you're 35 years old right now, and somehow you got an inheritance of 100k, and you don't have a Roth IRA yet, you'd be foolish not to take 6k from that 100k and open up a Roth IRA. Take another 6k, and put it into the same Roth IRA in early January. So, you can contribute 12k of that 100k into a Roth IRA in the next 40 days. 6k for 2021 and 6k for 2022. Now, you as a 35 year old, might be thinking.... ""But I don't want to mess with that 100k. I don't want to remove 12k of it for some dumb Roth IRA that I'm not going to use for 30 something years"". But remember the water at the bottom of the bucket. Your 100k is still intact. It's still being 100 percent invested. It's just the 12k that went into your Roth IRA is at the very bottom of the bucket. Are you planning on spending ever last penny of your stock investing portfolio? No? You're always going to have some money in your stock market portfolio? Ok, then just consider this 12k that went into your Roth the very bottom of the bucket. Because in 24 1/2 years, you're going to thank your lucky stars that you did this. Also, come January 2023, you want to throw another 6k in that puppy. You can daytrade and swing trade and do any crazy things you want to do with it inside the Roth IRA, because it never creates any taxable events! Also, if you get super desperate, cause you lost your job, and you need money bad... You can at least withdraw your contributions with zero penalties (after a certain time period). So you can't really lose. Just do it. Even if you can only contribute 1k per year... DO IT. NOTE: Your Annual Income needs to be under 140k per year to contribute to a Roth IRA for that year.","Been using Fidelity since 2017. I love it.

It's a myth that you can't withdraw anything from a Roth IRA. Once you've owned the Roth IRA a certain number of years, you're allowed to withdraw your contributions. You just can't also withdraw the winnings. They have to stay in the account until you're 59 1/2. What if I have an emergency and need the money? You can get your money out, but you'll just have to pay taxes on it, and there might be some other penalties associated with it. How much money do I need to have a Roth IRA? I'm pretty sure you can open one up with a very small amount of money. However, there is something that you'll need to be aware of. You can only contribute a certain amount of money per year. So you couldn't open a Roth IRA right now with 50k. If you have a 50k in your bank, that you'd like to put in a Roth IRA, you're out of luck. Instead, you have to start making yearly contributions. That's why it's important to start this process earlier rather than later. I believe you're limited to a maximum of 6k contribution per year, unless you're 50 years or older. At the age of 50, you're able to contribute 7k per year. I think the biggest struggle for people with Roth IRA's is that people think that they're putting their money away into a prison, and that money is going to be locked up until they're old and brittle and can't enjoy it any damn way. I was talking to my 18 year old son about a Roth IRA, and he just doesn't want to hear anything about it. For him, it's 41 years into the future before you can withdraw anything.... but THIS ISN'T TRUE. You can't withdraw profits. But at a certain point, you can withdraw contributions if you really got desperate. The way that I like to explain a Roth IRA to somebody, is to consider a bucket of water. Imagine that the Roth IRA is water at the very bottom of the bucket. You're mostly using the water at the top of the bucket, to occasionally scoop out a cup of water. The water at the bottom of the bucket just remains there, and it's still a part of the whole equation, but it's not being used. It's probably just going to stay at the very bottom of the bucket. That's your Roth IRA. So, if you're 35 years old right now, and somehow you got an inheritance of 100k, and you don't have a Roth IRA yet, you'd be foolish not to take 6k from that 100k and open up a Roth IRA. Take another 6k, and put it into the same Roth IRA in early January. So, you can contribute 12k of that 100k into a Roth IRA in the next 40 days. 6k for 2021 and 6k for 2022. Now, you as a 35 year old, might be thinking.... ""But I don't want to mess with that 100k. I don't want to remove 12k of it for some dumb Roth IRA that I'm not going to use for 30 something years"". But remember the water at the bottom of the bucket. Your 100k is still intact. It's still being 100 percent invested. It's just the 12k that went into your Roth IRA is at the very bottom of the bucket. Are you planning on spending ever last penny of your stock investing portfolio? No? You're always going to have some money in your stock market portfolio? Ok, then just consider this 12k that went into your Roth the very bottom of the bucket. Because in 24 1/2 years, you're going to thank your lucky stars that you did this. Also, come January 2023, you want to throw another 6k in that puppy. You can daytrade and swing trade and do any crazy things you want to do with it inside the Roth IRA, because it never creates any taxable events! Also, if you get super desperate, cause you lost your job, and you need money bad... You can at least withdraw your contributions with zero penalties (after a certain time period). So you can't really lose. Just do it. Even if you can only contribute 1k per year... DO IT. NOTE: Your Annual Income needs to be under 140k per year to contribute to a Roth IRA for that year.","I still do swing trades in my Roth as well, so I keep track of profits and contributions as well.",1,0.53,0.995,POSITIVE

If both answers are yes, you should have a Roth IRA. PERIOD. I don't care if you're 21 years old, 35 years old, or 58 years old. You should probably have a Roth IRA. Now, the big question of course is.... ""What are the big downsides to having a Roth IRA?"" The biggest downside, is that you're unable to withdraw any profits without incurring a tax penalty, until you're 59 1/2 years old. Key word here is profits. It's a myth that you can't withdraw anything from a Roth IRA. Once you've owned the Roth IRA a certain number of years, you're allowed to withdraw your contributions. You just can't also withdraw the winnings. They have to stay in the account until you're 59 1/2. What if I have an emergency and need the money? You can get your money out, but you'll just have to pay taxes on it, and there might be some other penalties associated with it. How much money do I need to have a Roth IRA? I'm pretty sure you can open one up with a very small amount of money. However, there is something that you'll need to be aware of. You can only contribute a certain amount of money per year. So you couldn't open a Roth IRA right now with 50k. If you have a 50k in your bank, that you'd like to put in a Roth IRA, you're out of luck. Instead, you have to start making yearly contributions. That's why it's important to start this process earlier rather than later. I believe you're limited to a maximum of 6k contribution per year, unless you're 50 years or older. At the age of 50, you're able to contribute 7k per year. I think the biggest struggle for people with Roth IRA's is that people think that they're putting their money away into a prison, and that money is going to be locked up until they're old and brittle and can't enjoy it any damn way. I was talking to my 18 year old son about a Roth IRA, and he just doesn't want to hear anything about it. For him, it's 41 years into the future before you can withdraw anything.... but THIS ISN'T TRUE. You can't withdraw profits. But at a certain point, you can withdraw contributions if you really got desperate. The way that I like to explain a Roth IRA to somebody, is to consider a bucket of water. Imagine that the Roth IRA is water at the very bottom of the bucket. You're mostly using the water at the top of the bucket, to occasionally scoop out a cup of water. The water at the bottom of the bucket just remains there, and it's still a part of the whole equation, but it's not being used. It's probably just going to stay at the very bottom of the bucket. That's your Roth IRA. So, if you're 35 years old right now, and somehow you got an inheritance of 100k, and you don't have a Roth IRA yet, you'd be foolish not to take 6k from that 100k and open up a Roth IRA. Take another 6k, and put it into the same Roth IRA in early January. So, you can contribute 12k of that 100k into a Roth IRA in the next 40 days. 6k for 2021 and 6k for 2022. Now, you as a 35 year old, might be thinking.... ""But I don't want to mess with that 100k. I don't want to remove 12k of it for some dumb Roth IRA that I'm not going to use for 30 something years"". But remember the water at the bottom of the bucket. Your 100k is still intact. It's still being 100 percent invested. It's just the 12k that went into your Roth IRA is at the very bottom of the bucket. Are you planning on spending ever last penny of your stock investing portfolio? No? You're always going to have some money in your stock market portfolio? Ok, then just consider this 12k that went into your Roth the very bottom of the bucket. Because in 24 1/2 years, you're going to thank your lucky stars that you did this. Also, come January 2023, you want to throw another 6k in that puppy. You can daytrade and swing trade and do any crazy things you want to do with it inside the Roth IRA, because it never creates any taxable events! Also, if you get super desperate, cause you lost your job, and you need money bad... You can at least withdraw your contributions with zero penalties (after a certain time period). So you can't really lose. Just do it. Even if you can only contribute 1k per year... DO IT. NOTE: Your Annual Income needs to be under 140k per year to contribute to a Roth IRA for that year.","Okay thanks! Yeah, it’s not something that I think I’d do often - but I was thinking that if I wanted to lock in gains on a certain stock, and then it dipped to a new attractive buy-in price I’d want to be able to buy back in without worrying about wash sales or short term gains or whatever.

,"I'm thinking that a good number of you have a Roth IRA, and you're taking advantage of what a Roth IRA provides an investor/trader. Basically, it works like this. Do you think you'll be alive when you're 60 years old? (Yes?/No?). If you think you'll be alive, do you think you'd like to be able to withdraw money and profits $$$ from a Roth IRA that's completely dodged Uncle Sam's greedy tax collecting arms? (Yes?/No?) If both answers are yes, you should have a Roth IRA. PERIOD. I don't care if you're 21 years old, 35 years old, or 58 years old. You should probably have a Roth IRA. Now, the big question of course is.... ""What are the big downsides to having a Roth IRA?"" The biggest downside, is that you're unable to withdraw any profits without incurring a tax penalty, until you're 59 1/2 years old. Key word here is profits. It's a myth that you can't withdraw anything from a Roth IRA. Once you've owned the Roth IRA a certain number of years, you're allowed to withdraw your contributions. You just can't also withdraw the winnings. They have to stay in the account until you're 59 1/2. What if I have an emergency and need the money? You can get your money out, but you'll just have to pay taxes on it, and there might be some other penalties associated with it. How much money do I need to have a Roth IRA? I'm pretty sure you can open one up with a very small amount of money. However, there is something that you'll need to be aware of. You can only contribute a certain amount of money per year. So you couldn't open a Roth IRA right now with 50k. If you have a 50k in your bank, that you'd like to put in a Roth IRA, you're out of luck. Instead, you have to start making yearly contributions. That's why it's important to start this process earlier rather than later. I believe you're limited to a maximum of 6k contribution per year, unless you're 50 years or older. At the age of 50, you're able to contribute 7k per year. I think the biggest struggle for people with Roth IRA's is that people think that they're putting their money away into a prison, and that money is going to be locked up until they're old and brittle and can't enjoy it any damn way. I was talking to my 18 year old son about a Roth IRA, and he just doesn't want to hear anything about it. For him, it's 41 years into the future before you can withdraw anything.... but THIS ISN'T TRUE. You can't withdraw profits. But at a certain point, you can withdraw contributions if you really got desperate. The way that I like to explain a Roth IRA to somebody, is to consider a bucket of water. Imagine that the Roth IRA is water at the very bottom of the bucket. You're mostly using the water at the top of the bucket, to occasionally scoop out a cup of water. The water at the bottom of the bucket just remains there, and it's still a part of the whole equation, but it's not being used. It's probably just going to stay at the very bottom of the bucket. That's your Roth IRA. So, if you're 35 years old right now, and somehow you got an inheritance of 100k, and you don't have a Roth IRA yet, you'd be foolish not to take 6k from that 100k and open up a Roth IRA. Take another 6k, and put it into the same Roth IRA in early January. So, you can contribute 12k of that 100k into a Roth IRA in the next 40 days. 6k for 2021 and 6k for 2022. Now, you as a 35 year old, might be thinking.... ""But I don't want to mess with that 100k. I don't want to remove 12k of it for some dumb Roth IRA that I'm not going to use for 30 something years"". But remember the water at the bottom of the bucket. Your 100k is still intact. It's still being 100 percent invested. It's just the 12k that went into your Roth IRA is at the very bottom of the bucket. Are you planning on spending ever last penny of your stock investing portfolio? No? You're always going to have some money in your stock market portfolio? Ok, then just consider this 12k that went into your Roth the very bottom of the bucket. Because in 24 1/2 years, you're going to thank your lucky stars that you did this. Also, come January 2023, you want to throw another 6k in that puppy.

,"I'm thinking that a good number of you have a Roth IRA, and you're taking advantage of what a Roth IRA provides an investor/trader. Basically, it works like this. Do you think you'll be alive when you're 60 years old? (Yes?/No?). If you think you'll be alive, do you think you'd like to be able to withdraw money and profits $$$ from a Roth IRA that's completely dodged Uncle Sam's greedy tax collecting arms? (Yes?/No?) If both answers are yes, you should have a Roth IRA. PERIOD. I don't care if you're 21 years old, 35 years old, or 58 years old. You should probably have a Roth IRA. Now, the big question of course is.... ""What are the big downsides to having a Roth IRA?"" The biggest downside, is that you're unable to withdraw any profits without incurring a tax penalty, until you're 59 1/2 years old. Key word here is profits. It's a myth that you can't withdraw anything from a Roth IRA. Once you've owned the Roth IRA a certain number of years, you're allowed to withdraw your contributions. You just can't also withdraw the winnings. They have to stay in the account until you're 59 1/2. What if I have an emergency and need the money? You can get your money out, but you'll just have to pay taxes on it, and there might be some other penalties associated with it. How much money do I need to have a Roth IRA? I'm pretty sure you can open one up with a very small amount of money. However, there is something that you'll need to be aware of. You can only contribute a certain amount of money per year. So you couldn't open a Roth IRA right now with 50k. If you have a 50k in your bank, that you'd like to put in a Roth IRA, you're out of luck. Instead, you have to start making yearly contributions. That's why it's important to start this process earlier rather than later. I believe you're limited to a maximum of 6k contribution per year, unless you're 50 years or older. At the age of 50, you're able to contribute 7k per year. I think the biggest struggle for people with Roth IRA's is that people think that they're putting their money away into a prison, and that money is going to be locked up until they're old and brittle and can't enjoy it any damn way. I was talking to my 18 year old son about a Roth IRA, and he just doesn't want to hear anything about it. For him, it's 41 years into the future before you can withdraw anything.... but THIS ISN'T TRUE. You can't withdraw profits. But at a certain point, you can withdraw contributions if you really got desperate. The way that I like to explain a Roth IRA to somebody, is to consider a bucket of water. Imagine that the Roth IRA is water at the very bottom of the bucket. You're mostly using the water at the top of the bucket, to occasionally scoop out a cup of water. The water at the bottom of the bucket just remains there, and it's still a part of the whole equation, but it's not being used. It's probably just going to stay at the very bottom of the bucket. That's your Roth IRA. So, if you're 35 years old right now, and somehow you got an inheritance of 100k, and you don't have a Roth IRA yet, you'd be foolish not to take 6k from that 100k and open up a Roth IRA. Take another 6k, and put it into the same Roth IRA in early January. So, you can contribute 12k of that 100k into a Roth IRA in the next 40 days. 6k for 2021 and 6k for 2022. Now, you as a 35 year old, might be thinking.... ""But I don't want to mess with that 100k. I don't want to remove 12k of it for some dumb Roth IRA that I'm not going to use for 30 something years"". But remember the water at the bottom of the bucket. Your 100k is still intact. It's still being 100 percent invested. It's just the 12k that went into your Roth IRA is at the very bottom of the bucket. Are you planning on spending ever last penny of your stock investing portfolio? No? You're always going to have some money in your stock market portfolio? Ok, then just consider this 12k that went into your Roth the very bottom of the bucket.

That's your Roth IRA. So, if you're 35 years old right now, and somehow you got an inheritance of 100k, and you don't have a Roth IRA yet, you'd be foolish not to take 6k from that 100k and open up a Roth IRA. Take another 6k, and put it into the same Roth IRA in early January. So, you can contribute 12k of that 100k into a Roth IRA in the next 40 days. 6k for 2021 and 6k for 2022. Now, you as a 35 year old, might be thinking.... ""But I don't want to mess with that 100k. I don't want to remove 12k of it for some dumb Roth IRA that I'm not going to use for 30 something years"". But remember the water at the bottom of the bucket. Your 100k is still intact. It's still being 100 percent invested. It's just the 12k that went into your Roth IRA is at the very bottom of the bucket. Are you planning on spending ever last penny of your stock investing portfolio? No? You're always going to have some money in your stock market portfolio? Ok, then just consider this 12k that went into your Roth the very bottom of the bucket. Because in 24 1/2 years, you're going to thank your lucky stars that you did this. Also, come January 2023, you want to throw another 6k in that puppy. You can daytrade and swing trade and do any crazy things you want to do with it inside the Roth IRA, because it never creates any taxable events! Also, if you get super desperate, cause you lost your job, and you need money bad... You can at least withdraw your contributions with zero penalties (after a certain time period). So you can't really lose. Just do it. Even if you can only contribute 1k per year... DO IT. NOTE: Your Annual Income needs to be under 140k per year to contribute to a Roth IRA for that year.",Ok thank you for the advice. I will definitely look into that a little more.

,"I'm thinking that a good number of you have a Roth IRA, and you're taking advantage of what a Roth IRA provides an investor/trader. Basically, it works like this. Do you think you'll be alive when you're 60 years old? (Yes?/No?). If you think you'll be alive, do you think you'd like to be able to withdraw money and profits $$$ from a Roth IRA that's completely dodged Uncle Sam's greedy tax collecting arms? (Yes?/No?) If both answers are yes, you should have a Roth IRA. PERIOD. I don't care if you're 21 years old, 35 years old, or 58 years old. You should probably have a Roth IRA. Now, the big question of course is.... ""What are the big downsides to having a Roth IRA?"" The biggest downside, is that you're unable to withdraw any profits without incurring a tax penalty, until you're 59 1/2 years old. Key word here is profits. It's a myth that you can't withdraw anything from a Roth IRA. Once you've owned the Roth IRA a certain number of years, you're allowed to withdraw your contributions. You just can't also withdraw the winnings. They have to stay in the account until you're 59 1/2. What if I have an emergency and need the money? You can get your money out, but you'll just have to pay taxes on it, and there might be some other penalties associated with it. How much money do I need to have a Roth IRA? I'm pretty sure you can open one up with a very small amount of money. However, there is something that you'll need to be aware of. You can only contribute a certain amount of money per year. So you couldn't open a Roth IRA right now with 50k. If you have a 50k in your bank, that you'd like to put in a Roth IRA, you're out of luck. Instead, you have to start making yearly contributions. That's why it's important to start this process earlier rather than later. I believe you're limited to a maximum of 6k contribution per year, unless you're 50 years or older. At the age of 50, you're able to contribute 7k per year. I think the biggest struggle for people with Roth IRA's is that people think that they're putting their money away into a prison, and that money is going to be locked up until they're old and brittle and can't enjoy it any damn way. I was talking to my 18 year old son about a Roth IRA, and he just doesn't want to hear anything about it. For him, it's 41 years into the future before you can withdraw anything.... but THIS ISN'T TRUE. You can't withdraw profits. But at a certain point, you can withdraw contributions if you really got desperate. The way that I like to explain a Roth IRA to somebody, is to consider a bucket of water.
