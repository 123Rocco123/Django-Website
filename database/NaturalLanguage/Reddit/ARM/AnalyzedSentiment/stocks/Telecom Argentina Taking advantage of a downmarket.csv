,"Like Ana Steele’s arms, the country of Argentina has been in a bind. The country owes $323 billion, defaulting a year ago (for the third time in the previous twenty years). This is the ninth time that the country has defaulted. The debt on Argentina, along with high inflation, can be similar to the United States in 1973 and 1980. In both years, the U.S. faced high debt ($458 billion in 1973 and $908 billion in 1980). In both years, inflation went up (look at the gas prices in both years). This caused stock prices for U.S. stocks to plummet. However, men such as Warren Buffett took advantage of these price discrepancies and invested and made money. Buffett invested in the Washington Post and shares of GEICO. Telecom Argentina (TEO) has gone down by 36.82 percent in the past year, TEO has $220.38 million in cash. The market values TEO at $693 million as of April 2nd. The company has $4.5 billion in book value, mainly due to the $3 billion in Goodwill and $4.03 billion in Property, plant and equipment. Let us assume that the company removes the Goodwill. The company still has $1.5 billion in equity, meaning that the company is selling at just half its’ book value. Despite the COVID-19 mess, the company has lost less money than last year ($80.85 million in 2020 vs. $89.99 million in 2019). Yes, the EBIT is smaller ($419 million in 2020 vs. $558 million in 2019); but, if we multiply the EBIT by ten, the company would worth $4.19 billion, whereas the current market value is $693.38 million. The intrinsic value of this company (in my view) will be at least five times its’ current worth. The margin-of-safety might not be realized today; but, it will eventually (most likely).",You can’t seriously compare Argentina to the US,0,0.518,0.954,POSITIVE
