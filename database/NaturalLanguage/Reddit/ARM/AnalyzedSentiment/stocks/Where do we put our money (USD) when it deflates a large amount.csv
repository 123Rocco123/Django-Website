In my mind there should be a civil war rn, Thinking UVXY calls then BTC","You mean to protect against inflation? Real assets. Too little data to know how crypto reacts during an inflationary period to be sure it will be a safe haven. As of the data so far, crypto functions in a similar way to a high risk asset, so rate hikes will likely move BTC downwards.Fed also does not control the market. Money printing actually help saved the economy from crashing back when covid first initially hit so it’s not necessarily bad. I couldn’t imagine where the world would be if we had to shut down the economy with no stimulus.Most people accept to work for $10/hr because there are no other options. Rather than looking to protect your wealth (or gambling into stocks, options and other assets to hopefully get rich - like many do) when you’re working $10/hr you should probably look to invest it in yourself by means of advancing your education or skills to get a better job. I’m not trying to sound condescending in any way, but it is the truth, you cannot expect to save for a better future working $10/hr / the minimum wage.",0,0.519,0.96,NEGATIVE

It is unfair that the FED can do whatever they want with our money supply and manipulate rates to be near 0% (making money almost free for wallstreet).In this case, what your going to want to do is consider, do you want to get out of the $USD system? This would require leaving the USA and choosing another fiat currency. Your more than welcome to leave. keep in mind the $USD is currently the worlds #1 reserve currency. (This will not last forever though).If you dont want to leave the $USD , the only other safe option is to invest in stuff like real estate or stocks or gold.

In my mind there should be a civil war rn, Thinking UVXY calls then BTC","Buy real assets like stocks or real estate or gold/silver. There's a reason there's an extremely high correlation between the stock market and the size of the Fed's balance sheet. Don't hold stuff that's denominated in dollars like bonds, and obviously don't hold cash, unless it's with the purpose of buying a market dip.You're certainly right that the end of the road is coming, and the USD will lose reserve currency status this decade. Anyone can look up previous reserve currency statuses of countries and they have flipped many times with no country holding it longer than 110 years. Last holder was Great Britain from 1815-1920. USA took over after that. Nothing is certain, but there is very high likelihood that we lose it by 2030 and maybe even 2025 with the way budget deficits and money printing continue to happen.Real assets are the only way to preserve your wealth and protect against inflation.
