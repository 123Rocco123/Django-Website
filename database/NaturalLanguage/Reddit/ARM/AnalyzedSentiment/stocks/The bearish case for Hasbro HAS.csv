,"So as an adult with a small child, I have some biased here. These observations are just from my perspective, and I welcome discussion. The TLDR is that Hasbro is ready for a sharp decline in which the company shows no signs of recovering. My argument is that both arms of the company are in for a deep decline, likely due to improper monetization. As a toy company, the number one thing your toys need to be is fun. Hasbro lags in consumer trends and focuses primarily on physical entertainment (toys, cards, books) rather than virtual (video, media, etc.). The effects of a post covid environment, cheap electronics, and poor decision-making will cause the company to contract. Physical Toys and dolls are the first half of their revenue stream. The two major carriers seem to be Nerf guns and dolls/action figures. Currently, there is an excess of unsold inventory. This leads to an increase in price for sold inventory to make up for the difference. This shows that Hasbro toys are both falling out of trend and becoming uncompetitive. https://www.wsj.com/articles/hasbro-has-q3-earnings-report-2022-11666105768. In perhaps one of the biggest letdowns to my inner child, Toys R' Us closed its stores. I can't help but notice that one of the major reasons we didn't go there was that we could download new entertainment. I can't help but notice a trend for digital copies of products. Roblox and Minecraft seem to be replacing lego.

The TTRPG industry's dissatisfaction with WTOC has been building due to the declining quality of their released content. I have felt this and am starting to look at my bookshelf without the same rosy affection I used to. Anyway, those are my thoughts. Please let me know what you all think in the comments below.","HAS milking MTG players dry with way too many sets per year is why legacy players have walked away from the game and now just stick to secondary market singles and older formats.HAS updating the OGL to further milk DnD is also alienating the fanbase of one of their biggest IPs.I got out of their stock at a break even (with dividends) since theyâ€™ve turned into a company that is, under current management, very anti-consumer (much like Disney over the past few years).",0,0.559,1.0,NEGATIVE

Could it draw in a crowd amid casual gamers? Could they spin a cinematic universe from it? Not saying this could save the company in the long run but could lead to a temporary spike in the stock that could hurt shorting parties.",0,0.564,1.0,NEGATIVE
