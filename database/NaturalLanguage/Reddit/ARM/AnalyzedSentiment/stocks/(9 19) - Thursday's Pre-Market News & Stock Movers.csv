,"Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Thursday, September the 19th, 2024- Dow futures jump 500 points in delayed reaction to Fed’s big rate cut: Live updates U.S. stock futures climbed higher Thursday as traders digested the Federal Reserve’s Wednesday decision to lower interest rates by a half percentage point. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 522 points, or 1.3%. The Dow closed Wednesday lower in the immediate aftermath of the Fed’s announcement. Futures tied to the S&P 500 climbed 1.7%, while Nasdaq 100 futures added 2.2%. The Fed slashed its overnight lending rate to a range of 4.75% to 5% from 5.25% to 5.5% on Wednesday, which came as a surprise to some investors who criticized the size of this initial cut. This is the first rate reduction delivered by the Fed in four years. Tech stocks rallied in premarket as the rate cut spurred investors to return to a risk-on mood. Nvidia and AMD shares popped more than 3% each. Micron Technology traded more than 2% higher. Other big tech stocks such as Meta and Alphabet climbed more than 2% higher. Stocks leveraged to lower rates spurring the economy also jumped Thursday morning. Financial giant JPMorgan Chase rose 1.3%. Industrial stock Caterpillar and Home Depot advanced around 2% each. “This was the best news I’ve heard from the Fed in years,” Jeremy Siegel, professor emeritus at University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Thursday regarding the 50bps interest rate cut. “This is fantastic news for the market, and great news for the economy.” After seesawing for most of Wednesday afternoon, stocks ultimately closed the session lower. Both the S&P 500 and 30-stock Dow initially rallied to new record highs right after the Fed announced its interest rate cut decision. STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: (CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!)
