It is in their proprietary CUDA software which is the gold standard for running AI/ML code only on Nvidia GPUs and has a near monopoly for that field.

Just wondering because Cuda has been around for a long time and it’s always been great but I don’t think it had anything to do with ai so I’m wondering if it’s just a coincidence that AI is so good with cuda or if it was expected.,3,0.549,NEGATIVE,0.998

Nvidia was lagging in the market and he decided to put all the company's eggs in the software for GPU computing market. Luckily for him, the scientific community, the crypto community and then the ML communities developed Python libraries for number crunching using GPUs because those acted as coprocessors and did not bog the CPU down.Nvidia paid attention to their needs and went out of their way to serve those markets while others were focused on the much bigger gaming markets.Then OpenAI happened and rest is history.",4,0.543,NEGATIVE,0.999

Billions of devices are sold each year carrying their technology and they seemingly collect a few cents per device or so, not even a dollar Am I missing something?","Nvidias advantage is definitely partially in hardware, the reason however is not as simple as ""no one else is offering competitive hardware"", but rather the network effect created by the immense popularity of PyTorch in the ML community and its reliance on over ~2200 unique operators that tensor and CUDA cores natively support, and that number is constantly growing, everyone else is just playing catch up, if they find the incentive to focus on it that is. the talent level required to train a massive model with high FLOPS utilization on a GPU grows increasingly higher because of all the tricks needed to extract maximum performance.the only way to break the vicious cycle is for the software that runs models on Nvidia GPUs to transfer seamlessly to other hardware with as little effort as possible. as model architectures stabilize and abstractions from PyTorch 2.0, OpenAI Triton, and MLOps firms such as MosaicML become the default, the architecture and economics of the chip solution starts to become the biggest driver of the purchase rather than the ease of use afforded to it by Nvidia’s superior software",4,0.516,NEGATIVE,0.79

If they start charging more, the industry will move onto a different architecture. In fact, it's much easier to do this now than ever before. Once most software had made the transition to supporting ARM32 and ARM64 from x86 and x64, it's now just a matter essentially of recompiling to a different architecture. MIPS may make a comeback if people start leaving ARM. Apple has shown how easily they switched from PowerPC to Intel to ARM.

They're both reduced instruction set CPUS.

There are an awful lot of ARM processors that target a really low price point.If ARM were to just raise the prices for their mid-tier and top-tier offerings, SOCs would probably use the older designs to avoid paying the increased licensing fees unless it was raised across the board. We'd see an awful lot of devices putting 8x Cortex A53s into devices again, which is something we've seen in the past. (The Cortex A53 is efficient, but it's also slower than a turtle on benadryl. About as fast as a well-clocked Pentium 3.)I could see it working much better on the Cortex X series, and maybe also the A710, A720, etc. It would be a marginal increase for the manufacturers at the price point that these devices target, and they are less likely to just downgrade because of an extra dollar or two in licensing costs.",3,0.531,NEGATIVE,1.0

I could definitely see them losing market share though, both because ARM real technological advantage is less and because increasing price might signal further increases (especially if staggered like you suggest).",4,0.533,NEGATIVE,0.999

The majority of an SOC is generally stuff other than the CPU cores anyway.The majority of SOCs do pretty much just straight up use ARM's designs though.
