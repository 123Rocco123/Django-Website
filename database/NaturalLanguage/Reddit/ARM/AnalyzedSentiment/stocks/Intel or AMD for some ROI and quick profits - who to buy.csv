,"Intel is coming big with Mobileye; eyeing the Autonomous Vehicle market and going IPO. They've made the early move to Big/Little chip design which should give them a slight edge over AMD for being the fist to get there. That said; AMD is coming with Big/Little and v cache on next gen. I'm also betting they get into Autonomous Vehicles and a possible ARM design and new tech in order to compete with Intel and nvidia. I don't see how AMD stays competitive without entering a new market. I'm thinking that Intel is a buy up to 70 dollars for new investors, and hold and see for new tech and partnerships or purchasing agreements. I'd bet they hit 90 - 100 by this time next year, and possibly a bit more, but this assumes that Nvidia is not able to buy ARM. What are your thoughts?",Bull case for INTC reminds me of the bull case for VIAC. The rev and PE look like they're both undervalued yet the market just doesn't like them. I think the market perceives them as being left in the dust by the competition. Hard to know if that sentiment will change and when.I'm long AMD,0,0.555,0.994,NEGATIVE

What are your thoughts?","Its P/E is over 10 now, with up to 30% declining revenues in the next year and who knows what will happen after that.I wouldn't call it 'cheap' unless the mega fans bring back a lot of revenue. Which is not something to take for granted.",2,0.549,1.0,NEGATIVE

The chip they designed is two generations ahead of intel. Apple has their own AI and ML, software integration to go with the chip. We don’t know what their business model is, and any partnerships with auto makers.",0,0.549,0.988,NEGATIVE
