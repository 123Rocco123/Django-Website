The Chinese entity, which is usually owned by top executives, pays fees and royalties to the offshore company in contractual arrangements.The biggest example of a VIE is Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., in which the Chinese entity is wholly owned by its founder and chairman, Jack Ma.The risk with this setup is that foreign investors don’t actually own stock in the company, and local management or even the Chinese government could decide or force a split with the listed company, leaving U.S. investors high and dry.",4,0.556,0.998,NEGATIVE

(NYSE:NIO), (LI) - Nio Looks To Expand EV Charging Infrastructure In Partnership With Germany's Metro | Benzinga","See my reply above. Tesla vehicles lose resale value because it's tied to the battery. With battery swap capabilities this is not true for nio, and customers can rent new batteries as they become available. Not to mention that Nio can cut the initial cost of ownership by allowing customers to rent the battery as opposed to buy it (BaaS or Battery as a Service scheme). Even as an investor, I shared the same fear as you that swap stations prevented more problems than they solved... But they will still be offering charging too. And the more I researched it, the more I believed it's actually very clever",4,0.528,1.0,NEGATIVE

Why do the swaps take 10 minutes? It would be much faster than that and would be a rolling que. probably faster than a gas stationIf you wanna talk about wait times Tesla supercharging can be rly bad if they’re all full.

Having to stop and charge your car for an hour is such a day-killer, you actually have to plan and make time for that. The battery swap takes as long as it takes to fill up a tank of gas and no one is moving plans around to make time for that.

If you buy a Tesla Model Y, and 6 months later they announce an upgraded battery as standard, you cannot get this battery without buying a brand new Tesla. And because if this, as your car gets older, so does the battery, and your resale value will decay by the day, even more so than ICE vehicles. With battery swap capabilities, the value of Nio vehicle is not tied to its battery. They release a new battery with superior range and charge times? It's very easy to rent that battery instead (Nio has a BaaS, or Battery as a Service scheme where you rent the battery as opposed to buying it. Makes the initial cost of ownership much cheaper and allows you to rent any new batteries when the time comes.)So yeah, this goes much further than just the convenience of swapping for fuel.
