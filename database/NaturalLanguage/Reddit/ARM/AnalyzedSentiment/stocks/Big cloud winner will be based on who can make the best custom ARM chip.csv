,"In the past, AMD and Intel made all the server chips. There's very little to differentiate between AWS, Google Cloud, Azure except for scale and execution. They all ran the exact same Intel Xeon and AMD Epyc chips. That all changed when Amazon started prioritizing their Graviton2 ARM chip. In 2020, 50% of all new EC2 instances were based on Amazon's own CPU, not Intel or AMD. I'm willing to bet that Graviton2 grabbed even more marketshare in 2021 and now 2022. Graviton2 offers 34% better price/perf ratio than x86 chips. Amazon's own claim but it's credible. Microsoft and Google have also started designing their own custom server CPUs. It makes a lot of sense. Intel and AMD mark up their server CPUs by 10-20x the cost to manufacture them. In the past, Intel was a monopoly and Amazon, Microsoft, and Google had no choice but to pay high prices for Xeon. If AMD wins, then AMD will just replace Intel as the monopoly. Big cloud providers want to control their own destiny and not have either Intel or AMD grab them by the balls. And they want to lower cost and differentiate based on performance. They also have enough money and scale to design and manufacture their own chips. This will have profound impact on big cloud and semiconductor companies: Whoever makes the best custom ARM CPU will likely win the cloud war Right now, AWS is in the lead for custom server CPUs because they started first and is already successful with their second chip Smaller cloud companies will get smaller because they don't have the scale to design and make their own custom server chips. Rich will get richer. x86 dominant days in the server are numbered Many analysts are pricing in AMD's expected increase in server marketshares. But what they don't really understand is that big cloud providers are hellbent on avoiding another x86-monopoly. Custom ARM server chips are disrupting AMD before AMD can finish disrupting Intel. Intel, wisely, understands this. That's a primary reason they opened up their fabs to third parties. Intel wants to still manufacture Amazon, Google, Microsoft's chips. Yes, the margins are lower than selling them 10-20x marked-up chips, but at least Intel will still be in the game. TSMC will be another winner from this because these companies will bid for wafers AMD and Intel are the losers. But I expect AMD to lose more and Intel to lose less. Disclosure: I own Apple stocks, a small amount of Amazons stocks, a very small amount of Intel stocks. I'm waiting to see how Intel's manufacturing will progress before buying more or selling what I have. I'm also waiting to see how Microsoft and Google's custom CPUs perform before going all in on one of the big cloud companies. PS. Keep in mind that Wallstreet is very late to react to how chips perform. For example, it was abundantly clear that AMD's Zen2 was going to beat Intel's ass in the servers from the moment AMD announced it during CES 2019 (Jan 8 2019). Anyone with any chip knowledge knew Intel's Xeon was doomed back in 2019. But Wallstreet didn't fully react until 1+ year later. Also, it's abundantly clear that Intel's newest Alder Lake chip is going to beat AMD's ass in the consumer laptop and desktop market. But Wallstreet hasn't reacted at all.

This needs to be x86 for most software packages. While emulation can work in the future, since it is imperfect and since companies need perfect execution, this won't fly. Additionally the Apple trick won't work here and the performance will be limited. There is therefore an upper limit for bespoke ARM currently.ARM is primarily for SaaS solutions at this moment due to the issue mentioned above.AMD will not be able to replace Intel any time soon since TSMC does not have the capacity available to do so. Recent CAPEX from TSMC would indicate they won't be able to the next 5 years at least.There are pros and cons for doing everything in house. Due to Intel's execution failures the idea to do everything in house has merit. However Intel's main game is designing and manufacturing semiconductors. This means their R&D is completely focused on that, including all the patents and breakthroughs that follow. They seems to be back on track and have several technologies that could shake things up the next two years. Amazon core business is not creating processors and consequently their R&D is spread across many different departments. They might not be able to match future advancements in performance.Price/performance with Intel's current line up are skewed due to their poor past performance. There are signs that their new designs will be very competitive. Especially the integration with GPU and AI chiplet designs.Apple still has one foot in the door with Intel. It will be interesting to see if they close it completely or if they are still keeping the option open due to point 4.",0,0.534,1.0,NEGATIVE

I've been following Apple Silicon for years when it was only a rumor that they'd ditch Intel and design their own chips.Let me say this to you: Apple has both feet out the door with Intel. The only reason they still sell some Intel machines is because they haven't finished the ARM transition for all their Macs yet. That's expected to finish later this year.

A lot of corporate software for many different sectors is only written and compiled for x86. You are just naming a few open source projects. There are thousands of closed source software packages that need x86. While this might change in the future this is not what it currently is.

And if they want, I'm sure AWS will offer legacy x86.The vast majority of big cloud workloads run open source software.M1 is great but one of the main reasons is that TSMC has node superiority. Alder lake on a worse node outperforms the M1 pro by a huge margin if let loose without power constrains.Alder Lake is one node behind but worse in perf/watt by more than 3x.If Apple lets lose the M1, it'd outperform Alder Lake too. But of course perf/watt is more important on mobile.

With ARM CPUs, you buy a cheap ARM license, customize the design, but you keep the integration with the software ecosystem of ARM. With GPUs, I don't think AI workloads are well integrated and optimized for integrated GPUs you would need to use, or you would need to build your own driver stack and programming model, which would be risky and expensive. That's what Intel is pushing right now with OneAPI and they need that to have any chance in the datacenter GPU market. AMD is just trying to copy/paste as much as they can from others with HIP for the same purpose. Software wins in datacenter GPUs and that's why NVIDIA is ahead. This can obviously change in a few years with some open vendor agnostic software stack, but right now there is no ARM-like ecosystem available for high performance GPUs. I think it's more likely for cloud providers to go with ASICs or TPUs like Google, but they are usually limited in terms of parameters, so while AI algorithms designs are quickly advancing, adaptability of GPUs is very useful. This might might as well change in a few years. I think this will keep the cloud companies from investing into their own GPU software stacks, they would much rather skip it and go straight into custom hardware for the workload they have.",2,0.532,0.915,NEGATIVE

From their earnings call:Having worked with them for multiple generations, it has become apparent that the long-term opportunity is for ARM server processors customized to their specific use cases rather than the standard off-the-shelf products. The power of the ARM architecture has always been in its ability to be integrated into highly customized designs optimized for specific use cases, and we see hyperscale data center applications is no different. With our breadth of processor know-how and now our custom ASIC capability, Marvell is uniquely positioned to address this opportunity. The significant amount of unique ARM server processor IP and technology we have developed over the last few years is ideal to create the custom processors hyperscalers are requesting.Would Marvell fare well in your scenario, given that they are specializing in customized server solutions?
