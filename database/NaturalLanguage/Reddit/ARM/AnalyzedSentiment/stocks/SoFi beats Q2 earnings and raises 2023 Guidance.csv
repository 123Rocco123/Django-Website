In theory they should be more cost effective (better margins) by not having the classic brick and mortar locations. Sofi also isn't holding a bunch of long term 1-3% bonds/mortgages that many of those banks are. On the other hand, many of Sofis loans are uncollateralized which would typically be seen as much riskier in a downturn.Sofi getting their banking charter in 2022 was interesting timing because the loans they've made since have all been at much higher rates than other banks are holding. Other banks are losing deposits and they haven't been able to issue as many new loans while rates are up. Sofi on the other hand is seeing huge deposit growth and they're having no issues connecting to people looking for loans.Personally, I see them getting ~10b+ in deposits a year going forwards, depending on ad spending and such. If they can manage that while everyone else in the industry is struggling and also be profitable while growing, I don't see a better growth prospect in the market atm. Their current 30% annual revenue growth will of course slow down a bit, but I think 10 years from now will be more than enough to grow into their current valuation and some.
