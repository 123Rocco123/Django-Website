,"Just read the news PACW went through with another sale (second this week) of their real estate lending arm. It's been up double digits this week, allegedly boosted by the other sale announced early Monday, wondering if you think this will further propel the stock up? It's heavily shorted so might be a good time to hop on, what do you think will happen tomorrow? https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/pacwest-sells-real-estate-lending-unit-roc360-wsj-2023-05-24/","I love that people seem to think this is bullish. They are a sinking ship, selling off assets to keep the lights on. It's nice to see the price back up so I can ride them back down again.",0,0.51,0.991,POSITIVE

I don't think the recent rally early this week had any foundation, probably just baseless momentum after news broke out that wasn't catastrophic for once.",1,0.523,0.951,NEGATIVE

Maybe they raise some cash, but how far will it go towards steady decline in deposits? A week? A month? Two months? You always try to sell the assets you could sell, which are usually the best assets, so what are left?",0,0.536,1.0,NEGATIVE
