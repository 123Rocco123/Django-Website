,"I am short $ACY, and I think the company is worthless zero! AeroCentury Corp is the NYSE listed skeleton of a post-bankruptcy aircraft leasing company bid over by a group of “ PRC Investors” for $11M. The new owners ambition on turning their new holding company into “the” leading player in the growing GameFi/Metaverse ecosystem. In essence, the Novel Aerocentury Corp, is a reverse merger that has enabled unknown opportunistic investors access into the NYSE, one of the world’s most liquid and dynamic financial markets at a time of extreme speculative exuberance. With a Mrkt Cap of $285M, the thinly traded Aerocentury Corp has no earnings, no sales, and no operating business of note. beside its recurrent press announcement of transitioning its business strategy into the up and coming Gamefi industry within the Metaverse ecosystem, very little actionable metric can be justifiably applied to explain its current valuation. First off, what is the Gamefi? The GameFi can be interpreted as the combination of videos Games and decentralized finance. The technology used in this type of video game is blockchain; which allows players to be the sole and verified owners of the virtual elements of the game. Gamefi is built upon the play to earn model where players are able to earn money on time spent invested in the game. Gamefi is rapidly growing in popularity with large and well funded companies like Meta/Facebook tooting its futuristic and revolutionary potential. As recently as last summer, Andreessen Horowitz, one of the biggest and most storied Silicon Valley venture capital firms, invested $4.6M in a little known Philippine Gamefi company called YGG. YGG has grown to be a hugely important player in the Gamefi ecosystem. Giving the exciting opportunities presented by the Gamefi/metaverse revolution, it is obvious that hundreds of millions of dollars of investments are being poured into that ecosystem by various sized enterprises seeking to dominate it. And, dominating the Gamefi sector is Aerocentury Corp stated objective: “ We are well positioned to become the leader in the Gamefi Industry. We have a WORLD CLASS TEAM with a proven track records of success,”                         Yucheng Hu, CEO of AeroCentury Corp. Armed with a reverse merged stock shell, 8 employees, shadowy PRC based investors, the confidence displayed by Mr Hu as to the future dominant position of his company within the Gamefi industry is quite perplexing. Is his confident statement issued on the back of a proven track record in Gaming and related industries? Or, is Mr Hu a mere promoter seeking to excite the speculative crowd with boisterous statements aimed at selling his securities? Let’s investigate AeroCentury Corp “WORLD CLASS” team! -Hu YuCheng, CEO, largest shareholder. In his biograpgical presentation, Mr Hu claims to be a successful entrepreneur with over 15 years of experience in the Internet industry. He is the founder of chengdu Quleduo Technology co and has served as its CEO since 2011.  He has established the Xiyou Online Mobile game platform ( www.52xiyou.com), which is a popular online gaming platform in the PRC. My research unto Mr Hu “successful” ventures have been quite contradictory to say the least. The “Chengdu Quleduo Tech” website links into GMGC ( Global Mobile Game Confederation). The website appears inactive or dormant as its last update occurred in 2018. GMGC describes itself as a platform founded in 2012 in Beijing by David Song, a gaming entrepreneur. GMGC organizes the annual Global Mobile Gaming congress in Beijing as well as events in Kunshan and Chengdu. GMGC also host a series of conference in South East Asia and offers exclusive membership services as well. On the other hand, Quleduo Tech is listed as a private company incorporated in Hong Kong in April 2016 per Hong Kong business directory. Quleduo tech claims to be dedicated to the development of web based and smartphone video games of the highest quality. Its only attested Game is titled “ Ultra Fighters”, and it was removed from the App Store and listed on Google play by a different developer: “ Funmore Technology Company Limited.” The reviews on Ultra Fighters tend to fall within the context of: -“ Can’t connect to the updated server. Unplayable. Hasn’t been updated since 2018. Remove this from the Play store.” 1star review. 7/16/2021. -”It just won’t work instead it keeps showing a notice like cannot connect to a update server. I was looking forward to play it but i am disappointed.” 1star review 10/03/2018. Looking into www.52xiyou.com, the website heralded as a popular online gaming platform in the PRC by Mr Hu, I was intrigued by a comment made in a forum regarding the site: “It looks like a random Chinese website stealing POE ( Path of exile) gameplay footage as advertising material. The lines that appear are generic advertising like “ Great Graphics” and amazing play experience. 52xiyou.com does appears to fall well below the standards of a serious and popular gaming platform. Consequently, Mr Yucheng Hu statements regarding his long string of successful businesses are rather questionable and probably deceitful. On the other hand, he indeed appears to be more of a bombastic promoter than a real entrepreneur. It is quite unlikely that such a individual will be able to lead a company at the top of a nascent and extremely competitive industry as the GameFi. -Ms Florence Ng, VP of operation and Business development. Ms. Ng was appointed to serve as an Executive Director and VP of Operations and Business Development of the Company. Ms. Ng is a lawyer qualified in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region since 2011, specializing in international cross border mergers and acquisitions transactions and corporate commercial matters. Ms. Ng is currently an independent non-executive director of China Internet Investment Finance Holdings Limited (stock code: 810) since 2013, a company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.  China Internet Investment Finance Holding is a website-less penny stock listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. It describes itself as a public investment manager with a market cap of hk 185M. The stock is currently trading around hk1.5 with its last recorded peak price at hk3.8 in 2018. Ms Qin “ Carol” Wang: CFO,Treasurer,and secretary. Ms. Wang has been an independent financial consultant since June 202, specializing in M&A transaction for companies listed on the Nasdag and on the NYSE stock exchange. Prior to that, she served as the finance controller and financial advisor of TD Holdings, inc ( Nasdag: GLG) from february 2018 to May 2020. Through July 2016 and January 2018, she was a senior Investment manager for Yikuan Asset Management Company. TD HOLDINGS is a penny stock valued at $54M with a stock priced at $0.39. The company is engaged in the commodity trading and supply chain services in China. My research into Yikuan Asset Management were rather fruitless. My investigations into Tibbers Wong ( CEO of Meta, the Gamefi’s subsidiary) and well as Mr Raison Xiong ( CTO) were rather fruitless. According to their biographical presentations, both Mr Tibber Wong and Mr Raison Xiong “ have worked” as Gaming producer and director for Tencent Gaming studio in China. They have, allegedly, been involved in hundreds of successful gaming productions with an user base of up to 300M player with revenue over $2 Billions.No specific games titles were presented or described. Simple generalities meant to be accepted as facts. The analysis of AeroCentury Corp leadership draws a rather clear picture with regards to its stated claims of future success in the “GameFi/Metaverse”: It is all hogwash! There is nothing remotely believable about Mr Hu Yucheng’s prognostication about his company. Typical of most China’s Hustle type ventures, Aerocentury is a concoction meant on exploiting the growing ‘ Gamefi” market and excite naive Investors into buying unto its story. The $11M investment into a bankrupted Aircraft leasing company was simply meant on setting foot into the liquidity rich and speculatively euphoric NYSE.  Speculation is rampant across the entire financial economy with small investors seeking to ride the last tide of an apparent un-ending bull market. Mr Hu Yucheng and his cohorts are fully aware of the rich possibilities that a properly constructed “ lie” can yield in terms of return on invested capital in the short run. Building upon the growing metaverse and Gamefi “ play to earn” opportunity thus seem to be a perfect recipe for a quick multiple bagger profit on greedy and foolish “ Western” speculators. Do your own due diligence and analysis. I am not an investment advisor or a professional analyst.","Your analysis makes sense. I will stay away from any short or long positions. If wsb makes this into a meme somehow, it could go poorly.",0,0.518,0.992,NEGATIVE
