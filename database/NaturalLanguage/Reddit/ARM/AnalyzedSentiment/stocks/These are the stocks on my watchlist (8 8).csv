,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I only hold MAG7/market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions. Some stocks I post may be <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific questions.

News: JPMorgan Says Three Quarters of Global Carry Trades Now Unwound DT to make a news conference at 2 PM in Florida- speculation that Vance may be switched out. This is the first announcement since Walz was announced as VP pick. May position in the VIX (VXX) pre-announcement and have a tight stop. EDIT: Trump stated that there will be no changes in political strategy. Got out of VXX at flat. LUMN - Watching $8 level for today, recently reported earnings. Stock has been stronger than expected despite pullback. LLY - Reported blowout earnings- raised guidance from $13.50-$14 to $16-16.60 for 2025. EPS of $3.92 vs $2.60. Revenue of $11.3B vs $9.92. Watching how this will trade at the open but will be light because stock is so high priced. SMCI - Reported earnings two days ago, stock is still extremely weak. Will watch at open, but currently hands off for now due to high price. Other semi-related stocks/ETFs I’m watching: AMD/ARM/MU/SOXL/NVDA/NVDL. Still long NVDA. ASTS - We saw a pretty big spike yesterday, they got cleared to operate Bluebird direct-to-smartphone satellites from the FAA. ASTS needs closer to 20 satellites (and plans to launch 168). I think an offering might be imminent from the way they need to raise capital. Not sure how else they can secure additional funding at that high valuation. Will elaborate in another post.

You are throwing away potentially millions of dollars if you take on long-dated debt right now. It makes infinitely more sense to skip the middleman at that point.Yes stocks are forward looking, but the valuation that ASTS is trading at is MASSIVELY optimistic.Could I be wrong about an offering?

I can't predict the future and say ""They're going to sign a 1 billion dollar contract with SpaceX!!!"" because that's just illogical and insider trading. Offerings are significantly easier to anticipate. There is a point where an offering becomes a logical thing to do, like when GME mgmt did an offering when it was trading around $60 a few months back. Do I think the stock price is overvalued? Absolutely! Could I be wrong? Absolutely lol.i feel like you're describing a trading strategy where retail/institutions trade on news beats a ~quarter at a time and you can measure the sustainability by the multiples of the share price? is that what you do?Regarding this, that's not what I do lol. At the end of the day it's a stock I'm interested in potentially watching and I'm listing the reason for why I'm watching it. Trading is about having a bias, and that's my bias. I could go long at some point as well if my bias changes.Short from $22 btw. At the end of the day both of us can be right- they can do an offering and the market can think they're going to go higher and the price can skyrocket past that.

I am completely new to trading, so please pardon my somewhat simple questions.First, are you adding the news into your post because those things might affect your trade movements today? Naturally current events affect the stock market, but I am particularly curious about your choice to put Trump's possible VP change in bold. Do you believe that this decision would have a significant impact on the market and, if so, in what way?Where do you get the data regarding expected revenue, reported earnings, etc?Does you list of closely monitored stocks change frequently, or is this a pretty consistent grouping for you?To be honest, I don't fully understand the implications of your past job. I googled what a prop shop is, but am still curious, from your experience, what is the biggest takeaway you learned about the stock market?I appreciate you sharing you insights!",0,0.544,POSITIVE,0.818

Earnings of note: SOUN, ELF, PARA, RKLB","Hi!News absolutely matters in deciding which stocks are worth trading day to day- on an average day, a stock typically doesn't have a significant news catalyst. The ones worth trading typically (but not always) do.I believe that Trump's pick will up his chances of winning the election (in the same way that Biden stepping down upped the chance of the Democrats winning the election with Kamala). And yes, I believe that there will be some market movement as a result- DJT (the stock) could go up if his VP pick is better than Vance, there could be more volatility depending on the candidate, the VP pick could have a historical precedent of being friendly towards certain industries, etc. Worth looking at charts of the market after Biden announced he was stepping down, and after the Trump assassination attempt (which boosted Trump's chances of winning the election)The earnings reports are pretty much reported internet wide, just do a Google search and you'll be able to find it pretty quickly.I'd say it depends- the past week has been crazy so there are specific stocks that have been more interesting than others (semis, volatility, levered ETFs), but on a normal day it should change depending on what stocks have meaningful news- I post daily so you can reference my old posts in r/stocks as well.Biggest takeaway is that it is possible to beat the market, but the dedication and hard work you need to put in will genuinely be the hardest thing you do, and you need to keep putting in the effort. My mentor at the prop shop is someone I think who would have been a Michael Phelps-level Olympian if he had better physical genetics, alas he had to settle for being one of the greatest day traders in America lol. I make this watchlist daily and share it because I like to keep current with the market, because I'll never have the discipline that he does.",1,0.529,POSITIVE,0.975
