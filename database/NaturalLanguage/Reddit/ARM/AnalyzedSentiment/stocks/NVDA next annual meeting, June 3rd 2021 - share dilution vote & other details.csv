On April 7, 2021, our Board adopted resolutions approving an amendment to the Charter to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from two billion shares to four billion shares. Our Board is recommending the proposed increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock to provide adequate shares of common stock for general corporate purposes, as further described below. The Board determined that the Proposed Amendment is advisable and in the best interests of the Company and directed that the proposed Amendment be submitted for adoption and approval by stockholders at the Meeting. ... If our stockholders adopt and approve the Proposed Amendment, the Proposed Amendment will become effective on the date that it is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware ... As a general matter, the increase in our authorized but unissued shares of common stock as a result of the Proposed Amendment would enable the Board to issue additional shares of common stock in its discretion from time to time for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, expanding our business through mergers and acquisitions, including shares we would be obligated to issue in connection with the pending acquisition of Arm Limited; stock dividends and/or stock splits; providing equity incentives to employees, officers or directors; and the raising of additional capital. Such issuances would occur without further action or approval of our stockholders and would be subject to and limited by any rules or listing requirements of Nasdaq or of any other applicable rules or regulations. ... Failure by the stockholders to approve the Proposed Amendment would reduce the ability of the Board to take the potential future actions to issue additional common stock discussed above. ...

Here is how it should go in theory: company market cap = #shares * price. So if market cap is 5B and company goes and creates additional 100% shares and sells them for the current price the company gets 5B cold cash to their balance sheet. Yes, there is now twice as many shares. But in theory, the company is now 5B richer, which would make it twice more valuable.Basically, when they issue new shares and sell them for something, yes your ownership percentage goes down, but the pie (company) gets proportionally bigger so that your ""equity"" would stay the same.In practice it's never like this, since company's market cap is almost never equal to its equity. It's value is not it's equity, until you get into liquidation scenarios..EDIT: Also in practice, a lot of companies are setup in a way where they claim that their 1 share is worth 1 dollar (or 1 penny, basically a small number not tied to their actual stock in any way), so the company can in theory just add a number of shares with no additional equity and sell it to anyone they want, including their directors or owners, who now paid a minuscule sum for a large amount of shares and yeah the shareholders are left holding the bag.",2,0.571,1.0,NEGATIVE

On April 7, 2021, our Board adopted resolutions approving an amendment to the Charter to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from two billion shares to four billion shares. Our Board is recommending the proposed increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock to provide adequate shares of common stock for general corporate purposes, as further described below. The Board determined that the Proposed Amendment is advisable and in the best interests of the Company and directed that the proposed Amendment be submitted for adoption and approval by stockholders at the Meeting. ... If our stockholders adopt and approve the Proposed Amendment, the Proposed Amendment will become effective on the date that it is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware ... As a general matter, the increase in our authorized but unissued shares of common stock as a result of the Proposed Amendment would enable the Board to issue additional shares of common stock in its discretion from time to time for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, expanding our business through mergers and acquisitions, including shares we would be obligated to issue in connection with the pending acquisition of Arm Limited; stock dividends and/or stock splits; providing equity incentives to employees, officers or directors; and the raising of additional capital. Such issuances would occur without further action or approval of our stockholders and would be subject to and limited by any rules or listing requirements of Nasdaq or of any other applicable rules or regulations. ... Failure by the stockholders to approve the Proposed Amendment would reduce the ability of the Board to take the potential future actions to issue additional common stock discussed above. ...

I trust Jensen to lead the company, but why do they need to do this?With currently 2 billion shares authorised for issuance against 619M shares outstanding, we already have a possible dilution of your 1 share being worth 0.236 shares. If theyâ€™re authorised to issue another 2 billion shares, then that brings us down to 0.134x worth the value before issuance. This is an extra ~56% reduction in our share of equity on top of the possible ~76% reduction we already have.To see how this is even remotely something worth voting for, in my view, Nvidia would have to increase operating earnings/FCF by at least the same multiplier at which they dilute our shares. Simultaneously I would also like to see them maintain their high return on equity, be able to retain a larger portion of their earnings and if not return that portion in the form of buybacks and dividend payouts. Hopefully if shares are used for mergers, that management can recognise when our shares are overvalued and the business to be acquired undervalued, then mergers will be of great value for us.Taking such a possible dilution cuts your portion of wealth and ownership significantly and I, and I think many of you also, would like to see a great return for it.If the extra shares werenâ€™t included for use in executive and employee compensation I would feel a lot better about this proposal.

This is what is called a share dilution. Going further through the proxy statement document, we have the details for Proposal 4 â€” Approval of an Amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to Increase the Number of Authorized Shares of Common Stock from 2 Billion Shares to 4 Billion Shares https://i.imgur.com/6Myo5r7.png   Description of the Proposed Amendment Our Charter currently authorizes the issuance of up to two billion shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and two million shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. On April 7, 2021, our Board adopted resolutions approving an amendment to the Charter to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from two billion shares to four billion shares. Our Board is recommending the proposed increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock to provide adequate shares of common stock for general corporate purposes, as further described below. The Board determined that the Proposed Amendment is advisable and in the best interests of the Company and directed that the proposed Amendment be submitted for adoption and approval by stockholders at the Meeting. ... If our stockholders adopt and approve the Proposed Amendment, the Proposed Amendment will become effective on the date that it is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware ... As a general matter, the increase in our authorized but unissued shares of common stock as a result of the Proposed Amendment would enable the Board to issue additional shares of common stock in its discretion from time to time for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, expanding our business through mergers and acquisitions, including shares we would be obligated to issue in connection with the pending acquisition of Arm Limited; stock dividends and/or stock splits; providing equity incentives to employees, officers or directors; and the raising of additional capital. Such issuances would occur without further action or approval of our stockholders and would be subject to and limited by any rules or listing requirements of Nasdaq or of any other applicable rules or regulations. ... Failure by the stockholders to approve the Proposed Amendment would reduce the ability of the Board to take the potential future actions to issue additional common stock discussed above. ... The Board recommends that you vote FOR the approval of the Proposed Amendment to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from two billion shares to four billion shares.
