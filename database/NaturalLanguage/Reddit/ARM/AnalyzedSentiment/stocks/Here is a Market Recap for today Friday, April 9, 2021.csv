,"PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, April 9, 2021 Stocks traded higher in another record-setting session in the market. The S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow (DIA) both recorded new intraday highs and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) kept building on recent momentum. Market participants continue to digest remarks from members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The equity market got a boost after FOMC members signaled in their March meeting that the Fed continues to favor maintaining highly accommodative monetary policies for the foreseeable future and signaling they will hold off on tightening policy at the first sights of inflation. Jerome Powell reiterated that the Federal reserve was looking for “actual progress rather than forecasts” to before the Central Bank considers tightening monetary policy. Moreover, Powell highlighted the uneven recovery in the US labor market as a sign the economic recovery still has a ways to go in order to meet the Federal Reserve’s employment goals. He said “The recovery though here remains uneven and incomplete. Tee burden is still falling on lower-income workers. The unemployment rate in the bottom quartile is still 20%. There are still eight and a half million people out of work. This unevenness that we’re talking about is a very serious issue.” Treasury yields have come back down some, hovering at 1.66% at the time of writing, as fears over a near-term policy shift by the Federal Reserve dissipated, prompting market participants to rotate back to growth and mega-cap tech stocks, with Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Facebook (FB) reaching new intra-day records. Colleen MacPherson, Penobscot Investment Management portfolio manager said, “We’ve seen this rotation into more value-oriented names from growth to value, but as we enter into earnings season, we anticipate growth names to see somewhat of a rebound because we expect strong earnings coming out of the growth names. But overall, I think the trend into value, small caps, more cyclical names will continue as the economy reopens and more people are inoculated and we get back to normalcy.” Looking ahead, market participants will be closely monitoring the upcoming earnings season for the first three months (Q1) of 2021. Over the past several weeks, analysts have raised their earnings estimates by record levels with the expectation that recent economic growth will drive corporate earnings higher. According to FactSet, first-quarter earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6% over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far. Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer at Charles Schwab said, “We’re still in probably the early parts of the expansionary cyclical after recovering from that recession. We’ve started to see cyclical trades playing a big role in the early part of the cycle. Normally what happens at this stage is you continue to see … the cyclical component will continue to drive leadership into the second part of this year into next year.” Highlights Airlines suspended the use of dozens of 737 MAX jets on Friday after Boeing (BA) warned them of a possible electrical fault in the production of some planes. This is the same model of plane that had been grounded for roughly 2 years after two accidents. BlackRock and Jean-Pierre Mustier are among investors expressing interest in Credit Suisse's (CS) asset management arm, three sources told Reuters, as the Swiss bank explores options for this unit after a very high profile scandal with Archegos Capital and Bill Hwang. The White House is convening a summit with top executives at semiconductor companies to explore options regarding the global shortage. Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing is said to be raising $1.5 billion in debt financing ahead of a blockbuster U.S. IPO, Bloomberg reported Friday, citing sources familiar with the matter. The company has a reported market cap of $50 billion. **Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices** Citigroup target raised by Jefferies Financial Group from $75 to $85 at Buy.

Jerome Powell reiterated that the Federal reserve was looking for “actual progress rather than forecasts” to before the Central Bank considers tightening monetary policy. Moreover, Powell highlighted the uneven recovery in the US labor market as a sign the economic recovery still has a ways to go in order to meet the Federal Reserve’s employment goals. He said “The recovery though here remains uneven and incomplete. Tee burden is still falling on lower-income workers. The unemployment rate in the bottom quartile is still 20%. There are still eight and a half million people out of work. This unevenness that we’re talking about is a very serious issue.” Treasury yields have come back down some, hovering at 1.66% at the time of writing, as fears over a near-term policy shift by the Federal Reserve dissipated, prompting market participants to rotate back to growth and mega-cap tech stocks, with Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Facebook (FB) reaching new intra-day records. Colleen MacPherson, Penobscot Investment Management portfolio manager said, “We’ve seen this rotation into more value-oriented names from growth to value, but as we enter into earnings season, we anticipate growth names to see somewhat of a rebound because we expect strong earnings coming out of the growth names. But overall, I think the trend into value, small caps, more cyclical names will continue as the economy reopens and more people are inoculated and we get back to normalcy.” Looking ahead, market participants will be closely monitoring the upcoming earnings season for the first three months (Q1) of 2021. Over the past several weeks, analysts have raised their earnings estimates by record levels with the expectation that recent economic growth will drive corporate earnings higher. According to FactSet, first-quarter earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6% over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far. Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer at Charles Schwab said, “We’re still in probably the early parts of the expansionary cyclical after recovering from that recession. We’ve started to see cyclical trades playing a big role in the early part of the cycle. Normally what happens at this stage is you continue to see … the cyclical component will continue to drive leadership into the second part of this year into next year.” Highlights Airlines suspended the use of dozens of 737 MAX jets on Friday after Boeing (BA) warned them of a possible electrical fault in the production of some planes.
