Curious what reddit can think of in this scenario","Tough on china has always been a bipartisan issue every 4 years. Politicians don't agree on much, but they sure agree on China. Heck I would say Russia meddling in elections is way worse of an offense, but I'm sure there are a bunch of things that China is doing in the background as well.China could easily call out Trump for it's more favorable treatment of Russia (saying Russia should be invited to the next G7 meeting) even though it was Russia and not China that actively tried to sabotage our elections. But China can't do that because it would alienate their ally Russia.",0,0.537,NEGATIVE,0.996

But in the grand strategy realm they are a shriveling oil dependent state trying to recapture past glories. China has the ambition, capabilities, and the ""manifest destiny"" belief that they are destined to take the mantle from the USA.

Not to downplay Chinese atrocities but this whole blame China thing is a political play by the US. It'll die down once covid isn't a big deal anymore.The move out of China is probably because China is growing out of the manufacturing stage as a country. Wages and quality of life is increasing which means things can't be made cheaply. Makes sense for companies to start moving away from China and onto the next popular cheap labor country. China will now pivot from being a manufacturing country to something else, what that is I don't know. Don't be fooled by the current narrative.",2,0.523,NEGATIVE,1.0

Curious what reddit can think of in this scenario",Uh I am actually agreeing with you that countries will start to decouple from China on the manufacturing front. Just not for the reasons you provided.I’m just saying read between the lines. The US of A didn’t just grow a conscious and decide to punish all the bad things China is doing because it’s the right thing to do. It’s always been about money. Do you really think Apple is moving their iPhone 11 production to India to punish China? No. They’ve been planning that shit because they know cheap labor in China can’t last.Nike an all American company used Chinese child labor for decades.People want to shit on anything made in China as being low quality but forget that the iPhone and all the high end drones are made in China.Companies are absolutely moving away from China and the US will start to become less dependent on China.I’d look into emerging markets like India and Vietnam who stand to benefit from this.,4,0.53,NEGATIVE,1.0
