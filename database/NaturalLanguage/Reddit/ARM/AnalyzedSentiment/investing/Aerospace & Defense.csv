,"I'm sure a few months ago would have been the time to get into this given the enormous amount of dough Trump wants to spend on military infrastructure ... and especially with the announcement of $110b deal of arms being sold to Saudi Arabia. What are yours guys' thoughts on this sector? Vanguard only has VIS, their Industrials ETF, which has a 20% stake in aerospace & defense ... but I'm not sure where to turn beyond that. The wars are kind of winding down but they're still certainly happening, and these dealings with Saudi Arabia could possibly open the door to other deals of this magnitude.",I hate that it means I profit from war...

Like UTC also has branches like Otis for elevators. GE has/had lightbulbs. They're a bit more diversified than solely being military/defense companies. So just because wars are winding down doesn't mean the industry is going to crash. Even without wars, military deals are still made all the time to modernize equipment. The $110b deal being discussed could be a real bump to the industry in the coming years. I'd say a fund like VIS could be a good long-term play. The expense ratio is also 0.10%, which is really low. Decent yield at 1.75% too.",0,0.538,POSITIVE,0.979
