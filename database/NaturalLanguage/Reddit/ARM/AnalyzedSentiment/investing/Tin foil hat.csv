,"I have this suspicion that the only way to make money in the stock market is to ride waves. Mid term length trades, that you just get lucky on. There are some you can see coming before the big rise, but once big money gets ahold of them, they manipulate the stock so much, through articles and analyst. Computer scientist create programs that collect data from apps like Yahoo finance, or even brokerage firms that sell your user data, and they take this information and combine it to create visualization, that represents shady trends. Such as how many individual investors are interested or invested in a particular stock and at what price point they got in at, armed with this information, they have easy tools to scoop the cream of the top whenever they feel it's right to do so... Costing individual investors billions. All's it takes are some creative algorithms for that data and lack of regulations, understanding by the public. It all feels so greasy. When I start to put in a hundred grand order in and I can just watch the stock creep up in real time, then activate the order and the stock plummets immediately after my purchases at a higher price it's the have and the have nots. At that point you just have to ride the wave and jump off when you feel you've made some$. But it's just so rigged. They have so many controls that affect different types of investors, and they pay billions for it. But the return is worth it. To be able to play psychological warfare on investors to just scoop money from their accounts, counting on psychology and shady tactics to just make us puppets with their fake articles and bullshit analysis of stocks they are interested in manipulating for a very specific reason. Maybe their charts show that an abnormal amount of individual investors have invested in a stock at a price that is high, they might know how much exactly they can take from them and how much fear it will take before they crack and sell, just so they can make that money and buy back in at lower cost... It's like taking money from a baby... The men behind the curtains... They steal from us all. But it sure is fun when we get over on them lol.","I have this suspicion that the only way to make money in the stock market is to ride waves.

One unique thing about markets now is that central bankers employ every trick in the book to prevent them from falling. Literally can't go tits up (until it does in a manner that's ten times worse than had they just markets sort themselves out naturally).",0,0.529,NEGATIVE,0.989
