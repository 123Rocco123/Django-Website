,"I heard about the aerospace company Lockheed Martin last year when I read articles about the Japanese and Korean government purchasing a huge number of F-35 jets from the company. Furthermore, it was reported that Japan became the second-biggest buyer of the jet as of early 2019. Intrigued by the fact that the company was influencing the defense industry in East Asia, I decided to do some research about the company. Formed by the merger of Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta in 1995, Lockheed Martin was the third-largest aerospace company by revenues as of 2019, after Boeing and Airbus, according to Flight Global. Furthermore, it was the biggest weapons manufacturer in 2019 with arms sales of $44.9 billion, according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Not only does Lockheed Martin produce the iconic fighter jet F-35 ""Lightning II""  series, but the company also manufactures various products such as U-2 Dragon Lady, Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense(THAAD) and so on. After further research, I bought the shares of the company and am planning to keep them for the long term. Here is why. First, it is the ""biggest"" defense company from the U.S. That already says it all. Well, let me explain it better. In my country, we call the U.S. as ""Cheonjogook (roughly translated as ""The quadrillion country""),"" to refer to America spending nearly quadrillion won ($815 billion) on defense each year (Estimated U.S. military spending for the period between October 2020 and September 2012 stands at $934 billion, according to the Department of Defense. Source) In case you don't notice how big that is, $732 billion of defense budget America had in 2019 is larger than the combined spending of China ($261 billion), India ($71.1 billion), Russia ($65.1 billion), Saudi Arabia ($61.9 billion), the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th largest countries in military spending, respectively, according to data by SIPRI. In this circumstance, I don't see how the biggest defense contractor Lockheed Martin could tumble. Second, as I mentioned earlier in the intro, its foreign sales are astounding as well. It's estimated that Lockheed Martin generated $3.3 billion in South Korea alone last year as the country bought 20 additional F-35s, according to Defense News. In addition, Japan also recently inked a deal with the company to produce two Solid State Radar (SSR), according to Lockheed Martin. Considering that Japan and South Korea are injecting more and more money into defense due to surging tensions in East Asia mainly caused by China and North Korea, I believe Lockheed Martin's sales in East Asia will rise further, boosting sales of the company. (Foreign sales accounted for 21% of the company's sales in 2015.) Supporting my opinions, Lockheed Martin seems to preserve a relatively strong balance sheet even amid the coronavirus pandemic. According to the company's Q1 2020 report, its revenue rose 9.2% year over year to $15.65 billion and net sales 9% to $15.7 billion. In addition, its stock price is only down 2.74% year to date, beating the S&P 500's drop of 6.55%, as of June 1. For these reasons, I'm glad that I discovered Lockheed Martin and started investing in the company. The shares of Lockheed Martin currently trade at $388.44 as of market close on May 5.",How has someone only heard of Lockheed Martin in the last year.Hard to take any DD seriously when you lead off with that statement.,0,0.568,NEGATIVE,0.917

After further research, I bought the shares of the company and am planning to keep them for the long term. Here is why. First, it is the ""biggest"" defense company from the U.S. That already says it all. Well, let me explain it better. In my country, we call the U.S. as ""Cheonjogook (roughly translated as ""The quadrillion country""),"" to refer to America spending nearly quadrillion won ($815 billion) on defense each year (Estimated U.S. military spending for the period between October 2020 and September 2012 stands at $934 billion, according to the Department of Defense. Source) In case you don't notice how big that is, $732 billion of defense budget America had in 2019 is larger than the combined spending of China ($261 billion), India ($71.1 billion), Russia ($65.1 billion), Saudi Arabia ($61.9 billion), the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th largest countries in military spending, respectively, according to data by SIPRI. In this circumstance, I don't see how the biggest defense contractor Lockheed Martin could tumble. Second, as I mentioned earlier in the intro, its foreign sales are astounding as well. It's estimated that Lockheed Martin generated $3.3 billion in South Korea alone last year as the country bought 20 additional F-35s, according to Defense News. In addition, Japan also recently inked a deal with the company to produce two Solid State Radar (SSR), according to Lockheed Martin. Considering that Japan and South Korea are injecting more and more money into defense due to surging tensions in East Asia mainly caused by China and North Korea, I believe Lockheed Martin's sales in East Asia will rise further, boosting sales of the company. (Foreign sales accounted for 21% of the company's sales in 2015.) Supporting my opinions, Lockheed Martin seems to preserve a relatively strong balance sheet even amid the coronavirus pandemic. According to the company's Q1 2020 report, its revenue rose 9.2% year over year to $15.65 billion and net sales 9% to $15.7 billion. In addition, its stock price is only down 2.74% year to date, beating the S&P 500's drop of 6.55%, as of June 1.

,"I heard about the aerospace company Lockheed Martin last year when I read articles about the Japanese and Korean government purchasing a huge number of F-35 jets from the company. Furthermore, it was reported that Japan became the second-biggest buyer of the jet as of early 2019. Intrigued by the fact that the company was influencing the defense industry in East Asia, I decided to do some research about the company. Formed by the merger of Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta in 1995, Lockheed Martin was the third-largest aerospace company by revenues as of 2019, after Boeing and Airbus, according to Flight Global. Furthermore, it was the biggest weapons manufacturer in 2019 with arms sales of $44.9 billion, according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

After further research, I bought the shares of the company and am planning to keep them for the long term. Here is why. First, it is the ""biggest"" defense company from the U.S. That already says it all. Well, let me explain it better. In my country, we call the U.S. as ""Cheonjogook (roughly translated as ""The quadrillion country""),"" to refer to America spending nearly quadrillion won ($815 billion) on defense each year (Estimated U.S. military spending for the period between October 2020 and September 2012 stands at $934 billion, according to the Department of Defense. Source) In case you don't notice how big that is, $732 billion of defense budget America had in 2019 is larger than the combined spending of China ($261 billion), India ($71.1 billion), Russia ($65.1 billion), Saudi Arabia ($61.9 billion), the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th largest countries in military spending, respectively, according to data by SIPRI. In this circumstance, I don't see how the biggest defense contractor Lockheed Martin could tumble. Second, as I mentioned earlier in the intro, its foreign sales are astounding as well. It's estimated that Lockheed Martin generated $3.3 billion in South Korea alone last year as the country bought 20 additional F-35s, according to Defense News. In addition, Japan also recently inked a deal with the company to produce two Solid State Radar (SSR), according to Lockheed Martin. Considering that Japan and South Korea are injecting more and more money into defense due to surging tensions in East Asia mainly caused by China and North Korea, I believe Lockheed Martin's sales in East Asia will rise further, boosting sales of the company. (Foreign sales accounted for 21% of the company's sales in 2015.) Supporting my opinions, Lockheed Martin seems to preserve a relatively strong balance sheet even amid the coronavirus pandemic. According to the company's Q1 2020 report, its revenue rose 9.2% year over year to $15.65 billion and net sales 9% to $15.7 billion. In addition, its stock price is only down 2.74% year to date, beating the S&P 500's drop of 6.55%, as of June 1. For these reasons, I'm glad that I discovered Lockheed Martin and started investing in the company. The shares of Lockheed Martin currently trade at $388.44 as of market close on May 5.",,0,,,
