,It's possible that we may be entering a similar era as we are keeping small-ish grown despite keeping interst rates very low and lower rates just aren't the shot in the arm they used to be.,So stagflation in the 70s isn't really something I'd expect to see. Inflation today has been struggling to even hit target.The 70s era inflation wasn't driven by monetary availability or anything like that. There was a massive supply shock in the form of the oil embargo which caused significant cost inflation across the board despite the fact that there was very little economic growth. It would be hard to imagine a similar scenario today.,0,0.528,NEGATIVE,1.0

Almost all recessions are accompanied by deflationary pressure unless the recession was driven by some sort of supply shock - ie the 70s.It's not like you're going to have a contraction and demand driven inflation.",1,0.531,POSITIVE,0.987

,It's possible that we may be entering a similar era as we are keeping small-ish grown despite keeping interst rates very low and lower rates just aren't the shot in the arm they used to be.,I feel like there has been a quiet neo-fisher revolution going on with fed chair Jerome Powell's latest comment that inflation and interest rates' relationship has been decoupling.When rates are low that causes more investment into capital. This increased capital investment causes increased production of goods and more competition. Lower interest rates also mean lower financing costs for businesses. When production costs are lower that provides the breathing room for lower prices.Perhaps these forces have completely offset the inflation due from the increased money supply.,3,0.53,POSITIVE,0.875
,It's possible that we may be entering a similar era as we are keeping small-ish grown despite keeping interst rates very low and lower rates just aren't the shot in the arm they used to be.,"Just to tack something on here, it's obviously still possible to have currency driven inflation during recessions, but usually requires coordinated action by central banks and governments to happen. Iceland in 2008 and Argentina now being examples. Usually if things get to that point though it's the lesser of two evils and requires a pretty substantial amount of external debt. There's no reason for it happen in any major world economy in the next recession aside from maybe the UK if there's a hard brexit and things really go sideways.",3,0.512,NEGATIVE,0.962

,It's possible that we may be entering a similar era as we are keeping small-ish grown despite keeping interst rates very low and lower rates just aren't the shot in the arm they used to be.,"That's a given at this point. The whole thing is a big example of leadership failure across the board. The 'stay' campaign seems to have based their strategy around their Singapore strategy in WW2. If Boris had a bicycle the whole island might end up underwater. France and Germany are far more interested in trying to work out some kind of impact limiting deal and the EU in general picked a stupid hill to die with forcing immigration policy upon all its member states. Everyone on the leave side of things clearly has no plan at all or understanding of how damaging, expensive and time consuming it's going to be either, but they're still winning out because they seem be the only group motivated and passionate enough about their cause to pursue it with any kind of vigor.",5,0.517,NEGATIVE,1.0

,It's possible that we may be entering a similar era as we are keeping small-ish grown despite keeping interst rates very low and lower rates just aren't the shot in the arm they used to be.,"I think the 70s was driven by monetary availability. It was the birth of two income households. Between 1965 and 1984 the percentage of women in the workforce increased by 11.4%, hitting 50% of the workforce in 1978. Due to the two income households you now had more money chasing the same amount of goods. I think this was exacerbated by the oil crisis which increased frictional costs of labor and goods finding their equilibrium price.https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300002",1,0.529,NEGATIVE,0.932
