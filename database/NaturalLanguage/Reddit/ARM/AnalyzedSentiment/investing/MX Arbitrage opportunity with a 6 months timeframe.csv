,"Hi all, I've been a lurker and got some nice ideas form here, so thanks for that. Now it's the time for me to give something back. I discovered in the weekend that Magnachip is being bought up in a 29$ per share deal while the price of the stock is just 24$ per share. (https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/) The deal has a definitive agreement and ""The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of shareholder and regulatory approvals"". Also ""The transaction is fully backed by equity commitments and not contingent on any financing conditions. "" The way I see it it's a 20% win in less than 6 months (they said second half of the year, so most probably will be sometime September-October-November). The risks are small: Shareholders might oppose- but this is highly unlikely given the company is 78% own by institutions and the board of directors approves the deal. Regulatory things might kick in: this again I think it's low because we are talking about a 1 bil company, not something the size of ARM. What do you guys think? I went and put 10% of my portfolio in this, was it dumb?","The risk is that the Korean government rejects the deal because they don't want to sell critical infrastructure to Chinese investors.It's kind of funny looking at the names of the buyers, they seem to be trying very hard to not look Chinese.I'm holding MX since before the buyout, hoping that another company swoops in with a better offer in the meantime.",0,0.55,NEGATIVE,1.0

The shareholders will still have to approve the deal.I think u/totally_possible has an interesting point. OLED market has been very competitive. And there have been cases of industrial espionage between Chinese companies and South Korean companies. Regulators in South Korean may be reluctant to allow the sale to a Chinese based PE firm. But that's pure speculation on my part.I do like the risk profile though. It's been a while since I've done an m&a arbitrage trade but this one is kinda interesting.

The names of the partners are about as typical Chinese as it gets.",1,0.529,NEGATIVE,1.0

The idea is that if the merger is called off the price will drop to pre announcement levels. Essentially that's the risk, which is what the market is pricing. The market is basically paying the 20% in compensation for taking on that risk",0,0.53,NEGATIVE,1.0

Honestly the thought of turning a 20% profit is intriguing, but what do we think happens if for some reason the SK govt rejects it? Does the price take a tumble back to the low/sub 20 range?",0,0.536,POSITIVE,0.712

Based on the financials the company operating income is increasing steadily and based Justin that they would have a PE ratio of 20 approx at this time. I feel this would be a good deal even without the merger TBH.,1,0.569,POSITIVE,0.95
