From their last attempted takeover in 2018:The Navajo Nation’s plan for Remington was novel: It intended to shift the company away from its consumer business, including curtailing the sale of the AR-15-style weapons frequently used in mass shootings, to focus on police and defense contracts.The tribe planned to use profits from those businesses to invest in research and development of advanced “smart guns” — those with fingerprint or other technology intended to prevent anyone but the gun’s owner from using the weapon. Smart guns have so far failed to make much headway at the major gun manufacturers, which have faced pressure from groups like the National Rifle Association. ...The only guns the Navajo Nation planned to sell to consumers were long guns like rifles and shotguns used by hunters.“Navajo is a community of veterans and people of the land,” the tribe’s lawyer, Drew Ryce, said in an email. “We are indifferent to the AR-15 and happy to leave that business behind.”https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/16/business/dealbook/remington-sale-navajo-nation.html",2,0.532,NEGATIVE,0.999

I'm no Remington fan... Actually, I generally shy away from them. But to highlight the Bushmaster in an article geared to discuss a financial transaction as a way to swing the topic/audience of the article to a political stance is irresponsible journalism. They are the ones attempting to make a quick-buck off of emotional division. And obviously succeeding due to market ignorance.I won't turn this into a gun rights or political debate on r/investing. I'd be happy to have the debate in DM or r/guns, if you can manage to be open-minded to the idea that every AR owner isn't a ""commando wannabe"". But the fact of the matter is that the rifle they are trying to highlight as an exceptionally dangerous model than the rest of the market is just silly. There are countless semi-automatic weapons sold that are either identical to the Bushmaster (AR platform) or are not but provide the same functionality, and therefore are equally as dangerous if not used responsibly.

When Trump won, sales went way down for everyone.Gun companies anticipated continued growth under yet another Democratic president, and ramped up production. Debt-saddled Remington announced the opening of a new plant in Alabama in 2014. The National Shooting Sports Foundation shows that the gun industry overall saw an 81 percent increase in jobs between 2008 and 2016.All of this came crashing down when Donald Trump, a friend of the gun industry, took office. Speculation of future gun control subsided, buying habits slowed, and gun companies found themselves sitting on stockpiles of weapons they are unable to move as quickly as before.Pew Research Center's latest study on U.S. gun trends shows that 66 percent of gun owners own more than one gun. Some analysts conclude that dips in sales are not just tied to political fears, but the simple fact that the traditional gun purchasing demographic has exhausted itself, and gun companies are just now feeling the pressure.Here's a figure of gun sales. Sales slumped somewhat after 2016. Gun sales basically doubled after Obama was reelected, then spiked on fears of a Clinton win, then declined by 20% during Trump admin, but are spking during COVID. The slump isn't huge, but probably very damaging if gun makers put lots of money into increased production capacity counting on a Dem victory in 2016.",4,0.541,NEGATIVE,1.0

And I believe the ebbs and flow of the gun market certainly mirror the political direction of the country. Which is interesting given the current social tensions we are seeing (personal note, I'm a pro-gun moderate liberal.) I'd love liberal groups to be more welcoming to 2A issues, and honestly... it's in the best interests of all morally just Americans, especially those groups that may be systemically oppressed (again, I'd like to avoid the political talk here to respect the subreddit).However, ebbs and flows is just that... Up and down. When it goes down, it eventually goes up. With periods of time of upward or downward trends.But to the original point, the article didn't mention the make of the Bushmaster to add substance to the topic of Remington being sold to the Navajo Nation, but rather as a ploy to draw views/ratings by individuals unaware of the facts to the weapon. When you step back and see that a Bushmaster is just a name brand and not a type, platform, or description... You realize the intent. The better debate would be rather is if AR platforms inherently more dangerous than other semi-automatic rifles, and should American be allowed access (I would argue they are not more dangerous and we should have access, but that's neither here or there).Lastly... Another commenter above made not that the topic was relevant because the Navajo Nation would be stepping away from AR sales. After reading his source, that seems to be true and would indeed provide relevance to the topic, as future investors would be interested in that fact. So I applaud him and accept their is SOME relevance here. However, that still does not provide reason to why it was drawn to the Sandy Hook shooting. And I feel that connection was only made due to my original point above, to draw emotion!Thanks for the friendly and objective debate!",5,0.516,NEGATIVE,0.981

The nation does not get special treatment with respect to taxes and regulations regarding firearms. They make far more with savvy investing than they would ever recoup by skirting the law. Why introduce that much risk for such little gain?So why Remington? Remington has been in trouble for several years now. The last holders, Freedom Group / Cerberus, ran the quality into the ground and most firearm enthusiasts learned to avoid their products. Between poor quality control, rust issues, trigger recalls and much better quality elsewhere, there’s no reason to buy Remington firearms. The small exception to this is the long distance shooting community that uses the R700 time to time. Most of these competitors have switched to Finnish (Tikka /Sako) and Japanese (Howa) rifles as of late. So what about AR15s, those are popular and sales could help Remington?
