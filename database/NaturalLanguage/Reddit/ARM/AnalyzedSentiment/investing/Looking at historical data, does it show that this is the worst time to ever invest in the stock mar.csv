,"Looking at historical data, does it show that this is the worst time to ever invest in the stock market? I say that by looking at the data. For example. Amazon trades at 100x earnings and grows 15 percent a year. That is a terrible stock for anyone trying to actually get a return from the asset itself, but trading it is potentially profitable like it is for every single stock. Also I have another example. Nvidia trades at like 35 x sales. The margins are high but obviously companies like Meta will inevitably have to roll out their own independent GPU solutions to control costs, and therefore the stock itself looks ungodly expensive. The same is looking at arm. Arm which trades at like 150 x earnings, or something crazy, literally grows at like 28 percent. That means it will takes like 26 years to even get a 10 percent return for the equity. Then, if you look at what stocks were trading at in like 2004, Apple, it was like 33 x earnings with higher revenue growth, a tiny market cap, better leadership. This compared to the 2000's investing environment or earlier is terrible, yet it seems people think that they can make investments whenever they want. It goes on and on. Looking at Palantir which trades at a crazy multiple, or basically any software company, yes it's possible to buy Palantir or any stock and it triple, but trying to get earnings at a good multiple in other words, Real INVESTING seems to be literally impossible right now. Even the chinese stock market has collapsed mainly due to companies like Alibaba growing at only 5 percent their topline. And there are questions like how is this possible and is this partly due to extremely irresponsible Fed reserve activity mainly due to QE pushing valuations to their highest levels ever. Also do the people here think that this is the worst investing environment ever when compared to historical pe ratios?","Did you actually look at historical data? There are various metrics for how expensive things are. Every indicator that I'm familiar with shows that things have been more expensive at some point in the past.And there are questions like how is this possible and is this partly due to extremely irresponsible Fed reserve activity mainly due to QE pushing valuations to their highest levels ever.The intelligent investor doesn't say ""The market is wrong, I can't invest in this craziness.""

Even if this is the “worst investing environment of all time” (and it’s objectively not) you’re still stuck putting money in markets if you want to retire comfortably. You can only sit on the sidelines hoping for a crash so long before you miss out on gains and fall behind. Sitting in cash will lose money to inflation. Bonds/treasuries/CDs will preserve your capital but won’t grow it sufficiently to comfortably retire long term. Nobody knows what is going to happen in markets tomorrow, next week, or next year. But we do know that you need to grow your wealth over time by investing it if you want to retire, and we generally know that regular folks cannot accurately time markets.",0,0.534,NEGATIVE,1.0

Stocks consistently go up long term, and the U.S. Government has a vested interest in doing everything they can to prevent economic meltdown. I have 30+ years until I need my retirement savings.

Even the chinese stock market has collapsed mainly due to companies like Alibaba growing at only 5 percent their topline. And there are questions like how is this possible and is this partly due to extremely irresponsible Fed reserve activity mainly due to QE pushing valuations to their highest levels ever. Also do the people here think that this is the worst investing environment ever when compared to historical pe ratios?",is this partly due to extremely irresponsible Fed reserve activity mainly due to QE pushing valuations to their highest levels ever.No - the Fed's role isn't about market valuations. The Fed's mandate is to control inflation and job growth.do the people here think that this is the worst investing environment ever when compared to historical pe ratios?Did you actually look at the data? The S&P 500 PE has been rising since 2008. It's fallen a bit in past few years but it's not at the same levels as in 2000 or 2008.I've seen worst investing environments.,0,0.514,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Looking at historical data, does it show that this is the worst time to ever invest in the stock market? I say that by looking at the data. For example. Amazon trades at 100x earnings and grows 15 percent a year. That is a terrible stock for anyone trying to actually get a return from the asset itself, but trading it is potentially profitable like it is for every single stock. Also I have another example. Nvidia trades at like 35 x sales. The margins are high but obviously companies like Meta will inevitably have to roll out their own independent GPU solutions to control costs, and therefore the stock itself looks ungodly expensive. The same is looking at arm. Arm which trades at like 150 x earnings, or something crazy, literally grows at like 28 percent. That means it will takes like 26 years to even get a 10 percent return for the equity. Then, if you look at what stocks were trading at in like 2004, Apple, it was like 33 x earnings with higher revenue growth, a tiny market cap, better leadership. This compared to the 2000's investing environment or earlier is terrible, yet it seems people think that they can make investments whenever they want. It goes on and on. Looking at Palantir which trades at a crazy multiple, or basically any software company, yes it's possible to buy Palantir or any stock and it triple, but trying to get earnings at a good multiple in other words, Real INVESTING seems to be literally impossible right now.

A block of Parmesan cheese will be worth more than an Italian villa.Gold will cease to exist because Martian farts evaporate it and they fart a lot because of all the cheese.The entertainment industry will embrace puppets. Not the lifelike ones, but crude slapstick humor sends martians into a flatulent frenzy of laughter. Jim Carey will be arrested impersonating a puppet, which will be a capital offense.All of this may seem improbable but I’d give it 50:50 when compared to the deterministic soothsaying of the OP",0,0.515,NEGATIVE,0.999
