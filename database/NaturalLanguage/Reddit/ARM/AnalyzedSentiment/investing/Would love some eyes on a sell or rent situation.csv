,"Hi everyone. I would love a few eyes on this to get your thoughts on what you would consider best for my current situation. I'm going to be moving away from my current house (Property B) and am faced with selling it our renting it out. (This is South Florida- Palm Beach County) I'll give what I think is the relevant data and will be extremely grateful for those willing to offer their wisdom. Thanks so much for your time. Property A is a 3/1 SFH. (Rented out. Great tenant.) Current mortgage (PITI) is $1000. Rental income is $2200. After maintenance and income tax (which I estimate at $500 a month) my net is +$700. Further: Currently owe $115,000 with 24 years left on an 5/1 ARM loan (still have 4 years left on loan before interest rate changes) that currently has a 3.09% rate. Could sale for $400,000 (a conservative estimate). Obviously, selling it would net me $285,000 (hardly any capital gains taxes since I lived in it 2 of the past 5 years). Property B is a 3/2 SFH with 2 offices. (I am about to move out of this within a couple of months). Current mortgage (PITI) is $1850. I spend $100 per month on maintenance. Rent would be $3300 per month if I decided to rent it out. Further: I currently owe $275,000 with a 3.25% fixed rate. My realtor thinks that this could sell for $600,000. And I've lived her the past 2 years, so hardly any capital gains tax here either, giving me flexibility if I decide to sell one or the other. Currently I'm leaning towards holding both as investments and renting them both out. Property management costs would be $0 per month as I would still be close enough to take care of everything. And I wouldn't be buying a new home, where I'm going with my job situation, lodging is taken care of. Thanks again for those of you willing to respond. {Mods, anything in this post that's not supposed to be here just let me know, thanks}","I wouldn’t be a landlord after the govt just got through screwing over landlords for 2 years.I would sell and sink that money into dividend stocks at these dirt cheap prices.

Could you refinance property A to a fixed rate? Even if it is higher than you want, I believe the Fed is going to have to go to extreme measures in the next two years to outpace inflation. You would have a higher rate than you want now, but could refinance back down in the future if it is to your advantage. IMHO- house prices will drop, but not precipitately. You have enough equity to ride it out. It may take 5-10 years, but that rental income might go up as new construction tails off. You might have a gold mine.",0,0.53,NEGATIVE,0.998

Rent would be $3300 per month if I decided to rent it out. Further: I currently owe $275,000 with a 3.25% fixed rate. My realtor thinks that this could sell for $600,000. And I've lived her the past 2 years, so hardly any capital gains tax here either, giving me flexibility if I decide to sell one or the other. Currently I'm leaning towards holding both as investments and renting them both out. Property management costs would be $0 per month as I would still be close enough to take care of everything. And I wouldn't be buying a new home, where I'm going with my job situation, lodging is taken care of. Thanks again for those of you willing to respond. {Mods, anything in this post that's not supposed to be here just let me know, thanks}","Currently I'm leaning towards holding both as investments and renting them both out.Assuming you want the work, sounds like a decent plan.I'd focus the income from the properties into paying off the ARM loan on A. As the way things are going, your interest rate will almost certainly go up in 4 years, and it will let you de-lever. You should be able to get it paid off in about 2-ish years.",0,0.528,POSITIVE,0.55
,"Hi everyone. I would love a few eyes on this to get your thoughts on what you would consider best for my current situation. I'm going to be moving away from my current house (Property B) and am faced with selling it our renting it out. (This is South Florida- Palm Beach County) I'll give what I think is the relevant data and will be extremely grateful for those willing to offer their wisdom. Thanks so much for your time. Property A is a 3/1 SFH. (Rented out. Great tenant.) Current mortgage (PITI) is $1000. Rental income is $2200. After maintenance and income tax (which I estimate at $500 a month) my net is +$700. Further: Currently owe $115,000 with 24 years left on an 5/1 ARM loan (still have 4 years left on loan before interest rate changes) that currently has a 3.09% rate. Could sale for $400,000 (a conservative estimate). Obviously, selling it would net me $285,000 (hardly any capital gains taxes since I lived in it 2 of the past 5 years). Property B is a 3/2 SFH with 2 offices. (I am about to move out of this within a couple of months). Current mortgage (PITI) is $1850. I spend $100 per month on maintenance.

Thanks again for those of you willing to respond. {Mods, anything in this post that's not supposed to be here just let me know, thanks}",I am 100% thinking the same thing as you. I'm going to try to leverage the profits(positive cash flow from both places) that I make and pay off that 5/1 ARM sooner rather than later and enjoy that 3.25% fixed rate from the other property for as long as I can. I might even keep that on the books down the road even if I could pay it all off and use that money for a better investment if one is found. Thank you Zetty! Appreciate you reinforcing the validity of this option.,1,0.53,NEGATIVE,0.8

I got out when covid started, wife and I were getting tired of the work. Overall we did very very well with our houses, both in rental cash flow and capital gains upon sale.All I can say is that if you are going to actively manage, as opposed to letting a property manager do the work, then go for it. Job One is putting good tenants in your house, if you do that you can obviate your biggest risks and headaches. Doing so requires performing credit and other background checks, there are 3rd party companies that will do that for a reasonable fee.I didn't get into real estate until late in life, I really wish I had done so 10-15 years earlier!",0,0.519,POSITIVE,1.0

And I do think getting the right tenant will make or break the situation- it's the major risk I run by renting instead of selling.
