,"Hi All - wanted to get people's thoughts on cocoa bean production. My understanding is that around 60% of the world's production is out of west Africa which is going through a fungicide outbreak due to black pod disease and swallow shoot virus. My understanding is that this result in less production is subsequent years and deforestation to kill off the virus as West African farmers can't typically afford pesticides. Additionally, local farmers are starting to lease there land for gold mining which further reduces the potential for Cacao trees. There is also upcoming EU rules on purchase of cocoa beans from a deforestation country. Do you think South American countries will be able to pick up the supply shortage in the coming years? I don't want to pay an arm and a leg for a chocolate bar ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ https://www.sustainabilitybynumbers.com/p/cocoa-prices",What I think I have been reading and hearing in podcasts is that the west African farmers are still selling at the same prices to the government and the government is the one cashing in making it less hopeful for the farmers. Also Australia is trying to become a grower.The cure for high prices is said to be high prices but with a slow growing crop this could take a while. South America and the big ag companies certainly arenâ€™t going to be blind to the opportunities.,0,0.541,NEGATIVE,0.95

They have a price cap, which was based on the price last year.Didn't hear about Australia, but that makes sense.Out of curiosity, which podcast?",1,0.577,NEGATIVE,0.997
