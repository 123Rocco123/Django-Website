,"First of all, this is not financial advice, you should always do your own DD before listening to internet strangers - but you already know that. Second, the majority of this information can be found and validated in the MetroMile investor presentation here: https://assets.metromile.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/24120556/Ext-Investor-Preso-vFinal.pdf Third, this is my first DD so go easy. Estimated reading time 12 minutes. Ticker Info/Position Ticker: $MILE (formally $INAQ who were the SPAC) Stock Price as of 15th Feb: $17.29 Current Mkt Cap: projected a $1.3b - they only just went public and I think their previous 570m cap was from INAQ thus incorrectly reported. TLDR at the very bottom. My position is 76 shares @ $18.26. It's all I have spare right now as all my other long funds are tied up in BB and NIO, but plan to load up more at the end of the month.

Quick explanation: MetroMile are a digital pay-per-mile insurance company that are starting to massively disrupt the market with a strong focus on AI, machine learning and user experience. Longer description from MM themselves: Metromile is a leading pay-per-mile car insurance company in the U.S. Recognized by Forrester as a top insurance carrier in user experience, it is creating a loyal community of drivers with personalized insurance that is customized to each driver to be more affordable. Powered by machine learning and customer-centric design, Metromile is at the forefront of disrupting a more than $250 billion personal auto insurance industry that has gone unchanged for decades. Through Metromile Enterprise, our software-as-a-service business group, we license our proprietary artificial intelligence claims platform to automate claims, reduce losses associated with fraud, and unlock the productivity of insurance carriers’ employees so they can work on higher-impact experiences. We’re a diverse team that combines Silicon Valley’s best technologists with veterans from Fortune 500 insurers and financial service institutions. This approach ensures that we’re as equally focused on loss ratios, unit economics and profitability as on customer experience and technology innovation. Market disrupting InsureTech, driven by AI, machine learning and a strong focus on transparency and user experience - why does that sound familiar? That's right. When life gives you lemons, you make a disruptive AI based home/rental insurance company called LEMONADE that has blasted off to $163 a share. And when life gives you Lemonade, you take that model and apply it to the pay-per-mile car insurance market. ""Buffet had Geico.

Sophisticated AI driven claim system makes filing and dealing with a claim a piece of cake, all achievable through the app Try before you buy - their FREE Ride Along app analyses your driving and allows you to calculate what you could save and then convert into a real customer, they claim 11% of abandoned quotes online then go onto try Ride Along. The app in general has a 25% referral rate and a 20% conversion rate which is HUGE. Their tech allows enhanced detection of fraudulent claims which lead to a +10% improvement to their contribution margin: Algorithmic Accident Reconstruction replaces manual investigation, More potential fraud cases identified, More potential cases successfully investigated, More confirmed fraud The Numbers The U.S. auto insurance market is worth $250B, globally $700B No U.S. operator has more than 20% market share They have incredibly loyal customers, with industry leading 1 year retention of 63.1% (vs Lemonade's 62%, Roots 33.2%) They industry lead in renewal loss ratio, loss ratio, fraud detection and annualised premium metrics Recent investment and the IPO means they have an est. $294m CASH to pursue growth Their contribution margin has increased EVERY YEAR for 5 years, from - 25% in 2016 to +13% in H1 2020 Their loss ratio has decreased EVERY YEAR for 5 years, from 101% in 2016 to an industry leading 59% in H1 2020 $MILE have spent the last 8 years developing and fine tuning their technology and infrastructure, they are now firmly in growth and profit mode forecasting to hit profitability by Q2 2022. Here's what that operating profit forecast looks like: 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 -41.2m -42.8m -24.8m -20.7m +3.1m +87.1m +225.0m (if this is tricky to read on mobile, they are forecasting hitting +$3.1m in 2022 and then rocketing to +$87m in 2023 and +$225m in 2024) How good are the team behind it? Full disclosure, the below are all excerpts taken from MetroMile's website and not my words, but they looks impressive. CEO Dan Preston: Joined Metromile in 2013 as Chief Technology Officer before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Under his leadership, Metromile has experienced significant policy, premium and employee growth. The company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios. Metromile has been voted a Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and the Phoenix Business Journal. Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and CTO of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. He has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics, remote sensing, and computer vision.Dan holds a master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision from Stanford University and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, where he received the Michtom Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science and graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors in Computer Science. CTO Paw Andersen: A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber's Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies. And then Founder & Chairman David Friedberg, the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki, the NY Post and Linkedin: Former Google employee. The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1B sale to Monsanto in 2013. The Climate Corporation (now known as Climate Field View) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields. From nitrogen levels in soil from historical weather, to satellite imagery mapping out crop health & vegetation maps, it uses data science to make farming better. This guys knows his shit and has a wealth of experience in big data. Expansion, Opportunity and Catalysts They are currently operational in just 8 of 50 U.S. states; Washington, California, Oregon, Illinois, Arizona, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. They plan to be live in 21 states in 2021 and 49 in 2022 Those current 8 states represent 45m potential drivers that can save with MetroMile, that number jumps to 143m drivers in 2022 (with 49 states) representing $160B in potential premiums (seriously, if you look at one thing in that investor deck I linked, jump to slide 30) The IPO transaction has provided an estimated $294 Million in cash to pursue growth opportunities They are looking to expand and cross sell into other verticals such as; Homeowners, Renters, Pet, Warranties & Maintenance through 2021-2022 They are licensing their leading AI claims platform and cannot be just viewed as an auto insurance provider (more on that below) They are integrating and partnering with car manufacturers to refer customers, 2 are already signed up and one of them is FORD, they expect 8 by 2022 so keep an eye out for announcements There are ambitions to go global In December they provided a Q3 earnings update and 2020 forecast exceeding expectations (Source), we should be due Q4/2020 final numbers soon NOT just an insurance provider - FinTech LICENSING Growth This one is important and needs attention - you know that leading, sophisticated, claims AI platform they've built? They are now LICENSING that through their MetroMile ENTERPRISE arm of the business, and its built to work on top of standard claims management software. This licensing delivered $5.6m additional revenue in 2020 and is forecast to increase significantly YoY ($12.4m in 2021 > $21.7m 2022 > $33.7m in 2023 > $48.3m in 2024) - you cannot just look at $MILE as an insurance disruptor, they are also a software/technology company It seems they are not allowed to name everyone who is using their Enterprise tech at this time but do list Tokio Marine, a ""Top 10 US Carrier"" and a ""US Carrier"". They say they have 4 deployed, 22 planned by 2022 and 46 in the pipeline. What about the competition? On a technology level, the closest form of competition I can see is Root, however their USP is that they quote you based on your driving behaviour. It utilises machine learning and an app that analyses your driving before pricing you up. MetroMile does the opposite, it does not charge you at all based on your behaviour, it is per mile. Lemonade could also be classed as a competitor but they focus on the home/rental vertical. On a business model level, Mile Wise (from All State) is the closest, they are also using a pay-per-mile model but lack the same depth of tech behind them compared to $MILE from what I can see. The world and our habits have changed, $MILE are poised to grab that by the horns A pandemic riddled world has seen hundreds of millions of people driving less and burning cash on insured vehicles sitting on their drive ways unused - myself included In the UK, at the height of the pandemic last year only 22% of cars were on the road (Source), that's a whopping 78% decrease and that is not even taking into account that the 22% on the road were likely driving less than usual (YES...I understand $MILE is a U.S. company, unfortunately I could not find any U.S. equivalent data but it's still a relevant stat no doubt replicated to varying degrees throughout the world) A survey shows after the pandemic 25% of drivers plan to drive less: Source (sorry, another UK source I know but I couldn't find similar for the U.S., this is a generalisation of the western world but again as above it will be replicated no doubt to varying degrees) OK...so as I was typing I found this which shows US mileage dropped by as much as 60% during the height of the pandemic last year: Source - the caveat is of course that mileage and car use will absolutely pick up as the pandemic ebbs and flows and eventually ends 22.7% of employed Americans were working from home in September due to the pandemic and in management/professional occupations that number rockets to over 40%: Source When the world emerges from this, office hours and behaviour will never be the same, working-from-home and hybrid ""x days at home and x days in the office"" will become the norm, the pandemic has forced companies and employees to prove they can work just fine from home - and that they have, in many cases exceeded expectations. Before the pandemic was a thing there was STILL a clear need for this in the market, this was always going to be an appealing and great model, COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to bring $MILE to the forefront quicker. Ready to expand. Do you really think all these people who have picked up recipe box subscriptions, online grocery shopping, at home spin/peloton classes and more will revert back to the old way pre-pandemic? Some may, but most will not. People like convenience and ease of use. New habits will stay. Cons/Watch Outs The move to hybrid or work-from-home models may not be adopted as much as we think post-pandemic - personally I don't think this will be an issue because 1) I just cannot see a world where businesses don't adapt to this, it ultimately saves them money and 2) this business model is not built on a pandemic, as I said COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to drive adoption and awareness. The insurance goliaths (i.e. Geico) develop or market their own pay-per-mile model (I am not based in the U.S. so any additional insight in the comments from you guys is welcome, let's make this a discussion) - I don't see this happening any time soon, at least, not to the same complexity that $MILE are achieving, it would require huge investment and development to build anything near what $MILE have but you can't rule Buffet/Geico out Someone like Lemonade expand into the motor/pay-per-mile sector Root create a pay-per-mile model (unlikely imo due to their entire business being based on quoting your behaviour but you cant rule it out) Targeting infrequent drivers is a bit of a niche however this can also be viewed as a positive as they are set to dominate said niche For whatever reason, they do not expand to as many states as quickly as they desire, I will not pretend to understand what potential red tape is there The forecasted profits are from their investor deck so they are of course going to big themselves up, regardless I like what I see Wrap Up/TLDR ""Buffet had Geico.

Quick explanation: MetroMile are a digital pay-per-mile insurance company that are starting to massively disrupt the market with a strong focus on AI, machine learning and user experience. Longer description from MM themselves: Metromile is a leading pay-per-mile car insurance company in the U.S. Recognized by Forrester as a top insurance carrier in user experience, it is creating a loyal community of drivers with personalized insurance that is customized to each driver to be more affordable. Powered by machine learning and customer-centric design, Metromile is at the forefront of disrupting a more than $250 billion personal auto insurance industry that has gone unchanged for decades. Through Metromile Enterprise, our software-as-a-service business group, we license our proprietary artificial intelligence claims platform to automate claims, reduce losses associated with fraud, and unlock the productivity of insurance carriers’ employees so they can work on higher-impact experiences. We’re a diverse team that combines Silicon Valley’s best technologists with veterans from Fortune 500 insurers and financial service institutions. This approach ensures that we’re as equally focused on loss ratios, unit economics and profitability as on customer experience and technology innovation. Market disrupting InsureTech, driven by AI, machine learning and a strong focus on transparency and user experience - why does that sound familiar? That's right. When life gives you lemons, you make a disruptive AI based home/rental insurance company called LEMONADE that has blasted off to $163 a share. And when life gives you Lemonade, you take that model and apply it to the pay-per-mile car insurance market. ""Buffet had Geico.

Full disclosure, the below are all excerpts taken from MetroMile's website and not my words, but they looks impressive. CEO Dan Preston: Joined Metromile in 2013 as Chief Technology Officer before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Under his leadership, Metromile has experienced significant policy, premium and employee growth. The company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios. Metromile has been voted a Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and the Phoenix Business Journal. Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and CTO of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. He has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics, remote sensing, and computer vision.Dan holds a master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision from Stanford University and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, where he received the Michtom Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science and graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors in Computer Science. CTO Paw Andersen: A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber's Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies. And then Founder & Chairman David Friedberg, the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki, the NY Post and Linkedin: Former Google employee. The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1B sale to Monsanto in 2013. The Climate Corporation (now known as Climate Field View) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields. From nitrogen levels in soil from historical weather, to satellite imagery mapping out crop health & vegetation maps, it uses data science to make farming better. This guys knows his shit and has a wealth of experience in big data. Expansion, Opportunity and Catalysts They are currently operational in just 8 of 50 U.S. states; Washington, California, Oregon, Illinois, Arizona, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. They plan to be live in 21 states in 2021 and 49 in 2022 Those current 8 states represent 45m potential drivers that can save with MetroMile, that number jumps to 143m drivers in 2022 (with 49 states) representing $160B in potential premiums (seriously, if you look at one thing in that investor deck I linked, jump to slide 30) The IPO transaction has provided an estimated $294 Million in cash to pursue growth opportunities They are looking to expand and cross sell into other verticals such as; Homeowners, Renters, Pet, Warranties & Maintenance through 2021-2022 They are licensing their leading AI claims platform and cannot be just viewed as an auto insurance provider (more on that below) They are integrating and partnering with car manufacturers to refer customers, 2 are already signed up and one of them is FORD, they expect 8 by 2022 so keep an eye out for announcements There are ambitions to go global In December they provided a Q3 earnings update and 2020 forecast exceeding expectations (Source), we should be due Q4/2020 final numbers soon NOT just an insurance provider - FinTech LICENSING Growth This one is important and needs attention - you know that leading, sophisticated, claims AI platform they've built? They are now LICENSING that through their MetroMile ENTERPRISE arm of the business, and its built to work on top of standard claims management software. This licensing delivered $5.6m additional revenue in 2020 and is forecast to increase significantly YoY ($12.4m in 2021 > $21.7m 2022 > $33.7m in 2023 > $48.3m in 2024) - you cannot just look at $MILE as an insurance disruptor, they are also a software/technology company It seems they are not allowed to name everyone who is using their Enterprise tech at this time but do list Tokio Marine, a ""Top 10 US Carrier"" and a ""US Carrier"". They say they have 4 deployed, 22 planned by 2022 and 46 in the pipeline. What about the competition? On a technology level, the closest form of competition I can see is Root, however their USP is that they quote you based on your driving behaviour. It utilises machine learning and an app that analyses your driving before pricing you up. MetroMile does the opposite, it does not charge you at all based on your behaviour, it is per mile. Lemonade could also be classed as a competitor but they focus on the home/rental vertical. On a business model level, Mile Wise (from All State) is the closest, they are also using a pay-per-mile model but lack the same depth of tech behind them compared to $MILE from what I can see. The world and our habits have changed, $MILE are poised to grab that by the horns A pandemic riddled world has seen hundreds of millions of people driving less and burning cash on insured vehicles sitting on their drive ways unused - myself included In the UK, at the height of the pandemic last year only 22% of cars were on the road (Source), that's a whopping 78% decrease and that is not even taking into account that the 22% on the road were likely driving less than usual (YES...I understand $MILE is a U.S. company, unfortunately I could not find any U.S. equivalent data but it's still a relevant stat no doubt replicated to varying degrees throughout the world) A survey shows after the pandemic 25% of drivers plan to drive less: Source (sorry, another UK source I know but I couldn't find similar for the U.S., this is a generalisation of the western world but again as above it will be replicated no doubt to varying degrees) OK...so as I was typing I found this which shows US mileage dropped by as much as 60% during the height of the pandemic last year: Source - the caveat is of course that mileage and car use will absolutely pick up as the pandemic ebbs and flows and eventually ends 22.7% of employed Americans were working from home in September due to the pandemic and in management/professional occupations that number rockets to over 40%: Source When the world emerges from this, office hours and behaviour will never be the same, working-from-home and hybrid ""x days at home and x days in the office"" will become the norm, the pandemic has forced companies and employees to prove they can work just fine from home - and that they have, in many cases exceeded expectations. Before the pandemic was a thing there was STILL a clear need for this in the market, this was always going to be an appealing and great model, COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to bring $MILE to the forefront quicker. Ready to expand. Do you really think all these people who have picked up recipe box subscriptions, online grocery shopping, at home spin/peloton classes and more will revert back to the old way pre-pandemic? Some may, but most will not. People like convenience and ease of use. New habits will stay. Cons/Watch Outs The move to hybrid or work-from-home models may not be adopted as much as we think post-pandemic - personally I don't think this will be an issue because 1) I just cannot see a world where businesses don't adapt to this, it ultimately saves them money and 2) this business model is not built on a pandemic, as I said COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to drive adoption and awareness. The insurance goliaths (i.e. Geico) develop or market their own pay-per-mile model (I am not based in the U.S. so any additional insight in the comments from you guys is welcome, let's make this a discussion) - I don't see this happening any time soon, at least, not to the same complexity that $MILE are achieving, it would require huge investment and development to build anything near what $MILE have but you can't rule Buffet/Geico out Someone like Lemonade expand into the motor/pay-per-mile sector Root create a pay-per-mile model (unlikely imo due to their entire business being based on quoting your behaviour but you cant rule it out) Targeting infrequent drivers is a bit of a niche however this can also be viewed as a positive as they are set to dominate said niche For whatever reason, they do not expand to as many states as quickly as they desire, I will not pretend to understand what potential red tape is there The forecasted profits are from their investor deck so they are of course going to big themselves up, regardless I like what I see Wrap Up/TLDR ""Buffet had Geico.

Market disrupting InsureTech, driven by AI, machine learning and a strong focus on transparency and user experience - why does that sound familiar? That's right. When life gives you lemons, you make a disruptive AI based home/rental insurance company called LEMONADE that has blasted off to $163 a share. And when life gives you Lemonade, you take that model and apply it to the pay-per-mile car insurance market. ""Buffet had Geico.

Full disclosure, the below are all excerpts taken from MetroMile's website and not my words, but they looks impressive. CEO Dan Preston: Joined Metromile in 2013 as Chief Technology Officer before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Under his leadership, Metromile has experienced significant policy, premium and employee growth. The company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios. Metromile has been voted a Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and the Phoenix Business Journal. Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and CTO of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. He has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics, remote sensing, and computer vision.Dan holds a master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision from Stanford University and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, where he received the Michtom Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science and graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors in Computer Science. CTO Paw Andersen: A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber's Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies. And then Founder & Chairman David Friedberg, the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki, the NY Post and Linkedin: Former Google employee. The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1B sale to Monsanto in 2013. The Climate Corporation (now known as Climate Field View) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields. From nitrogen levels in soil from historical weather, to satellite imagery mapping out crop health & vegetation maps, it uses data science to make farming better. This guys knows his shit and has a wealth of experience in big data. Expansion, Opportunity and Catalysts They are currently operational in just 8 of 50 U.S. states; Washington, California, Oregon, Illinois, Arizona, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. They plan to be live in 21 states in 2021 and 49 in 2022 Those current 8 states represent 45m potential drivers that can save with MetroMile, that number jumps to 143m drivers in 2022 (with 49 states) representing $160B in potential premiums (seriously, if you look at one thing in that investor deck I linked, jump to slide 30) The IPO transaction has provided an estimated $294 Million in cash to pursue growth opportunities They are looking to expand and cross sell into other verticals such as; Homeowners, Renters, Pet, Warranties & Maintenance through 2021-2022 They are licensing their leading AI claims platform and cannot be just viewed as an auto insurance provider (more on that below) They are integrating and partnering with car manufacturers to refer customers, 2 are already signed up and one of them is FORD, they expect 8 by 2022 so keep an eye out for announcements There are ambitions to go global In December they provided a Q3 earnings update and 2020 forecast exceeding expectations (Source), we should be due Q4/2020 final numbers soon NOT just an insurance provider - FinTech LICENSING Growth This one is important and needs attention - you know that leading, sophisticated, claims AI platform they've built? They are now LICENSING that through their MetroMile ENTERPRISE arm of the business, and its built to work on top of standard claims management software. This licensing delivered $5.6m additional revenue in 2020 and is forecast to increase significantly YoY ($12.4m in 2021 > $21.7m 2022 > $33.7m in 2023 > $48.3m in 2024) - you cannot just look at $MILE as an insurance disruptor, they are also a software/technology company It seems they are not allowed to name everyone who is using their Enterprise tech at this time but do list Tokio Marine, a ""Top 10 US Carrier"" and a ""US Carrier"". They say they have 4 deployed, 22 planned by 2022 and 46 in the pipeline. What about the competition? On a technology level, the closest form of competition I can see is Root, however their USP is that they quote you based on your driving behaviour. It utilises machine learning and an app that analyses your driving before pricing you up. MetroMile does the opposite, it does not charge you at all based on your behaviour, it is per mile. Lemonade could also be classed as a competitor but they focus on the home/rental vertical. On a business model level, Mile Wise (from All State) is the closest, they are also using a pay-per-mile model but lack the same depth of tech behind them compared to $MILE from what I can see.

I like the stock, I have a lot of confidence in it.","Excellent point, let me just add the following.Every company will eventually shift to this model or a hybrid or something even better. Safeco just tracks you for 6 months, it figures your driving habits, and gives you lifelong discount and stops tracking after six months.I'm pretty sure every carrier has had the best loss ratio in 2020.The post was written by someone who does not understand insurance (I appreciate the post nonetheless, just saying), the product highlights is fluff, could have been written for any carrier.This isn't Chamath's only insurance play, Chamath thinks he is smarter than anyone else and he sees the size of the market and a sleeping industry that's slow to adapt to technology and he thinks he will reinvent the wheel by using AI. It's not that Chamath isn't extraordinary, and it's not that I don't like him, but just because Chamath is involved that means nothing. Open up the insurance journal, AI is the buzzword. Also, if you are a billionaire investor, you really want to have your own insurance carrier, like wtf are you doing without one? Carriers don't make money running insurance operations, money is only made in investments, Chamath and the crew will make money investing, the performance of the insurance carrier is really not as important, an industry standard will do just fine.To think this company is special and will be a game changer is wrong. Home and auto insurance are increasingly becoming commodities, and giants already have everything they need to provide all technology that you can possibly imagine, they are waiting for people to be ready for it.The industry is changing, but the entire industry is changing. What I would like to see is the use of drones instead of adjusters. A drone could be dispatched within minutes to the scene of the accident, determine fault, asses damage, as well as figure out if there is structural damage. This is something that is a real opportunity, because it's an absolute cost reduction. There isn't a carrier that wouldn't save money by getting a drone, lower cost, more accurate estimates, faster.Also, drones can be used for simple property inspections.",1,0.534,NEGATIVE,1.0

I am not too knowledgeable about MM's process or strategy but I went through State Farm's agent aspirant program and was lining up my own office before I decided against insurance, so I personally know a bit about car insurance in the least.MM's idea on pay-per-mile isn't completely unique but having a company filling a specific niche and doing it well can easily be a winning strategy. They don't need to beat GEICO, Progressive, State Farm, etc in every area. They need to grab about 3-4% of the market share. In major cities, it is highly likely that they will be able to lower those costs even more. There is literally no reason for a large company to attempt to compete with a niche company for people who pay so little in big cities. It makes more sense for bigger companies to focus on people outside of cities who commute. The people who bring homeowners policies and multiple vehicles.MM has a niche market that they can fill. If the OP believes they are going to be the next GEICO, they maybe a bit crazy... But thinking a company like this can't succeed based on your reasons shows a lack of knowledge as well... I'm sorry.Also, the drone idea would be cool and all until your company was riddled with fraudulent claims that the drone has no ability to detect.

Quick explanation: MetroMile are a digital pay-per-mile insurance company that are starting to massively disrupt the market with a strong focus on AI, machine learning and user experience. Longer description from MM themselves: Metromile is a leading pay-per-mile car insurance company in the U.S. Recognized by Forrester as a top insurance carrier in user experience, it is creating a loyal community of drivers with personalized insurance that is customized to each driver to be more affordable. Powered by machine learning and customer-centric design, Metromile is at the forefront of disrupting a more than $250 billion personal auto insurance industry that has gone unchanged for decades. Through Metromile Enterprise, our software-as-a-service business group, we license our proprietary artificial intelligence claims platform to automate claims, reduce losses associated with fraud, and unlock the productivity of insurance carriers’ employees so they can work on higher-impact experiences. We’re a diverse team that combines Silicon Valley’s best technologists with veterans from Fortune 500 insurers and financial service institutions. This approach ensures that we’re as equally focused on loss ratios, unit economics and profitability as on customer experience and technology innovation. Market disrupting InsureTech, driven by AI, machine learning and a strong focus on transparency and user experience - why does that sound familiar? That's right. When life gives you lemons, you make a disruptive AI based home/rental insurance company called LEMONADE that has blasted off to $163 a share. And when life gives you Lemonade, you take that model and apply it to the pay-per-mile car insurance market. ""Buffet had Geico.

Full disclosure, the below are all excerpts taken from MetroMile's website and not my words, but they looks impressive. CEO Dan Preston: Joined Metromile in 2013 as Chief Technology Officer before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Under his leadership, Metromile has experienced significant policy, premium and employee growth. The company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios. Metromile has been voted a Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and the Phoenix Business Journal. Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and CTO of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. He has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics, remote sensing, and computer vision.Dan holds a master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision from Stanford University and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, where he received the Michtom Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science and graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors in Computer Science. CTO Paw Andersen: A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber's Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies. And then Founder & Chairman David Friedberg, the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki, the NY Post and Linkedin: Former Google employee. The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1B sale to Monsanto in 2013. The Climate Corporation (now known as Climate Field View) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields. From nitrogen levels in soil from historical weather, to satellite imagery mapping out crop health & vegetation maps, it uses data science to make farming better. This guys knows his shit and has a wealth of experience in big data. Expansion, Opportunity and Catalysts They are currently operational in just 8 of 50 U.S. states; Washington, California, Oregon, Illinois, Arizona, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. They plan to be live in 21 states in 2021 and 49 in 2022 Those current 8 states represent 45m potential drivers that can save with MetroMile, that number jumps to 143m drivers in 2022 (with 49 states) representing $160B in potential premiums (seriously, if you look at one thing in that investor deck I linked, jump to slide 30) The IPO transaction has provided an estimated $294 Million in cash to pursue growth opportunities They are looking to expand and cross sell into other verticals such as; Homeowners, Renters, Pet, Warranties & Maintenance through 2021-2022 They are licensing their leading AI claims platform and cannot be just viewed as an auto insurance provider (more on that below) They are integrating and partnering with car manufacturers to refer customers, 2 are already signed up and one of them is FORD, they expect 8 by 2022 so keep an eye out for announcements There are ambitions to go global In December they provided a Q3 earnings update and 2020 forecast exceeding expectations (Source), we should be due Q4/2020 final numbers soon NOT just an insurance provider - FinTech LICENSING Growth This one is important and needs attention - you know that leading, sophisticated, claims AI platform they've built? They are now LICENSING that through their MetroMile ENTERPRISE arm of the business, and its built to work on top of standard claims management software. This licensing delivered $5.6m additional revenue in 2020 and is forecast to increase significantly YoY ($12.4m in 2021 > $21.7m 2022 > $33.7m in 2023 > $48.3m in 2024) - you cannot just look at $MILE as an insurance disruptor, they are also a software/technology company It seems they are not allowed to name everyone who is using their Enterprise tech at this time but do list Tokio Marine, a ""Top 10 US Carrier"" and a ""US Carrier"". They say they have 4 deployed, 22 planned by 2022 and 46 in the pipeline. What about the competition? On a technology level, the closest form of competition I can see is Root, however their USP is that they quote you based on your driving behaviour. It utilises machine learning and an app that analyses your driving before pricing you up. MetroMile does the opposite, it does not charge you at all based on your behaviour, it is per mile. Lemonade could also be classed as a competitor but they focus on the home/rental vertical. On a business model level, Mile Wise (from All State) is the closest, they are also using a pay-per-mile model but lack the same depth of tech behind them compared to $MILE from what I can see. The world and our habits have changed, $MILE are poised to grab that by the horns A pandemic riddled world has seen hundreds of millions of people driving less and burning cash on insured vehicles sitting on their drive ways unused - myself included In the UK, at the height of the pandemic last year only 22% of cars were on the road (Source), that's a whopping 78% decrease and that is not even taking into account that the 22% on the road were likely driving less than usual (YES...I understand $MILE is a U.S. company, unfortunately I could not find any U.S. equivalent data but it's still a relevant stat no doubt replicated to varying degrees throughout the world) A survey shows after the pandemic 25% of drivers plan to drive less: Source (sorry, another UK source I know but I couldn't find similar for the U.S., this is a generalisation of the western world but again as above it will be replicated no doubt to varying degrees) OK...so as I was typing I found this which shows US mileage dropped by as much as 60% during the height of the pandemic last year: Source - the caveat is of course that mileage and car use will absolutely pick up as the pandemic ebbs and flows and eventually ends 22.7% of employed Americans were working from home in September due to the pandemic and in management/professional occupations that number rockets to over 40%: Source When the world emerges from this, office hours and behaviour will never be the same, working-from-home and hybrid ""x days at home and x days in the office"" will become the norm, the pandemic has forced companies and employees to prove they can work just fine from home - and that they have, in many cases exceeded expectations. Before the pandemic was a thing there was STILL a clear need for this in the market, this was always going to be an appealing and great model, COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to bring $MILE to the forefront quicker. Ready to expand. Do you really think all these people who have picked up recipe box subscriptions, online grocery shopping, at home spin/peloton classes and more will revert back to the old way pre-pandemic? Some may, but most will not. People like convenience and ease of use. New habits will stay. Cons/Watch Outs The move to hybrid or work-from-home models may not be adopted as much as we think post-pandemic - personally I don't think this will be an issue because 1) I just cannot see a world where businesses don't adapt to this, it ultimately saves them money and 2) this business model is not built on a pandemic, as I said COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to drive adoption and awareness. The insurance goliaths (i.e. Geico) develop or market their own pay-per-mile model (I am not based in the U.S. so any additional insight in the comments from you guys is welcome, let's make this a discussion) - I don't see this happening any time soon, at least, not to the same complexity that $MILE are achieving, it would require huge investment and development to build anything near what $MILE have but you can't rule Buffet/Geico out Someone like Lemonade expand into the motor/pay-per-mile sector Root create a pay-per-mile model (unlikely imo due to their entire business being based on quoting your behaviour but you cant rule it out) Targeting infrequent drivers is a bit of a niche however this can also be viewed as a positive as they are set to dominate said niche For whatever reason, they do not expand to as many states as quickly as they desire, I will not pretend to understand what potential red tape is there The forecasted profits are from their investor deck so they are of course going to big themselves up, regardless I like what I see Wrap Up/TLDR ""Buffet had Geico.

Full disclosure, the below are all excerpts taken from MetroMile's website and not my words, but they looks impressive. CEO Dan Preston: Joined Metromile in 2013 as Chief Technology Officer before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Under his leadership, Metromile has experienced significant policy, premium and employee growth. The company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios. Metromile has been voted a Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and the Phoenix Business Journal. Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and CTO of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. He has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics, remote sensing, and computer vision.Dan holds a master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision from Stanford University and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, where he received the Michtom Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science and graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors in Computer Science. CTO Paw Andersen: A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber's Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies. And then Founder & Chairman David Friedberg, the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki, the NY Post and Linkedin: Former Google employee. The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1B sale to Monsanto in 2013. The Climate Corporation (now known as Climate Field View) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields. From nitrogen levels in soil from historical weather, to satellite imagery mapping out crop health & vegetation maps, it uses data science to make farming better. This guys knows his shit and has a wealth of experience in big data. Expansion, Opportunity and Catalysts They are currently operational in just 8 of 50 U.S. states; Washington, California, Oregon, Illinois, Arizona, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. They plan to be live in 21 states in 2021 and 49 in 2022 Those current 8 states represent 45m potential drivers that can save with MetroMile, that number jumps to 143m drivers in 2022 (with 49 states) representing $160B in potential premiums (seriously, if you look at one thing in that investor deck I linked, jump to slide 30) The IPO transaction has provided an estimated $294 Million in cash to pursue growth opportunities They are looking to expand and cross sell into other verticals such as; Homeowners, Renters, Pet, Warranties & Maintenance through 2021-2022 They are licensing their leading AI claims platform and cannot be just viewed as an auto insurance provider (more on that below) They are integrating and partnering with car manufacturers to refer customers, 2 are already signed up and one of them is FORD, they expect 8 by 2022 so keep an eye out for announcements There are ambitions to go global In December they provided a Q3 earnings update and 2020 forecast exceeding expectations (Source), we should be due Q4/2020 final numbers soon NOT just an insurance provider - FinTech LICENSING Growth This one is important and needs attention - you know that leading, sophisticated, claims AI platform they've built? They are now LICENSING that through their MetroMile ENTERPRISE arm of the business, and its built to work on top of standard claims management software. This licensing delivered $5.6m additional revenue in 2020 and is forecast to increase significantly YoY ($12.4m in 2021 > $21.7m 2022 > $33.7m in 2023 > $48.3m in 2024) - you cannot just look at $MILE as an insurance disruptor, they are also a software/technology company It seems they are not allowed to name everyone who is using their Enterprise tech at this time but do list Tokio Marine, a ""Top 10 US Carrier"" and a ""US Carrier"". They say they have 4 deployed, 22 planned by 2022 and 46 in the pipeline. What about the competition? On a technology level, the closest form of competition I can see is Root, however their USP is that they quote you based on your driving behaviour. It utilises machine learning and an app that analyses your driving before pricing you up. MetroMile does the opposite, it does not charge you at all based on your behaviour, it is per mile. Lemonade could also be classed as a competitor but they focus on the home/rental vertical. On a business model level, Mile Wise (from All State) is the closest, they are also using a pay-per-mile model but lack the same depth of tech behind them compared to $MILE from what I can see.

Do you really think all these people who have picked up recipe box subscriptions, online grocery shopping, at home spin/peloton classes and more will revert back to the old way pre-pandemic?

Cons/Watch Outs The move to hybrid or work-from-home models may not be adopted as much as we think post-pandemic - personally I don't think this will be an issue because 1) I just cannot see a world where businesses don't adapt to this, it ultimately saves them money and 2) this business model is not built on a pandemic, as I said COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to drive adoption and awareness. The insurance goliaths (i.e. Geico) develop or market their own pay-per-mile model (I am not based in the U.S. so any additional insight in the comments from you guys is welcome, let's make this a discussion) - I don't see this happening any time soon, at least, not to the same complexity that $MILE are achieving, it would require huge investment and development to build anything near what $MILE have but you can't rule Buffet/Geico out Someone like Lemonade expand into the motor/pay-per-mile sector Root create a pay-per-mile model (unlikely imo due to their entire business being based on quoting your behaviour but you cant rule it out) Targeting infrequent drivers is a bit of a niche however this can also be viewed as a positive as they are set to dominate said niche For whatever reason, they do not expand to as many states as quickly as they desire, I will not pretend to understand what potential red tape is there The forecasted profits are from their investor deck so they are of course going to big themselves up, regardless I like what I see Wrap Up/TLDR ""Buffet had Geico.

Full disclosure, the below are all excerpts taken from MetroMile's website and not my words, but they looks impressive. CEO Dan Preston: Joined Metromile in 2013 as Chief Technology Officer before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Under his leadership, Metromile has experienced significant policy, premium and employee growth. The company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios. Metromile has been voted a Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and the Phoenix Business Journal. Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and CTO of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. He has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics, remote sensing, and computer vision.Dan holds a master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision from Stanford University and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, where he received the Michtom Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science and graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors in Computer Science. CTO Paw Andersen: A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber's Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies. And then Founder & Chairman David Friedberg, the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki, the NY Post and Linkedin: Former Google employee. The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1B sale to Monsanto in 2013. The Climate Corporation (now known as Climate Field View) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields. From nitrogen levels in soil from historical weather, to satellite imagery mapping out crop health & vegetation maps, it uses data science to make farming better. This guys knows his shit and has a wealth of experience in big data. Expansion, Opportunity and Catalysts They are currently operational in just 8 of 50 U.S. states; Washington, California, Oregon, Illinois, Arizona, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. They plan to be live in 21 states in 2021 and 49 in 2022 Those current 8 states represent 45m potential drivers that can save with MetroMile, that number jumps to 143m drivers in 2022 (with 49 states) representing $160B in potential premiums (seriously, if you look at one thing in that investor deck I linked, jump to slide 30) The IPO transaction has provided an estimated $294 Million in cash to pursue growth opportunities They are looking to expand and cross sell into other verticals such as; Homeowners, Renters, Pet, Warranties & Maintenance through 2021-2022 They are licensing their leading AI claims platform and cannot be just viewed as an auto insurance provider (more on that below) They are integrating and partnering with car manufacturers to refer customers, 2 are already signed up and one of them is FORD, they expect 8 by 2022 so keep an eye out for announcements There are ambitions to go global In December they provided a Q3 earnings update and 2020 forecast exceeding expectations (Source), we should be due Q4/2020 final numbers soon NOT just an insurance provider - FinTech LICENSING Growth This one is important and needs attention - you know that leading, sophisticated, claims AI platform they've built? They are now LICENSING that through their MetroMile ENTERPRISE arm of the business, and its built to work on top of standard claims management software. This licensing delivered $5.6m additional revenue in 2020 and is forecast to increase significantly YoY ($12.4m in 2021 > $21.7m 2022 > $33.7m in 2023 > $48.3m in 2024) - you cannot just look at $MILE as an insurance disruptor, they are also a software/technology company It seems they are not allowed to name everyone who is using their Enterprise tech at this time but do list Tokio Marine, a ""Top 10 US Carrier"" and a ""US Carrier"". They say they have 4 deployed, 22 planned by 2022 and 46 in the pipeline. What about the competition? On a technology level, the closest form of competition I can see is Root, however their USP is that they quote you based on your driving behaviour. It utilises machine learning and an app that analyses your driving before pricing you up. MetroMile does the opposite, it does not charge you at all based on your behaviour, it is per mile. Lemonade could also be classed as a competitor but they focus on the home/rental vertical. On a business model level, Mile Wise (from All State) is the closest, they are also using a pay-per-mile model but lack the same depth of tech behind them compared to $MILE from what I can see. The world and our habits have changed, $MILE are poised to grab that by the horns A pandemic riddled world has seen hundreds of millions of people driving less and burning cash on insured vehicles sitting on their drive ways unused - myself included In the UK, at the height of the pandemic last year only 22% of cars were on the road (Source), that's a whopping 78% decrease and that is not even taking into account that the 22% on the road were likely driving less than usual (YES...I understand $MILE is a U.S. company, unfortunately I could not find any U.S. equivalent data but it's still a relevant stat no doubt replicated to varying degrees throughout the world) A survey shows after the pandemic 25% of drivers plan to drive less: Source (sorry, another UK source I know but I couldn't find similar for the U.S., this is a generalisation of the western world but again as above it will be replicated no doubt to varying degrees) OK...so as I was typing I found this which shows US mileage dropped by as much as 60% during the height of the pandemic last year: Source - the caveat is of course that mileage and car use will absolutely pick up as the pandemic ebbs and flows and eventually ends 22.7% of employed Americans were working from home in September due to the pandemic and in management/professional occupations that number rockets to over 40%: Source When the world emerges from this, office hours and behaviour will never be the same, working-from-home and hybrid ""x days at home and x days in the office"" will become the norm, the pandemic has forced companies and employees to prove they can work just fine from home - and that they have, in many cases exceeded expectations.

Do you really think all these people who have picked up recipe box subscriptions, online grocery shopping, at home spin/peloton classes and more will revert back to the old way pre-pandemic? Some may, but most will not. People like convenience and ease of use. New habits will stay. Cons/Watch Outs The move to hybrid or work-from-home models may not be adopted as much as we think post-pandemic - personally I don't think this will be an issue because 1) I just cannot see a world where businesses don't adapt to this, it ultimately saves them money and 2) this business model is not built on a pandemic, as I said COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to drive adoption and awareness. The insurance goliaths (i.e. Geico) develop or market their own pay-per-mile model (I am not based in the U.S. so any additional insight in the comments from you guys is welcome, let's make this a discussion) - I don't see this happening any time soon, at least, not to the same complexity that $MILE are achieving, it would require huge investment and development to build anything near what $MILE have but you can't rule Buffet/Geico out Someone like Lemonade expand into the motor/pay-per-mile sector Root create a pay-per-mile model (unlikely imo due to their entire business being based on quoting your behaviour but you cant rule it out) Targeting infrequent drivers is a bit of a niche however this can also be viewed as a positive as they are set to dominate said niche For whatever reason, they do not expand to as many states as quickly as they desire, I will not pretend to understand what potential red tape is there The forecasted profits are from their investor deck so they are of course going to big themselves up, regardless I like what I see Wrap Up/TLDR ""Buffet had Geico.

Full disclosure, the below are all excerpts taken from MetroMile's website and not my words, but they looks impressive. CEO Dan Preston: Joined Metromile in 2013 as Chief Technology Officer before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Under his leadership, Metromile has experienced significant policy, premium and employee growth. The company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios. Metromile has been voted a Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and the Phoenix Business Journal. Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and CTO of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. He has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics, remote sensing, and computer vision.Dan holds a master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision from Stanford University and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, where he received the Michtom Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science and graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors in Computer Science. CTO Paw Andersen: A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber's Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies. And then Founder & Chairman David Friedberg, the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki, the NY Post and Linkedin: Former Google employee. The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1B sale to Monsanto in 2013. The Climate Corporation (now known as Climate Field View) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields. From nitrogen levels in soil from historical weather, to satellite imagery mapping out crop health & vegetation maps, it uses data science to make farming better. This guys knows his shit and has a wealth of experience in big data. Expansion, Opportunity and Catalysts They are currently operational in just 8 of 50 U.S. states; Washington, California, Oregon, Illinois, Arizona, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. They plan to be live in 21 states in 2021 and 49 in 2022 Those current 8 states represent 45m potential drivers that can save with MetroMile, that number jumps to 143m drivers in 2022 (with 49 states) representing $160B in potential premiums (seriously, if you look at one thing in that investor deck I linked, jump to slide 30) The IPO transaction has provided an estimated $294 Million in cash to pursue growth opportunities They are looking to expand and cross sell into other verticals such as; Homeowners, Renters, Pet, Warranties & Maintenance through 2021-2022 They are licensing their leading AI claims platform and cannot be just viewed as an auto insurance provider (more on that below) They are integrating and partnering with car manufacturers to refer customers, 2 are already signed up and one of them is FORD, they expect 8 by 2022 so keep an eye out for announcements There are ambitions to go global In December they provided a Q3 earnings update and 2020 forecast exceeding expectations (Source), we should be due Q4/2020 final numbers soon NOT just an insurance provider - FinTech LICENSING Growth This one is important and needs attention - you know that leading, sophisticated, claims AI platform they've built? They are now LICENSING that through their MetroMile ENTERPRISE arm of the business, and its built to work on top of standard claims management software. This licensing delivered $5.6m additional revenue in 2020 and is forecast to increase significantly YoY ($12.4m in 2021 > $21.7m 2022 > $33.7m in 2023 > $48.3m in 2024) - you cannot just look at $MILE as an insurance disruptor, they are also a software/technology company It seems they are not allowed to name everyone who is using their Enterprise tech at this time but do list Tokio Marine, a ""Top 10 US Carrier"" and a ""US Carrier"". They say they have 4 deployed, 22 planned by 2022 and 46 in the pipeline. What about the competition? On a technology level, the closest form of competition I can see is Root, however their USP is that they quote you based on your driving behaviour. It utilises machine learning and an app that analyses your driving before pricing you up. MetroMile does the opposite, it does not charge you at all based on your behaviour, it is per mile. Lemonade could also be classed as a competitor but they focus on the home/rental vertical. On a business model level, Mile Wise (from All State) is the closest, they are also using a pay-per-mile model but lack the same depth of tech behind them compared to $MILE from what I can see. The world and our habits have changed, $MILE are poised to grab that by the horns A pandemic riddled world has seen hundreds of millions of people driving less and burning cash on insured vehicles sitting on their drive ways unused - myself included In the UK, at the height of the pandemic last year only 22% of cars were on the road (Source), that's a whopping 78% decrease and that is not even taking into account that the 22% on the road were likely driving less than usual (YES...I understand $MILE is a U.S. company, unfortunately I could not find any U.S. equivalent data but it's still a relevant stat no doubt replicated to varying degrees throughout the world) A survey shows after the pandemic 25% of drivers plan to drive less: Source (sorry, another UK source I know but I couldn't find similar for the U.S., this is a generalisation of the western world but again as above it will be replicated no doubt to varying degrees) OK...so as I was typing I found this which shows US mileage dropped by as much as 60% during the height of the pandemic last year: Source - the caveat is of course that mileage and car use will absolutely pick up as the pandemic ebbs and flows and eventually ends 22.7% of employed Americans were working from home in September due to the pandemic and in management/professional occupations that number rockets to over 40%: Source When the world emerges from this, office hours and behaviour will never be the same, working-from-home and hybrid ""x days at home and x days in the office"" will become the norm, the pandemic has forced companies and employees to prove they can work just fine from home - and that they have, in many cases exceeded expectations. Before the pandemic was a thing there was STILL a clear need for this in the market, this was always going to be an appealing and great model, COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to bring $MILE to the forefront quicker. Ready to expand. Do you really think all these people who have picked up recipe box subscriptions, online grocery shopping, at home spin/peloton classes and more will revert back to the old way pre-pandemic? Some may, but most will not. People like convenience and ease of use. New habits will stay. Cons/Watch Outs The move to hybrid or work-from-home models may not be adopted as much as we think post-pandemic - personally I don't think this will be an issue because 1) I just cannot see a world where businesses don't adapt to this, it ultimately saves them money and 2) this business model is not built on a pandemic, as I said COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to drive adoption and awareness. The insurance goliaths (i.e. Geico) develop or market their own pay-per-mile model (I am not based in the U.S. so any additional insight in the comments from you guys is welcome, let's make this a discussion) - I don't see this happening any time soon, at least, not to the same complexity that $MILE are achieving, it would require huge investment and development to build anything near what $MILE have but you can't rule Buffet/Geico out Someone like Lemonade expand into the motor/pay-per-mile sector Root create a pay-per-mile model (unlikely imo due to their entire business being based on quoting your behaviour but you cant rule it out) Targeting infrequent drivers is a bit of a niche however this can also be viewed as a positive as they are set to dominate said niche For whatever reason, they do not expand to as many states as quickly as they desire, I will not pretend to understand what potential red tape is there The forecasted profits are from their investor deck so they are of course going to big themselves up, regardless I like what I see Wrap Up/TLDR ""Buffet had Geico.

IIRC their only client is an early investor.The real innovation in this space happens when firms figure out how to structurally reduce the cost of distribution (expense ratio) which then allows the firm to pass on cost savings to customers via lower policy costs. I'm not saying Metromile won't be able to do this, but I see no evidence that they have made any progress on this front. If you look at Progressive/Geico, they have expense ratios of 15-20% of premium. For Metromile to beat them they need to find a way to structurally reduce their expense base as % of premium to pass on savings to customers.Even assuming that all of Metromile's costs are fixed (which they aren't) the scale required for them to even approach those expense ratios is pretty ridiculous tbhOn top of that, regulators require carriers to have premium equal to roughly 3x book value. If they keep losing so much money they're gonna need to raise equity to even be allowed to grow w/o running into capital constraints - assuming their costs are 100% fixed they need to grow premium significantly to be profitable and iirc they don't have capital base to support that level of premium unless IPO gave them a bunch of $ (but this is something to check out before you decide to invest)",2,0.52,NEGATIVE,1.0

Full disclosure, the below are all excerpts taken from MetroMile's website and not my words, but they looks impressive. CEO Dan Preston: Joined Metromile in 2013 as Chief Technology Officer before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Under his leadership, Metromile has experienced significant policy, premium and employee growth. The company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios. Metromile has been voted a Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and the Phoenix Business Journal. Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and CTO of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. He has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics, remote sensing, and computer vision.Dan holds a master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision from Stanford University and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, where he received the Michtom Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science and graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors in Computer Science. CTO Paw Andersen: A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber's Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies. And then Founder & Chairman David Friedberg, the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki, the NY Post and Linkedin: Former Google employee. The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1B sale to Monsanto in 2013. The Climate Corporation (now known as Climate Field View) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields. From nitrogen levels in soil from historical weather, to satellite imagery mapping out crop health & vegetation maps, it uses data science to make farming better. This guys knows his shit and has a wealth of experience in big data. Expansion, Opportunity and Catalysts They are currently operational in just 8 of 50 U.S. states; Washington, California, Oregon, Illinois, Arizona, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. They plan to be live in 21 states in 2021 and 49 in 2022 Those current 8 states represent 45m potential drivers that can save with MetroMile, that number jumps to 143m drivers in 2022 (with 49 states) representing $160B in potential premiums (seriously, if you look at one thing in that investor deck I linked, jump to slide 30) The IPO transaction has provided an estimated $294 Million in cash to pursue growth opportunities They are looking to expand and cross sell into other verticals such as; Homeowners, Renters, Pet, Warranties & Maintenance through 2021-2022 They are licensing their leading AI claims platform and cannot be just viewed as an auto insurance provider (more on that below) They are integrating and partnering with car manufacturers to refer customers, 2 are already signed up and one of them is FORD, they expect 8 by 2022 so keep an eye out for announcements There are ambitions to go global In December they provided a Q3 earnings update and 2020 forecast exceeding expectations (Source), we should be due Q4/2020 final numbers soon NOT just an insurance provider - FinTech LICENSING Growth This one is important and needs attention - you know that leading, sophisticated, claims AI platform they've built? They are now LICENSING that through their MetroMile ENTERPRISE arm of the business, and its built to work on top of standard claims management software. This licensing delivered $5.6m additional revenue in 2020 and is forecast to increase significantly YoY ($12.4m in 2021 > $21.7m 2022 > $33.7m in 2023 > $48.3m in 2024) - you cannot just look at $MILE as an insurance disruptor, they are also a software/technology company It seems they are not allowed to name everyone who is using their Enterprise tech at this time but do list Tokio Marine, a ""Top 10 US Carrier"" and a ""US Carrier"". They say they have 4 deployed, 22 planned by 2022 and 46 in the pipeline. What about the competition? On a technology level, the closest form of competition I can see is Root, however their USP is that they quote you based on your driving behaviour. It utilises machine learning and an app that analyses your driving before pricing you up. MetroMile does the opposite, it does not charge you at all based on your behaviour, it is per mile. Lemonade could also be classed as a competitor but they focus on the home/rental vertical. On a business model level, Mile Wise (from All State) is the closest, they are also using a pay-per-mile model but lack the same depth of tech behind them compared to $MILE from what I can see. The world and our habits have changed, $MILE are poised to grab that by the horns A pandemic riddled world has seen hundreds of millions of people driving less and burning cash on insured vehicles sitting on their drive ways unused - myself included In the UK, at the height of the pandemic last year only 22% of cars were on the road (Source), that's a whopping 78% decrease and that is not even taking into account that the 22% on the road were likely driving less than usual (YES...I understand $MILE is a U.S. company, unfortunately I could not find any U.S. equivalent data but it's still a relevant stat no doubt replicated to varying degrees throughout the world) A survey shows after the pandemic 25% of drivers plan to drive less: Source (sorry, another UK source I know but I couldn't find similar for the U.S., this is a generalisation of the western world but again as above it will be replicated no doubt to varying degrees) OK...so as I was typing I found this which shows US mileage dropped by as much as 60% during the height of the pandemic last year: Source - the caveat is of course that mileage and car use will absolutely pick up as the pandemic ebbs and flows and eventually ends 22.7% of employed Americans were working from home in September due to the pandemic and in management/professional occupations that number rockets to over 40%: Source When the world emerges from this, office hours and behaviour will never be the same, working-from-home and hybrid ""x days at home and x days in the office"" will become the norm, the pandemic has forced companies and employees to prove they can work just fine from home - and that they have, in many cases exceeded expectations.

Do you really think all these people who have picked up recipe box subscriptions, online grocery shopping, at home spin/peloton classes and more will revert back to the old way pre-pandemic?

Cons/Watch Outs The move to hybrid or work-from-home models may not be adopted as much as we think post-pandemic - personally I don't think this will be an issue because 1) I just cannot see a world where businesses don't adapt to this, it ultimately saves them money and 2) this business model is not built on a pandemic, as I said COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to drive adoption and awareness. The insurance goliaths (i.e. Geico) develop or market their own pay-per-mile model (I am not based in the U.S. so any additional insight in the comments from you guys is welcome, let's make this a discussion) - I don't see this happening any time soon, at least, not to the same complexity that $MILE are achieving, it would require huge investment and development to build anything near what $MILE have but you can't rule Buffet/Geico out Someone like Lemonade expand into the motor/pay-per-mile sector Root create a pay-per-mile model (unlikely imo due to their entire business being based on quoting your behaviour but you cant rule it out) Targeting infrequent drivers is a bit of a niche however this can also be viewed as a positive as they are set to dominate said niche For whatever reason, they do not expand to as many states as quickly as they desire, I will not pretend to understand what potential red tape is there The forecasted profits are from their investor deck so they are of course going to big themselves up, regardless I like what I see Wrap Up/TLDR ""Buffet had Geico.

Full disclosure, the below are all excerpts taken from MetroMile's website and not my words, but they looks impressive. CEO Dan Preston: Joined Metromile in 2013 as Chief Technology Officer before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Under his leadership, Metromile has experienced significant policy, premium and employee growth. The company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios. Metromile has been voted a Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and the Phoenix Business Journal. Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and CTO of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. He has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics, remote sensing, and computer vision.Dan holds a master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision from Stanford University and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, where he received the Michtom Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science and graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors in Computer Science. CTO Paw Andersen: A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber's Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies. And then Founder & Chairman David Friedberg, the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki, the NY Post and Linkedin: Former Google employee. The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1B sale to Monsanto in 2013. The Climate Corporation (now known as Climate Field View) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields. From nitrogen levels in soil from historical weather, to satellite imagery mapping out crop health & vegetation maps, it uses data science to make farming better. This guys knows his shit and has a wealth of experience in big data. Expansion, Opportunity and Catalysts They are currently operational in just 8 of 50 U.S. states; Washington, California, Oregon, Illinois, Arizona, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. They plan to be live in 21 states in 2021 and 49 in 2022 Those current 8 states represent 45m potential drivers that can save with MetroMile, that number jumps to 143m drivers in 2022 (with 49 states) representing $160B in potential premiums (seriously, if you look at one thing in that investor deck I linked, jump to slide 30) The IPO transaction has provided an estimated $294 Million in cash to pursue growth opportunities They are looking to expand and cross sell into other verticals such as; Homeowners, Renters, Pet, Warranties & Maintenance through 2021-2022 They are licensing their leading AI claims platform and cannot be just viewed as an auto insurance provider (more on that below) They are integrating and partnering with car manufacturers to refer customers, 2 are already signed up and one of them is FORD, they expect 8 by 2022 so keep an eye out for announcements There are ambitions to go global In December they provided a Q3 earnings update and 2020 forecast exceeding expectations (Source), we should be due Q4/2020 final numbers soon NOT just an insurance provider - FinTech LICENSING Growth This one is important and needs attention - you know that leading, sophisticated, claims AI platform they've built? They are now LICENSING that through their MetroMile ENTERPRISE arm of the business, and its built to work on top of standard claims management software. This licensing delivered $5.6m additional revenue in 2020 and is forecast to increase significantly YoY ($12.4m in 2021 > $21.7m 2022 > $33.7m in 2023 > $48.3m in 2024) - you cannot just look at $MILE as an insurance disruptor, they are also a software/technology company It seems they are not allowed to name everyone who is using their Enterprise tech at this time but do list Tokio Marine, a ""Top 10 US Carrier"" and a ""US Carrier"". They say they have 4 deployed, 22 planned by 2022 and 46 in the pipeline. What about the competition? On a technology level, the closest form of competition I can see is Root, however their USP is that they quote you based on your driving behaviour. It utilises machine learning and an app that analyses your driving before pricing you up. MetroMile does the opposite, it does not charge you at all based on your behaviour, it is per mile. Lemonade could also be classed as a competitor but they focus on the home/rental vertical. On a business model level, Mile Wise (from All State) is the closest, they are also using a pay-per-mile model but lack the same depth of tech behind them compared to $MILE from what I can see.

Do you really think all these people who have picked up recipe box subscriptions, online grocery shopping, at home spin/peloton classes and more will revert back to the old way pre-pandemic?

Cons/Watch Outs The move to hybrid or work-from-home models may not be adopted as much as we think post-pandemic - personally I don't think this will be an issue because 1) I just cannot see a world where businesses don't adapt to this, it ultimately saves them money and 2) this business model is not built on a pandemic, as I said COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to drive adoption and awareness. The insurance goliaths (i.e. Geico) develop or market their own pay-per-mile model (I am not based in the U.S. so any additional insight in the comments from you guys is welcome, let's make this a discussion) - I don't see this happening any time soon, at least, not to the same complexity that $MILE are achieving, it would require huge investment and development to build anything near what $MILE have but you can't rule Buffet/Geico out Someone like Lemonade expand into the motor/pay-per-mile sector Root create a pay-per-mile model (unlikely imo due to their entire business being based on quoting your behaviour but you cant rule it out) Targeting infrequent drivers is a bit of a niche however this can also be viewed as a positive as they are set to dominate said niche For whatever reason, they do not expand to as many states as quickly as they desire, I will not pretend to understand what potential red tape is there The forecasted profits are from their investor deck so they are of course going to big themselves up, regardless I like what I see Wrap Up/TLDR ""Buffet had Geico.

Full disclosure, the below are all excerpts taken from MetroMile's website and not my words, but they looks impressive. CEO Dan Preston: Joined Metromile in 2013 as Chief Technology Officer before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Under his leadership, Metromile has experienced significant policy, premium and employee growth. The company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios. Metromile has been voted a Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and the Phoenix Business Journal. Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and CTO of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. He has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics, remote sensing, and computer vision.Dan holds a master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision from Stanford University and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, where he received the Michtom Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science and graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors in Computer Science. CTO Paw Andersen: A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber's Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies. And then Founder & Chairman David Friedberg, the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki, the NY Post and Linkedin: Former Google employee. The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1B sale to Monsanto in 2013. The Climate Corporation (now known as Climate Field View) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields. From nitrogen levels in soil from historical weather, to satellite imagery mapping out crop health & vegetation maps, it uses data science to make farming better. This guys knows his shit and has a wealth of experience in big data. Expansion, Opportunity and Catalysts They are currently operational in just 8 of 50 U.S. states; Washington, California, Oregon, Illinois, Arizona, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. They plan to be live in 21 states in 2021 and 49 in 2022 Those current 8 states represent 45m potential drivers that can save with MetroMile, that number jumps to 143m drivers in 2022 (with 49 states) representing $160B in potential premiums (seriously, if you look at one thing in that investor deck I linked, jump to slide 30) The IPO transaction has provided an estimated $294 Million in cash to pursue growth opportunities They are looking to expand and cross sell into other verticals such as; Homeowners, Renters, Pet, Warranties & Maintenance through 2021-2022 They are licensing their leading AI claims platform and cannot be just viewed as an auto insurance provider (more on that below) They are integrating and partnering with car manufacturers to refer customers, 2 are already signed up and one of them is FORD, they expect 8 by 2022 so keep an eye out for announcements There are ambitions to go global In December they provided a Q3 earnings update and 2020 forecast exceeding expectations (Source), we should be due Q4/2020 final numbers soon NOT just an insurance provider - FinTech LICENSING Growth This one is important and needs attention - you know that leading, sophisticated, claims AI platform they've built? They are now LICENSING that through their MetroMile ENTERPRISE arm of the business, and its built to work on top of standard claims management software. This licensing delivered $5.6m additional revenue in 2020 and is forecast to increase significantly YoY ($12.4m in 2021 > $21.7m 2022 > $33.7m in 2023 > $48.3m in 2024) - you cannot just look at $MILE as an insurance disruptor, they are also a software/technology company It seems they are not allowed to name everyone who is using their Enterprise tech at this time but do list Tokio Marine, a ""Top 10 US Carrier"" and a ""US Carrier"". They say they have 4 deployed, 22 planned by 2022 and 46 in the pipeline. What about the competition? On a technology level, the closest form of competition I can see is Root, however their USP is that they quote you based on your driving behaviour. It utilises machine learning and an app that analyses your driving before pricing you up. MetroMile does the opposite, it does not charge you at all based on your behaviour, it is per mile. Lemonade could also be classed as a competitor but they focus on the home/rental vertical. On a business model level, Mile Wise (from All State) is the closest, they are also using a pay-per-mile model but lack the same depth of tech behind them compared to $MILE from what I can see. The world and our habits have changed, $MILE are poised to grab that by the horns A pandemic riddled world has seen hundreds of millions of people driving less and burning cash on insured vehicles sitting on their drive ways unused - myself included In the UK, at the height of the pandemic last year only 22% of cars were on the road (Source), that's a whopping 78% decrease and that is not even taking into account that the 22% on the road were likely driving less than usual (YES...I understand $MILE is a U.S. company, unfortunately I could not find any U.S. equivalent data but it's still a relevant stat no doubt replicated to varying degrees throughout the world) A survey shows after the pandemic 25% of drivers plan to drive less: Source (sorry, another UK source I know but I couldn't find similar for the U.S., this is a generalisation of the western world but again as above it will be replicated no doubt to varying degrees) OK...so as I was typing I found this which shows US mileage dropped by as much as 60% during the height of the pandemic last year: Source - the caveat is of course that mileage and car use will absolutely pick up as the pandemic ebbs and flows and eventually ends 22.7% of employed Americans were working from home in September due to the pandemic and in management/professional occupations that number rockets to over 40%: Source When the world emerges from this, office hours and behaviour will never be the same, working-from-home and hybrid ""x days at home and x days in the office"" will become the norm, the pandemic has forced companies and employees to prove they can work just fine from home - and that they have, in many cases exceeded expectations. Before the pandemic was a thing there was STILL a clear need for this in the market, this was always going to be an appealing and great model, COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to bring $MILE to the forefront quicker. Ready to expand. Do you really think all these people who have picked up recipe box subscriptions, online grocery shopping, at home spin/peloton classes and more will revert back to the old way pre-pandemic? Some may, but most will not. People like convenience and ease of use. New habits will stay. Cons/Watch Outs The move to hybrid or work-from-home models may not be adopted as much as we think post-pandemic - personally I don't think this will be an issue because 1) I just cannot see a world where businesses don't adapt to this, it ultimately saves them money and 2) this business model is not built on a pandemic, as I said COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to drive adoption and awareness. The insurance goliaths (i.e. Geico) develop or market their own pay-per-mile model (I am not based in the U.S. so any additional insight in the comments from you guys is welcome, let's make this a discussion) - I don't see this happening any time soon, at least, not to the same complexity that $MILE are achieving, it would require huge investment and development to build anything near what $MILE have but you can't rule Buffet/Geico out Someone like Lemonade expand into the motor/pay-per-mile sector Root create a pay-per-mile model (unlikely imo due to their entire business being based on quoting your behaviour but you cant rule it out) Targeting infrequent drivers is a bit of a niche however this can also be viewed as a positive as they are set to dominate said niche For whatever reason, they do not expand to as many states as quickly as they desire, I will not pretend to understand what potential red tape is there The forecasted profits are from their investor deck so they are of course going to big themselves up, regardless I like what I see Wrap Up/TLDR ""Buffet had Geico.

Longer description from MM themselves: Metromile is a leading pay-per-mile car insurance company in the U.S. Recognized by Forrester as a top insurance carrier in user experience, it is creating a loyal community of drivers with personalized insurance that is customized to each driver to be more affordable. Powered by machine learning and customer-centric design, Metromile is at the forefront of disrupting a more than $250 billion personal auto insurance industry that has gone unchanged for decades. Through Metromile Enterprise, our software-as-a-service business group, we license our proprietary artificial intelligence claims platform to automate claims, reduce losses associated with fraud, and unlock the productivity of insurance carriers’ employees so they can work on higher-impact experiences. We’re a diverse team that combines Silicon Valley’s best technologists with veterans from Fortune 500 insurers and financial service institutions. This approach ensures that we’re as equally focused on loss ratios, unit economics and profitability as on customer experience and technology innovation. Market disrupting InsureTech, driven by AI, machine learning and a strong focus on transparency and user experience - why does that sound familiar? That's right. When life gives you lemons, you make a disruptive AI based home/rental insurance company called LEMONADE that has blasted off to $163 a share.

CTO Paw Andersen: A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber's Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies. And then Founder & Chairman David Friedberg, the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki, the NY Post and Linkedin: Former Google employee. The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1B sale to Monsanto in 2013. The Climate Corporation (now known as Climate Field View) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields. From nitrogen levels in soil from historical weather, to satellite imagery mapping out crop health & vegetation maps, it uses data science to make farming better. This guys knows his shit and has a wealth of experience in big data. Expansion, Opportunity and Catalysts They are currently operational in just 8 of 50 U.S. states; Washington, California, Oregon, Illinois, Arizona, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. They plan to be live in 21 states in 2021 and 49 in 2022 Those current 8 states represent 45m potential drivers that can save with MetroMile, that number jumps to 143m drivers in 2022 (with 49 states) representing $160B in potential premiums (seriously, if you look at one thing in that investor deck I linked, jump to slide 30) The IPO transaction has provided an estimated $294 Million in cash to pursue growth opportunities They are looking to expand and cross sell into other verticals such as; Homeowners, Renters, Pet, Warranties & Maintenance through 2021-2022 They are licensing their leading AI claims platform and cannot be just viewed as an auto insurance provider (more on that below) They are integrating and partnering with car manufacturers to refer customers, 2 are already signed up and one of them is FORD, they expect 8 by 2022 so keep an eye out for announcements There are ambitions to go global In December they provided a Q3 earnings update and 2020 forecast exceeding expectations (Source), we should be due Q4/2020 final numbers soon NOT just an insurance provider - FinTech LICENSING Growth This one is important and needs attention - you know that leading, sophisticated, claims AI platform they've built? They are now LICENSING that through their MetroMile ENTERPRISE arm of the business, and its built to work on top of standard claims management software. This licensing delivered $5.6m additional revenue in 2020 and is forecast to increase significantly YoY ($12.4m in 2021 > $21.7m 2022 > $33.7m in 2023 > $48.3m in 2024) - you cannot just look at $MILE as an insurance disruptor, they are also a software/technology company It seems they are not allowed to name everyone who is using their Enterprise tech at this time but do list Tokio Marine, a ""Top 10 US Carrier"" and a ""US Carrier"". They say they have 4 deployed, 22 planned by 2022 and 46 in the pipeline. What about the competition? On a technology level, the closest form of competition I can see is Root, however their USP is that they quote you based on your driving behaviour. It utilises machine learning and an app that analyses your driving before pricing you up. MetroMile does the opposite, it does not charge you at all based on your behaviour, it is per mile. Lemonade could also be classed as a competitor but they focus on the home/rental vertical. On a business model level, Mile Wise (from All State) is the closest, they are also using a pay-per-mile model but lack the same depth of tech behind them compared to $MILE from what I can see. The world and our habits have changed, $MILE are poised to grab that by the horns A pandemic riddled world has seen hundreds of millions of people driving less and burning cash on insured vehicles sitting on their drive ways unused - myself included In the UK, at the height of the pandemic last year only 22% of cars were on the road (Source), that's a whopping 78% decrease and that is not even taking into account that the 22% on the road were likely driving less than usual (YES...I understand $MILE is a U.S. company, unfortunately I could not find any U.S. equivalent data but it's still a relevant stat no doubt replicated to varying degrees throughout the world) A survey shows after the pandemic 25% of drivers plan to drive less: Source (sorry, another UK source I know but I couldn't find similar for the U.S., this is a generalisation of the western world but again as above it will be replicated no doubt to varying degrees) OK...so as I was typing I found this which shows US mileage dropped by as much as 60% during the height of the pandemic last year: Source - the caveat is of course that mileage and car use will absolutely pick up as the pandemic ebbs and flows and eventually ends 22.7% of employed Americans were working from home in September due to the pandemic and in management/professional occupations that number rockets to over 40%: Source When the world emerges from this, office hours and behaviour will never be the same, working-from-home and hybrid ""x days at home and x days in the office"" will become the norm, the pandemic has forced companies and employees to prove they can work just fine from home - and that they have, in many cases exceeded expectations.

Ready to expand. Do you really think all these people who have picked up recipe box subscriptions, online grocery shopping, at home spin/peloton classes and more will revert back to the old way pre-pandemic? Some may, but most will not. People like convenience and ease of use. New habits will stay. Cons/Watch Outs The move to hybrid or work-from-home models may not be adopted as much as we think post-pandemic - personally I don't think this will be an issue because 1) I just cannot see a world where businesses don't adapt to this, it ultimately saves them money and 2) this business model is not built on a pandemic, as I said COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to drive adoption and awareness. The insurance goliaths (i.e. Geico) develop or market their own pay-per-mile model (I am not based in the U.S. so any additional insight in the comments from you guys is welcome, let's make this a discussion) - I don't see this happening any time soon, at least, not to the same complexity that $MILE are achieving, it would require huge investment and development to build anything near what $MILE have but you can't rule Buffet/Geico out Someone like Lemonade expand into the motor/pay-per-mile sector Root create a pay-per-mile model (unlikely imo due to their entire business being based on quoting your behaviour but you cant rule it out) Targeting infrequent drivers is a bit of a niche however this can also be viewed as a positive as they are set to dominate said niche For whatever reason, they do not expand to as many states as quickly as they desire, I will not pretend to understand what potential red tape is there The forecasted profits are from their investor deck so they are of course going to big themselves up, regardless I like what I see Wrap Up/TLDR ""Buffet had Geico.

On a technology level, the closest form of competition I can see is Root, however their USP is that they quote you based on your driving behaviour. It utilises machine learning and an app that analyses your driving before pricing you up. MetroMile does the opposite, it does not charge you at all based on your behaviour, it is per mile. Lemonade could also be classed as a competitor but they focus on the home/rental vertical.

CEO Dan Preston: Joined Metromile in 2013 as Chief Technology Officer before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Under his leadership, Metromile has experienced significant policy, premium and employee growth. The company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios.

For a while Tesla had major parts supply limitations and they require that the vehicle be repaired in an authorized Tesla repair shop (Tesla won't sell parts to anyone else to my knowledge), which even now aren't exactly abundant. It wasn't uncommon for minor damage on a Tesla to result in it being ""totaled"" because a repair wasn't feasible in a reasonable time frame (plus the debacle of whether or not software like FSD is covered).Even when the car can be repaired, add in longer wait times than the industry norm to receive parts (during which the insurer might be paying for some or all of your rental car expenses), plus the debacle of whether or not FSD is covered—the software is licensed to the car, not the owner, so it won't port to a new vehicle—and you have a disaster from an insurer's perspective. I imagine this is why Tesla offers its own insurance (easier to handle everything in-house). Aside from my last hypothesis, none of this is speculation (I'm a former actuarial analyst).",1,0.522,NEGATIVE,1.0

Premiums are higher on new makes and models because insurers have a certain level of uncertainty around cost of repairs and replacement parts. That is 100% accurate.Tesla insurance can offer better rates due to that knowledge but they also know how I drive.so metromile has been the best cost for me.They also have (or were going to have) a service that plugged into your Turo calendar so you wouldnt get charged for miles while your car was booked and insured under the renters insurance with Turo.Insurance is a brand and a product. I like MMs brand and product.As an investor I like them because they are so small. A lot of runway ahead of them.

On a technology level, the closest form of competition I can see is Root, however their USP is that they quote you based on your driving behaviour.

Full disclosure, the below are all excerpts taken from MetroMile's website and not my words, but they looks impressive. CEO Dan Preston: Joined Metromile in 2013 as Chief Technology Officer before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Under his leadership, Metromile has experienced significant policy, premium and employee growth. The company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios. Metromile has been voted a Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and the Phoenix Business Journal. Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and CTO of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. He has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics, remote sensing, and computer vision.Dan holds a master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision from Stanford University and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, where he received the Michtom Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science and graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors in Computer Science. CTO Paw Andersen: A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber's Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies. And then Founder & Chairman David Friedberg, the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki, the NY Post and Linkedin: Former Google employee. The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1B sale to Monsanto in 2013. The Climate Corporation (now known as Climate Field View) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields.

On a technology level, the closest form of competition I can see is Root, however their USP is that they quote you based on your driving behaviour.

Powered by machine learning and customer-centric design, Metromile is at the forefront of disrupting a more than $250 billion personal auto insurance industry that has gone unchanged for decades. Through Metromile Enterprise, our software-as-a-service business group, we license our proprietary artificial intelligence claims platform to automate claims, reduce losses associated with fraud, and unlock the productivity of insurance carriers’ employees so they can work on higher-impact experiences.

Full disclosure, the below are all excerpts taken from MetroMile's website and not my words, but they looks impressive. CEO Dan Preston: Joined Metromile in 2013 as Chief Technology Officer before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Under his leadership, Metromile has experienced significant policy, premium and employee growth. The company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios. Metromile has been voted a Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and the Phoenix Business Journal. Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and CTO of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. He has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics, remote sensing, and computer vision.Dan holds a master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision from Stanford University and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, where he received the Michtom Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science and graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors in Computer Science. CTO Paw Andersen: A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber's Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies. And then Founder & Chairman David Friedberg, the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki, the NY Post and Linkedin: Former Google employee. The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1B sale to Monsanto in 2013. The Climate Corporation (now known as Climate Field View) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields. From nitrogen levels in soil from historical weather, to satellite imagery mapping out crop health & vegetation maps, it uses data science to make farming better.

Full disclosure, the below are all excerpts taken from MetroMile's website and not my words, but they looks impressive. CEO Dan Preston: Joined Metromile in 2013 as Chief Technology Officer before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Under his leadership, Metromile has experienced significant policy, premium and employee growth. The company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios. Metromile has been voted a Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and the Phoenix Business Journal. Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and CTO of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. He has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics, remote sensing, and computer vision.Dan holds a master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision from Stanford University and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, where he received the Michtom Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science and graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors in Computer Science. CTO Paw Andersen: A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber's Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies. And then Founder & Chairman David Friedberg, the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki, the NY Post and Linkedin: Former Google employee. The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1B sale to Monsanto in 2013. The Climate Corporation (now known as Climate Field View) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields. From nitrogen levels in soil from historical weather, to satellite imagery mapping out crop health & vegetation maps, it uses data science to make farming better.

Full disclosure, the below are all excerpts taken from MetroMile's website and not my words, but they looks impressive. CEO Dan Preston: Joined Metromile in 2013 as Chief Technology Officer before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Under his leadership, Metromile has experienced significant policy, premium and employee growth. The company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios. Metromile has been voted a Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and the Phoenix Business Journal. Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and CTO of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. He has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics, remote sensing, and computer vision.Dan holds a master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision from Stanford University and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, where he received the Michtom Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science and graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors in Computer Science. CTO Paw Andersen: A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber's Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies. And then Founder & Chairman David Friedberg, the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki, the NY Post and Linkedin: Former Google employee. The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1B sale to Monsanto in 2013. The Climate Corporation (now known as Climate Field View) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields. From nitrogen levels in soil from historical weather, to satellite imagery mapping out crop health & vegetation maps, it uses data science to make farming better. This guys knows his shit and has a wealth of experience in big data. Expansion, Opportunity and Catalysts They are currently operational in just 8 of 50 U.S. states; Washington, California, Oregon, Illinois, Arizona, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. They plan to be live in 21 states in 2021 and 49 in 2022 Those current 8 states represent 45m potential drivers that can save with MetroMile, that number jumps to 143m drivers in 2022 (with 49 states) representing $160B in potential premiums (seriously, if you look at one thing in that investor deck I linked, jump to slide 30) The IPO transaction has provided an estimated $294 Million in cash to pursue growth opportunities They are looking to expand and cross sell into other verticals such as; Homeowners, Renters, Pet, Warranties & Maintenance through 2021-2022 They are licensing their leading AI claims platform and cannot be just viewed as an auto insurance provider (more on that below) They are integrating and partnering with car manufacturers to refer customers, 2 are already signed up and one of them is FORD, they expect 8 by 2022 so keep an eye out for announcements There are ambitions to go global In December they provided a Q3 earnings update and 2020 forecast exceeding expectations (Source), we should be due Q4/2020 final numbers soon NOT just an insurance provider - FinTech LICENSING Growth This one is important and needs attention - you know that leading, sophisticated, claims AI platform they've built? They are now LICENSING that through their MetroMile ENTERPRISE arm of the business, and its built to work on top of standard claims management software. This licensing delivered $5.6m additional revenue in 2020 and is forecast to increase significantly YoY ($12.4m in 2021 > $21.7m 2022 > $33.7m in 2023 > $48.3m in 2024) - you cannot just look at $MILE as an insurance disruptor, they are also a software/technology company It seems they are not allowed to name everyone who is using their Enterprise tech at this time but do list Tokio Marine, a ""Top 10 US Carrier"" and a ""US Carrier"". They say they have 4 deployed, 22 planned by 2022 and 46 in the pipeline. What about the competition? On a technology level, the closest form of competition I can see is Root, however their USP is that they quote you based on your driving behaviour. It utilises machine learning and an app that analyses your driving before pricing you up. MetroMile does the opposite, it does not charge you at all based on your behaviour, it is per mile.

Quick explanation: MetroMile are a digital pay-per-mile insurance company that are starting to massively disrupt the market with a strong focus on AI, machine learning and user experience. Longer description from MM themselves: Metromile is a leading pay-per-mile car insurance company in the U.S. Recognized by Forrester as a top insurance carrier in user experience, it is creating a loyal community of drivers with personalized insurance that is customized to each driver to be more affordable. Powered by machine learning and customer-centric design, Metromile is at the forefront of disrupting a more than $250 billion personal auto insurance industry that has gone unchanged for decades. Through Metromile Enterprise, our software-as-a-service business group, we license our proprietary artificial intelligence claims platform to automate claims, reduce losses associated with fraud, and unlock the productivity of insurance carriers’ employees so they can work on higher-impact experiences. We’re a diverse team that combines Silicon Valley’s best technologists with veterans from Fortune 500 insurers and financial service institutions. This approach ensures that we’re as equally focused on loss ratios, unit economics and profitability as on customer experience and technology innovation. Market disrupting InsureTech, driven by AI, machine learning and a strong focus on transparency and user experience - why does that sound familiar? That's right. When life gives you lemons, you make a disruptive AI based home/rental insurance company called LEMONADE that has blasted off to $163 a share. And when life gives you Lemonade, you take that model and apply it to the pay-per-mile car insurance market. ""Buffet had Geico.

Full disclosure, the below are all excerpts taken from MetroMile's website and not my words, but they looks impressive. CEO Dan Preston: Joined Metromile in 2013 as Chief Technology Officer before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Under his leadership, Metromile has experienced significant policy, premium and employee growth. The company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios. Metromile has been voted a Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and the Phoenix Business Journal. Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and CTO of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. He has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics, remote sensing, and computer vision.Dan holds a master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision from Stanford University and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, where he received the Michtom Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science and graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors in Computer Science. CTO Paw Andersen: A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber's Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies. And then Founder & Chairman David Friedberg, the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki, the NY Post and Linkedin: Former Google employee. The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1B sale to Monsanto in 2013. The Climate Corporation (now known as Climate Field View) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields. From nitrogen levels in soil from historical weather, to satellite imagery mapping out crop health & vegetation maps, it uses data science to make farming better. This guys knows his shit and has a wealth of experience in big data. Expansion, Opportunity and Catalysts They are currently operational in just 8 of 50 U.S. states; Washington, California, Oregon, Illinois, Arizona, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. They plan to be live in 21 states in 2021 and 49 in 2022 Those current 8 states represent 45m potential drivers that can save with MetroMile, that number jumps to 143m drivers in 2022 (with 49 states) representing $160B in potential premiums (seriously, if you look at one thing in that investor deck I linked, jump to slide 30) The IPO transaction has provided an estimated $294 Million in cash to pursue growth opportunities They are looking to expand and cross sell into other verticals such as; Homeowners, Renters, Pet, Warranties & Maintenance through 2021-2022 They are licensing their leading AI claims platform and cannot be just viewed as an auto insurance provider (more on that below) They are integrating and partnering with car manufacturers to refer customers, 2 are already signed up and one of them is FORD, they expect 8 by 2022 so keep an eye out for announcements There are ambitions to go global In December they provided a Q3 earnings update and 2020 forecast exceeding expectations (Source), we should be due Q4/2020 final numbers soon NOT just an insurance provider - FinTech LICENSING Growth This one is important and needs attention - you know that leading, sophisticated, claims AI platform they've built? They are now LICENSING that through their MetroMile ENTERPRISE arm of the business, and its built to work on top of standard claims management software. This licensing delivered $5.6m additional revenue in 2020 and is forecast to increase significantly YoY ($12.4m in 2021 > $21.7m 2022 > $33.7m in 2023 > $48.3m in 2024) - you cannot just look at $MILE as an insurance disruptor, they are also a software/technology company It seems they are not allowed to name everyone who is using their Enterprise tech at this time but do list Tokio Marine, a ""Top 10 US Carrier"" and a ""US Carrier"". They say they have 4 deployed, 22 planned by 2022 and 46 in the pipeline. What about the competition? On a technology level, the closest form of competition I can see is Root, however their USP is that they quote you based on your driving behaviour. It utilises machine learning and an app that analyses your driving before pricing you up. MetroMile does the opposite, it does not charge you at all based on your behaviour, it is per mile. Lemonade could also be classed as a competitor but they focus on the home/rental vertical. On a business model level, Mile Wise (from All State) is the closest, they are also using a pay-per-mile model but lack the same depth of tech behind them compared to $MILE from what I can see.

Quick explanation: MetroMile are a digital pay-per-mile insurance company that are starting to massively disrupt the market with a strong focus on AI, machine learning and user experience. Longer description from MM themselves: Metromile is a leading pay-per-mile car insurance company in the U.S. Recognized by Forrester as a top insurance carrier in user experience, it is creating a loyal community of drivers with personalized insurance that is customized to each driver to be more affordable. Powered by machine learning and customer-centric design, Metromile is at the forefront of disrupting a more than $250 billion personal auto insurance industry that has gone unchanged for decades. Through Metromile Enterprise, our software-as-a-service business group, we license our proprietary artificial intelligence claims platform to automate claims, reduce losses associated with fraud, and unlock the productivity of insurance carriers’ employees so they can work on higher-impact experiences. We’re a diverse team that combines Silicon Valley’s best technologists with veterans from Fortune 500 insurers and financial service institutions. This approach ensures that we’re as equally focused on loss ratios, unit economics and profitability as on customer experience and technology innovation. Market disrupting InsureTech, driven by AI, machine learning and a strong focus on transparency and user experience - why does that sound familiar? That's right. When life gives you lemons, you make a disruptive AI based home/rental insurance company called LEMONADE that has blasted off to $163 a share.

Full disclosure, the below are all excerpts taken from MetroMile's website and not my words, but they looks impressive. CEO Dan Preston: Joined Metromile in 2013 as Chief Technology Officer before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Under his leadership, Metromile has experienced significant policy, premium and employee growth. The company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios. Metromile has been voted a Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and the Phoenix Business Journal. Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and CTO of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. He has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics, remote sensing, and computer vision.Dan holds a master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision from Stanford University and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, where he received the Michtom Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science and graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors in Computer Science. CTO Paw Andersen: A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber's Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies. And then Founder & Chairman David Friedberg, the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki, the NY Post and Linkedin: Former Google employee. The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1B sale to Monsanto in 2013. The Climate Corporation (now known as Climate Field View) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields. From nitrogen levels in soil from historical weather, to satellite imagery mapping out crop health & vegetation maps, it uses data science to make farming better. This guys knows his shit and has a wealth of experience in big data. Expansion, Opportunity and Catalysts They are currently operational in just 8 of 50 U.S. states; Washington, California, Oregon, Illinois, Arizona, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. They plan to be live in 21 states in 2021 and 49 in 2022 Those current 8 states represent 45m potential drivers that can save with MetroMile, that number jumps to 143m drivers in 2022 (with 49 states) representing $160B in potential premiums (seriously, if you look at one thing in that investor deck I linked, jump to slide 30) The IPO transaction has provided an estimated $294 Million in cash to pursue growth opportunities They are looking to expand and cross sell into other verticals such as; Homeowners, Renters, Pet, Warranties & Maintenance through 2021-2022 They are licensing their leading AI claims platform and cannot be just viewed as an auto insurance provider (more on that below) They are integrating and partnering with car manufacturers to refer customers, 2 are already signed up and one of them is FORD, they expect 8 by 2022 so keep an eye out for announcements There are ambitions to go global In December they provided a Q3 earnings update and 2020 forecast exceeding expectations (Source), we should be due Q4/2020 final numbers soon NOT just an insurance provider - FinTech LICENSING Growth This one is important and needs attention - you know that leading, sophisticated, claims AI platform they've built? They are now LICENSING that through their MetroMile ENTERPRISE arm of the business, and its built to work on top of standard claims management software. This licensing delivered $5.6m additional revenue in 2020 and is forecast to increase significantly YoY ($12.4m in 2021 > $21.7m 2022 > $33.7m in 2023 > $48.3m in 2024) - you cannot just look at $MILE as an insurance disruptor, they are also a software/technology company It seems they are not allowed to name everyone who is using their Enterprise tech at this time but do list Tokio Marine, a ""Top 10 US Carrier"" and a ""US Carrier"". They say they have 4 deployed, 22 planned by 2022 and 46 in the pipeline. What about the competition? On a technology level, the closest form of competition I can see is Root, however their USP is that they quote you based on your driving behaviour. It utilises machine learning and an app that analyses your driving before pricing you up. MetroMile does the opposite, it does not charge you at all based on your behaviour, it is per mile. Lemonade could also be classed as a competitor but they focus on the home/rental vertical.

Quick explanation: MetroMile are a digital pay-per-mile insurance company that are starting to massively disrupt the market with a strong focus on AI, machine learning and user experience. Longer description from MM themselves: Metromile is a leading pay-per-mile car insurance company in the U.S. Recognized by Forrester as a top insurance carrier in user experience, it is creating a loyal community of drivers with personalized insurance that is customized to each driver to be more affordable. Powered by machine learning and customer-centric design, Metromile is at the forefront of disrupting a more than $250 billion personal auto insurance industry that has gone unchanged for decades. Through Metromile Enterprise, our software-as-a-service business group, we license our proprietary artificial intelligence claims platform to automate claims, reduce losses associated with fraud, and unlock the productivity of insurance carriers’ employees so they can work on higher-impact experiences. We’re a diverse team that combines Silicon Valley’s best technologists with veterans from Fortune 500 insurers and financial service institutions. This approach ensures that we’re as equally focused on loss ratios, unit economics and profitability as on customer experience and technology innovation. Market disrupting InsureTech, driven by AI, machine learning and a strong focus on transparency and user experience - why does that sound familiar? That's right. When life gives you lemons, you make a disruptive AI based home/rental insurance company called LEMONADE that has blasted off to $163 a share.

Full disclosure, the below are all excerpts taken from MetroMile's website and not my words, but they looks impressive. CEO Dan Preston: Joined Metromile in 2013 as Chief Technology Officer before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Under his leadership, Metromile has experienced significant policy, premium and employee growth. The company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios. Metromile has been voted a Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and the Phoenix Business Journal. Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and CTO of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. He has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics, remote sensing, and computer vision.Dan holds a master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision from Stanford University and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, where he received the Michtom Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science and graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors in Computer Science. CTO Paw Andersen: A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber's Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies. And then Founder & Chairman David Friedberg, the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki, the NY Post and Linkedin: Former Google employee. The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1B sale to Monsanto in 2013. The Climate Corporation (now known as Climate Field View) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields. From nitrogen levels in soil from historical weather, to satellite imagery mapping out crop health & vegetation maps, it uses data science to make farming better. This guys knows his shit and has a wealth of experience in big data. Expansion, Opportunity and Catalysts They are currently operational in just 8 of 50 U.S. states; Washington, California, Oregon, Illinois, Arizona, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. They plan to be live in 21 states in 2021 and 49 in 2022 Those current 8 states represent 45m potential drivers that can save with MetroMile, that number jumps to 143m drivers in 2022 (with 49 states) representing $160B in potential premiums (seriously, if you look at one thing in that investor deck I linked, jump to slide 30) The IPO transaction has provided an estimated $294 Million in cash to pursue growth opportunities They are looking to expand and cross sell into other verticals such as; Homeowners, Renters, Pet, Warranties & Maintenance through 2021-2022 They are licensing their leading AI claims platform and cannot be just viewed as an auto insurance provider (more on that below) They are integrating and partnering with car manufacturers to refer customers, 2 are already signed up and one of them is FORD, they expect 8 by 2022 so keep an eye out for announcements There are ambitions to go global In December they provided a Q3 earnings update and 2020 forecast exceeding expectations (Source), we should be due Q4/2020 final numbers soon NOT just an insurance provider - FinTech LICENSING Growth This one is important and needs attention - you know that leading, sophisticated, claims AI platform they've built? They are now LICENSING that through their MetroMile ENTERPRISE arm of the business, and its built to work on top of standard claims management software. This licensing delivered $5.6m additional revenue in 2020 and is forecast to increase significantly YoY ($12.4m in 2021 > $21.7m 2022 > $33.7m in 2023 > $48.3m in 2024) - you cannot just look at $MILE as an insurance disruptor, they are also a software/technology company It seems they are not allowed to name everyone who is using their Enterprise tech at this time but do list Tokio Marine, a ""Top 10 US Carrier"" and a ""US Carrier"". They say they have 4 deployed, 22 planned by 2022 and 46 in the pipeline. What about the competition? On a technology level, the closest form of competition I can see is Root, however their USP is that they quote you based on your driving behaviour. It utilises machine learning and an app that analyses your driving before pricing you up. MetroMile does the opposite, it does not charge you at all based on your behaviour, it is per mile. Lemonade could also be classed as a competitor but they focus on the home/rental vertical. On a business model level, Mile Wise (from All State) is the closest, they are also using a pay-per-mile model but lack the same depth of tech behind them compared to $MILE from what I can see.

Cons/Watch Outs The move to hybrid or work-from-home models may not be adopted as much as we think post-pandemic - personally I don't think this will be an issue because 1) I just cannot see a world where businesses don't adapt to this, it ultimately saves them money and 2) this business model is not built on a pandemic, as I said COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to drive adoption and awareness. The insurance goliaths (i.e. Geico) develop or market their own pay-per-mile model (I am not based in the U.S. so any additional insight in the comments from you guys is welcome, let's make this a discussion) - I don't see this happening any time soon, at least, not to the same complexity that $MILE are achieving, it would require huge investment and development to build anything near what $MILE have but you can't rule Buffet/Geico out Someone like Lemonade expand into the motor/pay-per-mile sector Root create a pay-per-mile model (unlikely imo due to their entire business being based on quoting your behaviour but you cant rule it out) Targeting infrequent drivers is a bit of a niche however this can also be viewed as a positive as they are set to dominate said niche For whatever reason, they do not expand to as many states as quickly as they desire, I will not pretend to understand what potential red tape is there The forecasted profits are from their investor deck so they are of course going to big themselves up, regardless I like what I see Wrap Up/TLDR ""Buffet had Geico.

I'm not loyal because I understand insurers' pricing games and am considered a low-risk profile for insurers (good credit score, clean driving record, high education level, professional occupation, not super young or old). Until recently, I switched every 6 months unless I got lazy, and I never went more than a year with a carrier (the recent ""loyalty"" is because I got keyed and then was side swiped by a hit and run driver in less than one year, which would make my rates skyrocket if I switched carriers). That said, if I had a negative experience with a carrier, I would never write a policy with them again.Insurance definitely has very high retention rates compared to other industries, but they have been declining some on average for at least several years and it's a big enough change that insurers are taking notice.",1,0.543,NEGATIVE,1.0

Quick explanation: MetroMile are a digital pay-per-mile insurance company that are starting to massively disrupt the market with a strong focus on AI, machine learning and user experience. Longer description from MM themselves: Metromile is a leading pay-per-mile car insurance company in the U.S. Recognized by Forrester as a top insurance carrier in user experience, it is creating a loyal community of drivers with personalized insurance that is customized to each driver to be more affordable. Powered by machine learning and customer-centric design, Metromile is at the forefront of disrupting a more than $250 billion personal auto insurance industry that has gone unchanged for decades. Through Metromile Enterprise, our software-as-a-service business group, we license our proprietary artificial intelligence claims platform to automate claims, reduce losses associated with fraud, and unlock the productivity of insurance carriers’ employees so they can work on higher-impact experiences. We’re a diverse team that combines Silicon Valley’s best technologists with veterans from Fortune 500 insurers and financial service institutions. This approach ensures that we’re as equally focused on loss ratios, unit economics and profitability as on customer experience and technology innovation. Market disrupting InsureTech, driven by AI, machine learning and a strong focus on transparency and user experience - why does that sound familiar? That's right. When life gives you lemons, you make a disruptive AI based home/rental insurance company called LEMONADE that has blasted off to $163 a share. And when life gives you Lemonade, you take that model and apply it to the pay-per-mile car insurance market. ""Buffet had Geico.

Full disclosure, the below are all excerpts taken from MetroMile's website and not my words, but they looks impressive. CEO Dan Preston: Joined Metromile in 2013 as Chief Technology Officer before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Under his leadership, Metromile has experienced significant policy, premium and employee growth. The company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios. Metromile has been voted a Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and the Phoenix Business Journal. Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and CTO of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. He has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics, remote sensing, and computer vision.Dan holds a master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision from Stanford University and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, where he received the Michtom Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science and graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors in Computer Science. CTO Paw Andersen: A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber's Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies. And then Founder & Chairman David Friedberg, the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki, the NY Post and Linkedin: Former Google employee. The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1B sale to Monsanto in 2013. The Climate Corporation (now known as Climate Field View) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields. From nitrogen levels in soil from historical weather, to satellite imagery mapping out crop health & vegetation maps, it uses data science to make farming better. This guys knows his shit and has a wealth of experience in big data. Expansion, Opportunity and Catalysts They are currently operational in just 8 of 50 U.S. states; Washington, California, Oregon, Illinois, Arizona, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. They plan to be live in 21 states in 2021 and 49 in 2022 Those current 8 states represent 45m potential drivers that can save with MetroMile, that number jumps to 143m drivers in 2022 (with 49 states) representing $160B in potential premiums (seriously, if you look at one thing in that investor deck I linked, jump to slide 30) The IPO transaction has provided an estimated $294 Million in cash to pursue growth opportunities They are looking to expand and cross sell into other verticals such as; Homeowners, Renters, Pet, Warranties & Maintenance through 2021-2022 They are licensing their leading AI claims platform and cannot be just viewed as an auto insurance provider (more on that below) They are integrating and partnering with car manufacturers to refer customers, 2 are already signed up and one of them is FORD, they expect 8 by 2022 so keep an eye out for announcements There are ambitions to go global In December they provided a Q3 earnings update and 2020 forecast exceeding expectations (Source), we should be due Q4/2020 final numbers soon NOT just an insurance provider - FinTech LICENSING Growth This one is important and needs attention - you know that leading, sophisticated, claims AI platform they've built? They are now LICENSING that through their MetroMile ENTERPRISE arm of the business, and its built to work on top of standard claims management software. This licensing delivered $5.6m additional revenue in 2020 and is forecast to increase significantly YoY ($12.4m in 2021 > $21.7m 2022 > $33.7m in 2023 > $48.3m in 2024) - you cannot just look at $MILE as an insurance disruptor, they are also a software/technology company It seems they are not allowed to name everyone who is using their Enterprise tech at this time but do list Tokio Marine, a ""Top 10 US Carrier"" and a ""US Carrier"". They say they have 4 deployed, 22 planned by 2022 and 46 in the pipeline. What about the competition? On a technology level, the closest form of competition I can see is Root, however their USP is that they quote you based on your driving behaviour. It utilises machine learning and an app that analyses your driving before pricing you up. MetroMile does the opposite, it does not charge you at all based on your behaviour, it is per mile. Lemonade could also be classed as a competitor but they focus on the home/rental vertical. On a business model level, Mile Wise (from All State) is the closest, they are also using a pay-per-mile model but lack the same depth of tech behind them compared to $MILE from what I can see. The world and our habits have changed, $MILE are poised to grab that by the horns A pandemic riddled world has seen hundreds of millions of people driving less and burning cash on insured vehicles sitting on their drive ways unused - myself included In the UK, at the height of the pandemic last year only 22% of cars were on the road (Source), that's a whopping 78% decrease and that is not even taking into account that the 22% on the road were likely driving less than usual (YES...I understand $MILE is a U.S. company, unfortunately I could not find any U.S. equivalent data but it's still a relevant stat no doubt replicated to varying degrees throughout the world) A survey shows after the pandemic 25% of drivers plan to drive less: Source (sorry, another UK source I know but I couldn't find similar for the U.S., this is a generalisation of the western world but again as above it will be replicated no doubt to varying degrees) OK...so as I was typing I found this which shows US mileage dropped by as much as 60% during the height of the pandemic last year: Source - the caveat is of course that mileage and car use will absolutely pick up as the pandemic ebbs and flows and eventually ends 22.7% of employed Americans were working from home in September due to the pandemic and in management/professional occupations that number rockets to over 40%: Source When the world emerges from this, office hours and behaviour will never be the same, working-from-home and hybrid ""x days at home and x days in the office"" will become the norm, the pandemic has forced companies and employees to prove they can work just fine from home - and that they have, in many cases exceeded expectations.

Do you really think all these people who have picked up recipe box subscriptions, online grocery shopping, at home spin/peloton classes and more will revert back to the old way pre-pandemic? Some may, but most will not. People like convenience and ease of use. New habits will stay. Cons/Watch Outs The move to hybrid or work-from-home models may not be adopted as much as we think post-pandemic - personally I don't think this will be an issue because 1) I just cannot see a world where businesses don't adapt to this, it ultimately saves them money and 2) this business model is not built on a pandemic, as I said COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to drive adoption and awareness. The insurance goliaths (i.e. Geico) develop or market their own pay-per-mile model (I am not based in the U.S. so any additional insight in the comments from you guys is welcome, let's make this a discussion) - I don't see this happening any time soon, at least, not to the same complexity that $MILE are achieving, it would require huge investment and development to build anything near what $MILE have but you can't rule Buffet/Geico out Someone like Lemonade expand into the motor/pay-per-mile sector Root create a pay-per-mile model (unlikely imo due to their entire business being based on quoting your behaviour but you cant rule it out) Targeting infrequent drivers is a bit of a niche however this can also be viewed as a positive as they are set to dominate said niche For whatever reason, they do not expand to as many states as quickly as they desire, I will not pretend to understand what potential red tape is there The forecasted profits are from their investor deck so they are of course going to big themselves up, regardless I like what I see Wrap Up/TLDR ""Buffet had Geico.

Through Metromile Enterprise, our software-as-a-service business group, we license our proprietary artificial intelligence claims platform to automate claims, reduce losses associated with fraud, and unlock the productivity of insurance carriers’ employees so they can work on higher-impact experiences. We’re a diverse team that combines Silicon Valley’s best technologists with veterans from Fortune 500 insurers and financial service institutions. This approach ensures that we’re as equally focused on loss ratios, unit economics and profitability as on customer experience and technology innovation. Market disrupting InsureTech, driven by AI, machine learning and a strong focus on transparency and user experience - why does that sound familiar? That's right. When life gives you lemons, you make a disruptive AI based home/rental insurance company called LEMONADE that has blasted off to $163 a share. And when life gives you Lemonade, you take that model and apply it to the pay-per-mile car insurance market. ""Buffet had Geico.

Full disclosure, the below are all excerpts taken from MetroMile's website and not my words, but they looks impressive. CEO Dan Preston: Joined Metromile in 2013 as Chief Technology Officer before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Under his leadership, Metromile has experienced significant policy, premium and employee growth. The company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios. Metromile has been voted a Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and the Phoenix Business Journal. Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and CTO of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. He has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics, remote sensing, and computer vision.Dan holds a master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision from Stanford University and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, where he received the Michtom Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science and graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors in Computer Science. CTO Paw Andersen: A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber's Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies. And then Founder & Chairman David Friedberg, the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki, the NY Post and Linkedin: Former Google employee. The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1B sale to Monsanto in 2013. The Climate Corporation (now known as Climate Field View) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields. From nitrogen levels in soil from historical weather, to satellite imagery mapping out crop health & vegetation maps, it uses data science to make farming better. This guys knows his shit and has a wealth of experience in big data. Expansion, Opportunity and Catalysts They are currently operational in just 8 of 50 U.S. states; Washington, California, Oregon, Illinois, Arizona, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. They plan to be live in 21 states in 2021 and 49 in 2022 Those current 8 states represent 45m potential drivers that can save with MetroMile, that number jumps to 143m drivers in 2022 (with 49 states) representing $160B in potential premiums (seriously, if you look at one thing in that investor deck I linked, jump to slide 30) The IPO transaction has provided an estimated $294 Million in cash to pursue growth opportunities They are looking to expand and cross sell into other verticals such as; Homeowners, Renters, Pet, Warranties & Maintenance through 2021-2022 They are licensing their leading AI claims platform and cannot be just viewed as an auto insurance provider (more on that below) They are integrating and partnering with car manufacturers to refer customers, 2 are already signed up and one of them is FORD, they expect 8 by 2022 so keep an eye out for announcements There are ambitions to go global In December they provided a Q3 earnings update and 2020 forecast exceeding expectations (Source), we should be due Q4/2020 final numbers soon NOT just an insurance provider - FinTech LICENSING Growth This one is important and needs attention - you know that leading, sophisticated, claims AI platform they've built? They are now LICENSING that through their MetroMile ENTERPRISE arm of the business, and its built to work on top of standard claims management software. This licensing delivered $5.6m additional revenue in 2020 and is forecast to increase significantly YoY ($12.4m in 2021 > $21.7m 2022 > $33.7m in 2023 > $48.3m in 2024) - you cannot just look at $MILE as an insurance disruptor, they are also a software/technology company It seems they are not allowed to name everyone who is using their Enterprise tech at this time but do list Tokio Marine, a ""Top 10 US Carrier"" and a ""US Carrier"". They say they have 4 deployed, 22 planned by 2022 and 46 in the pipeline. What about the competition? On a technology level, the closest form of competition I can see is Root, however their USP is that they quote you based on your driving behaviour. It utilises machine learning and an app that analyses your driving before pricing you up. MetroMile does the opposite, it does not charge you at all based on your behaviour, it is per mile. Lemonade could also be classed as a competitor but they focus on the home/rental vertical. On a business model level, Mile Wise (from All State) is the closest, they are also using a pay-per-mile model but lack the same depth of tech behind them compared to $MILE from what I can see.

Cons/Watch Outs The move to hybrid or work-from-home models may not be adopted as much as we think post-pandemic - personally I don't think this will be an issue because 1) I just cannot see a world where businesses don't adapt to this, it ultimately saves them money and 2) this business model is not built on a pandemic, as I said COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to drive adoption and awareness. The insurance goliaths (i.e. Geico) develop or market their own pay-per-mile model (I am not based in the U.S. so any additional insight in the comments from you guys is welcome, let's make this a discussion) - I don't see this happening any time soon, at least, not to the same complexity that $MILE are achieving, it would require huge investment and development to build anything near what $MILE have but you can't rule Buffet/Geico out Someone like Lemonade expand into the motor/pay-per-mile sector Root create a pay-per-mile model (unlikely imo due to their entire business being based on quoting your behaviour but you cant rule it out) Targeting infrequent drivers is a bit of a niche however this can also be viewed as a positive as they are set to dominate said niche For whatever reason, they do not expand to as many states as quickly as they desire, I will not pretend to understand what potential red tape is there The forecasted profits are from their investor deck so they are of course going to big themselves up, regardless I like what I see Wrap Up/TLDR ""Buffet had Geico.

Full disclosure, the below are all excerpts taken from MetroMile's website and not my words, but they looks impressive. CEO Dan Preston: Joined Metromile in 2013 as Chief Technology Officer before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Under his leadership, Metromile has experienced significant policy, premium and employee growth. The company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios. Metromile has been voted a Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and the Phoenix Business Journal. Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and CTO of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. He has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics, remote sensing, and computer vision.Dan holds a master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision from Stanford University and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, where he received the Michtom Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science and graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors in Computer Science. CTO Paw Andersen: A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber's Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies. And then Founder & Chairman David Friedberg, the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki, the NY Post and Linkedin: Former Google employee. The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1B sale to Monsanto in 2013. The Climate Corporation (now known as Climate Field View) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields. From nitrogen levels in soil from historical weather, to satellite imagery mapping out crop health & vegetation maps, it uses data science to make farming better. This guys knows his shit and has a wealth of experience in big data. Expansion, Opportunity and Catalysts They are currently operational in just 8 of 50 U.S. states; Washington, California, Oregon, Illinois, Arizona, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. They plan to be live in 21 states in 2021 and 49 in 2022 Those current 8 states represent 45m potential drivers that can save with MetroMile, that number jumps to 143m drivers in 2022 (with 49 states) representing $160B in potential premiums (seriously, if you look at one thing in that investor deck I linked, jump to slide 30) The IPO transaction has provided an estimated $294 Million in cash to pursue growth opportunities They are looking to expand and cross sell into other verticals such as; Homeowners, Renters, Pet, Warranties & Maintenance through 2021-2022 They are licensing their leading AI claims platform and cannot be just viewed as an auto insurance provider (more on that below) They are integrating and partnering with car manufacturers to refer customers, 2 are already signed up and one of them is FORD, they expect 8 by 2022 so keep an eye out for announcements There are ambitions to go global In December they provided a Q3 earnings update and 2020 forecast exceeding expectations (Source), we should be due Q4/2020 final numbers soon NOT just an insurance provider - FinTech LICENSING Growth This one is important and needs attention - you know that leading, sophisticated, claims AI platform they've built? They are now LICENSING that through their MetroMile ENTERPRISE arm of the business, and its built to work on top of standard claims management software. This licensing delivered $5.6m additional revenue in 2020 and is forecast to increase significantly YoY ($12.4m in 2021 > $21.7m 2022 > $33.7m in 2023 > $48.3m in 2024) - you cannot just look at $MILE as an insurance disruptor, they are also a software/technology company It seems they are not allowed to name everyone who is using their Enterprise tech at this time but do list Tokio Marine, a ""Top 10 US Carrier"" and a ""US Carrier"". They say they have 4 deployed, 22 planned by 2022 and 46 in the pipeline. What about the competition? On a technology level, the closest form of competition I can see is Root, however their USP is that they quote you based on your driving behaviour. It utilises machine learning and an app that analyses your driving before pricing you up. MetroMile does the opposite, it does not charge you at all based on your behaviour, it is per mile. Lemonade could also be classed as a competitor but they focus on the home/rental vertical. On a business model level, Mile Wise (from All State) is the closest, they are also using a pay-per-mile model but lack the same depth of tech behind them compared to $MILE from what I can see.

Ready to expand. Do you really think all these people who have picked up recipe box subscriptions, online grocery shopping, at home spin/peloton classes and more will revert back to the old way pre-pandemic? Some may, but most will not. People like convenience and ease of use. New habits will stay. Cons/Watch Outs The move to hybrid or work-from-home models may not be adopted as much as we think post-pandemic - personally I don't think this will be an issue because 1) I just cannot see a world where businesses don't adapt to this, it ultimately saves them money and 2) this business model is not built on a pandemic, as I said COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to drive adoption and awareness. The insurance goliaths (i.e. Geico) develop or market their own pay-per-mile model (I am not based in the U.S. so any additional insight in the comments from you guys is welcome, let's make this a discussion) - I don't see this happening any time soon, at least, not to the same complexity that $MILE are achieving, it would require huge investment and development to build anything near what $MILE have but you can't rule Buffet/Geico out Someone like Lemonade expand into the motor/pay-per-mile sector Root create a pay-per-mile model (unlikely imo due to their entire business being based on quoting your behaviour but you cant rule it out) Targeting infrequent drivers is a bit of a niche however this can also be viewed as a positive as they are set to dominate said niche For whatever reason, they do not expand to as many states as quickly as they desire, I will not pretend to understand what potential red tape is there The forecasted profits are from their investor deck so they are of course going to big themselves up, regardless I like what I see Wrap Up/TLDR ""Buffet had Geico.

Full disclosure, the below are all excerpts taken from MetroMile's website and not my words, but they looks impressive. CEO Dan Preston: Joined Metromile in 2013 as Chief Technology Officer before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Under his leadership, Metromile has experienced significant policy, premium and employee growth. The company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios. Metromile has been voted a Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and the Phoenix Business Journal. Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and CTO of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. He has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics, remote sensing, and computer vision.Dan holds a master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision from Stanford University and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, where he received the Michtom Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science and graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors in Computer Science. CTO Paw Andersen: A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber's Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies. And then Founder & Chairman David Friedberg, the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki, the NY Post and Linkedin: Former Google employee. The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1B sale to Monsanto in 2013. The Climate Corporation (now known as Climate Field View) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields. From nitrogen levels in soil from historical weather, to satellite imagery mapping out crop health & vegetation maps, it uses data science to make farming better. This guys knows his shit and has a wealth of experience in big data. Expansion, Opportunity and Catalysts They are currently operational in just 8 of 50 U.S. states; Washington, California, Oregon, Illinois, Arizona, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. They plan to be live in 21 states in 2021 and 49 in 2022 Those current 8 states represent 45m potential drivers that can save with MetroMile, that number jumps to 143m drivers in 2022 (with 49 states) representing $160B in potential premiums (seriously, if you look at one thing in that investor deck I linked, jump to slide 30) The IPO transaction has provided an estimated $294 Million in cash to pursue growth opportunities They are looking to expand and cross sell into other verticals such as; Homeowners, Renters, Pet, Warranties & Maintenance through 2021-2022 They are licensing their leading AI claims platform and cannot be just viewed as an auto insurance provider (more on that below) They are integrating and partnering with car manufacturers to refer customers, 2 are already signed up and one of them is FORD, they expect 8 by 2022 so keep an eye out for announcements There are ambitions to go global In December they provided a Q3 earnings update and 2020 forecast exceeding expectations (Source), we should be due Q4/2020 final numbers soon NOT just an insurance provider - FinTech LICENSING Growth This one is important and needs attention - you know that leading, sophisticated, claims AI platform they've built? They are now LICENSING that through their MetroMile ENTERPRISE arm of the business, and its built to work on top of standard claims management software. This licensing delivered $5.6m additional revenue in 2020 and is forecast to increase significantly YoY ($12.4m in 2021 > $21.7m 2022 > $33.7m in 2023 > $48.3m in 2024) - you cannot just look at $MILE as an insurance disruptor, they are also a software/technology company It seems they are not allowed to name everyone who is using their Enterprise tech at this time but do list Tokio Marine, a ""Top 10 US Carrier"" and a ""US Carrier"". They say they have 4 deployed, 22 planned by 2022 and 46 in the pipeline. What about the competition? On a technology level, the closest form of competition I can see is Root, however their USP is that they quote you based on your driving behaviour. It utilises machine learning and an app that analyses your driving before pricing you up. MetroMile does the opposite, it does not charge you at all based on your behaviour, it is per mile. Lemonade could also be classed as a competitor but they focus on the home/rental vertical. On a business model level, Mile Wise (from All State) is the closest, they are also using a pay-per-mile model but lack the same depth of tech behind them compared to $MILE from what I can see. The world and our habits have changed, $MILE are poised to grab that by the horns A pandemic riddled world has seen hundreds of millions of people driving less and burning cash on insured vehicles sitting on their drive ways unused - myself included In the UK, at the height of the pandemic last year only 22% of cars were on the road (Source), that's a whopping 78% decrease and that is not even taking into account that the 22% on the road were likely driving less than usual (YES...I understand $MILE is a U.S. company, unfortunately I could not find any U.S. equivalent data but it's still a relevant stat no doubt replicated to varying degrees throughout the world) A survey shows after the pandemic 25% of drivers plan to drive less: Source (sorry, another UK source I know but I couldn't find similar for the U.S., this is a generalisation of the western world but again as above it will be replicated no doubt to varying degrees) OK...so as I was typing I found this which shows US mileage dropped by as much as 60% during the height of the pandemic last year: Source - the caveat is of course that mileage and car use will absolutely pick up as the pandemic ebbs and flows and eventually ends 22.7% of employed Americans were working from home in September due to the pandemic and in management/professional occupations that number rockets to over 40%: Source When the world emerges from this, office hours and behaviour will never be the same, working-from-home and hybrid ""x days at home and x days in the office"" will become the norm, the pandemic has forced companies and employees to prove they can work just fine from home - and that they have, in many cases exceeded expectations. Before the pandemic was a thing there was STILL a clear need for this in the market, this was always going to be an appealing and great model, COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to bring $MILE to the forefront quicker. Ready to expand. Do you really think all these people who have picked up recipe box subscriptions, online grocery shopping, at home spin/peloton classes and more will revert back to the old way pre-pandemic? Some may, but most will not. People like convenience and ease of use. New habits will stay. Cons/Watch Outs The move to hybrid or work-from-home models may not be adopted as much as we think post-pandemic - personally I don't think this will be an issue because 1) I just cannot see a world where businesses don't adapt to this, it ultimately saves them money and 2) this business model is not built on a pandemic, as I said COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to drive adoption and awareness. The insurance goliaths (i.e. Geico) develop or market their own pay-per-mile model (I am not based in the U.S. so any additional insight in the comments from you guys is welcome, let's make this a discussion) - I don't see this happening any time soon, at least, not to the same complexity that $MILE are achieving, it would require huge investment and development to build anything near what $MILE have but you can't rule Buffet/Geico out Someone like Lemonade expand into the motor/pay-per-mile sector Root create a pay-per-mile model (unlikely imo due to their entire business being based on quoting your behaviour but you cant rule it out) Targeting infrequent drivers is a bit of a niche however this can also be viewed as a positive as they are set to dominate said niche For whatever reason, they do not expand to as many states as quickly as they desire, I will not pretend to understand what potential red tape is there The forecasted profits are from their investor deck so they are of course going to big themselves up, regardless I like what I see Wrap Up/TLDR ""Buffet had Geico.

Full disclosure, the below are all excerpts taken from MetroMile's website and not my words, but they looks impressive. CEO Dan Preston: Joined Metromile in 2013 as Chief Technology Officer before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Under his leadership, Metromile has experienced significant policy, premium and employee growth. The company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios. Metromile has been voted a Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and the Phoenix Business Journal. Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and CTO of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. He has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics, remote sensing, and computer vision.Dan holds a master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision from Stanford University and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, where he received the Michtom Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science and graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors in Computer Science. CTO Paw Andersen: A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber's Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies. And then Founder & Chairman David Friedberg, the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki, the NY Post and Linkedin: Former Google employee. The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1B sale to Monsanto in 2013. The Climate Corporation (now known as Climate Field View) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields. From nitrogen levels in soil from historical weather, to satellite imagery mapping out crop health & vegetation maps, it uses data science to make farming better. This guys knows his shit and has a wealth of experience in big data. Expansion, Opportunity and Catalysts They are currently operational in just 8 of 50 U.S. states; Washington, California, Oregon, Illinois, Arizona, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. They plan to be live in 21 states in 2021 and 49 in 2022 Those current 8 states represent 45m potential drivers that can save with MetroMile, that number jumps to 143m drivers in 2022 (with 49 states) representing $160B in potential premiums (seriously, if you look at one thing in that investor deck I linked, jump to slide 30) The IPO transaction has provided an estimated $294 Million in cash to pursue growth opportunities They are looking to expand and cross sell into other verticals such as; Homeowners, Renters, Pet, Warranties & Maintenance through 2021-2022 They are licensing their leading AI claims platform and cannot be just viewed as an auto insurance provider (more on that below) They are integrating and partnering with car manufacturers to refer customers, 2 are already signed up and one of them is FORD, they expect 8 by 2022 so keep an eye out for announcements There are ambitions to go global In December they provided a Q3 earnings update and 2020 forecast exceeding expectations (Source), we should be due Q4/2020 final numbers soon NOT just an insurance provider - FinTech LICENSING Growth This one is important and needs attention - you know that leading, sophisticated, claims AI platform they've built? They are now LICENSING that through their MetroMile ENTERPRISE arm of the business, and its built to work on top of standard claims management software. This licensing delivered $5.6m additional revenue in 2020 and is forecast to increase significantly YoY ($12.4m in 2021 > $21.7m 2022 > $33.7m in 2023 > $48.3m in 2024) - you cannot just look at $MILE as an insurance disruptor, they are also a software/technology company It seems they are not allowed to name everyone who is using their Enterprise tech at this time but do list Tokio Marine, a ""Top 10 US Carrier"" and a ""US Carrier"". They say they have 4 deployed, 22 planned by 2022 and 46 in the pipeline. What about the competition? On a technology level, the closest form of competition I can see is Root, however their USP is that they quote you based on your driving behaviour. It utilises machine learning and an app that analyses your driving before pricing you up. MetroMile does the opposite, it does not charge you at all based on your behaviour, it is per mile. Lemonade could also be classed as a competitor but they focus on the home/rental vertical. On a business model level, Mile Wise (from All State) is the closest, they are also using a pay-per-mile model but lack the same depth of tech behind them compared to $MILE from what I can see. The world and our habits have changed, $MILE are poised to grab that by the horns A pandemic riddled world has seen hundreds of millions of people driving less and burning cash on insured vehicles sitting on their drive ways unused - myself included In the UK, at the height of the pandemic last year only 22% of cars were on the road (Source), that's a whopping 78% decrease and that is not even taking into account that the 22% on the road were likely driving less than usual (YES...I understand $MILE is a U.S. company, unfortunately I could not find any U.S. equivalent data but it's still a relevant stat no doubt replicated to varying degrees throughout the world) A survey shows after the pandemic 25% of drivers plan to drive less: Source (sorry, another UK source I know but I couldn't find similar for the U.S., this is a generalisation of the western world but again as above it will be replicated no doubt to varying degrees) OK...so as I was typing I found this which shows US mileage dropped by as much as 60% during the height of the pandemic last year: Source - the caveat is of course that mileage and car use will absolutely pick up as the pandemic ebbs and flows and eventually ends 22.7% of employed Americans were working from home in September due to the pandemic and in management/professional occupations that number rockets to over 40%: Source When the world emerges from this, office hours and behaviour will never be the same, working-from-home and hybrid ""x days at home and x days in the office"" will become the norm, the pandemic has forced companies and employees to prove they can work just fine from home - and that they have, in many cases exceeded expectations.

Do you really think all these people who have picked up recipe box subscriptions, online grocery shopping, at home spin/peloton classes and more will revert back to the old way pre-pandemic? Some may, but most will not. People like convenience and ease of use. New habits will stay. Cons/Watch Outs The move to hybrid or work-from-home models may not be adopted as much as we think post-pandemic - personally I don't think this will be an issue because 1) I just cannot see a world where businesses don't adapt to this, it ultimately saves them money and 2) this business model is not built on a pandemic, as I said COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to drive adoption and awareness. The insurance goliaths (i.e. Geico) develop or market their own pay-per-mile model (I am not based in the U.S. so any additional insight in the comments from you guys is welcome, let's make this a discussion) - I don't see this happening any time soon, at least, not to the same complexity that $MILE are achieving, it would require huge investment and development to build anything near what $MILE have but you can't rule Buffet/Geico out Someone like Lemonade expand into the motor/pay-per-mile sector Root create a pay-per-mile model (unlikely imo due to their entire business being based on quoting your behaviour but you cant rule it out) Targeting infrequent drivers is a bit of a niche however this can also be viewed as a positive as they are set to dominate said niche For whatever reason, they do not expand to as many states as quickly as they desire, I will not pretend to understand what potential red tape is there The forecasted profits are from their investor deck so they are of course going to big themselves up, regardless I like what I see Wrap Up/TLDR ""Buffet had Geico.

Quick explanation: MetroMile are a digital pay-per-mile insurance company that are starting to massively disrupt the market with a strong focus on AI, machine learning and user experience. Longer description from MM themselves: Metromile is a leading pay-per-mile car insurance company in the U.S. Recognized by Forrester as a top insurance carrier in user experience, it is creating a loyal community of drivers with personalized insurance that is customized to each driver to be more affordable. Powered by machine learning and customer-centric design, Metromile is at the forefront of disrupting a more than $250 billion personal auto insurance industry that has gone unchanged for decades. Through Metromile Enterprise, our software-as-a-service business group, we license our proprietary artificial intelligence claims platform to automate claims, reduce losses associated with fraud, and unlock the productivity of insurance carriers’ employees so they can work on higher-impact experiences. We’re a diverse team that combines Silicon Valley’s best technologists with veterans from Fortune 500 insurers and financial service institutions. This approach ensures that we’re as equally focused on loss ratios, unit economics and profitability as on customer experience and technology innovation. Market disrupting InsureTech, driven by AI, machine learning and a strong focus on transparency and user experience - why does that sound familiar? That's right. When life gives you lemons, you make a disruptive AI based home/rental insurance company called LEMONADE that has blasted off to $163 a share.

Metromile has been voted a Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and the Phoenix Business Journal. Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and CTO of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. He has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics, remote sensing, and computer vision.Dan holds a master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision from Stanford University and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, where he received the Michtom Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science and graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors in Computer Science. CTO Paw Andersen: A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber's Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies. And then Founder & Chairman David Friedberg, the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki, the NY Post and Linkedin: Former Google employee. The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1B sale to Monsanto in 2013. The Climate Corporation (now known as Climate Field View) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields. From nitrogen levels in soil from historical weather, to satellite imagery mapping out crop health & vegetation maps, it uses data science to make farming better. This guys knows his shit and has a wealth of experience in big data. Expansion, Opportunity and Catalysts They are currently operational in just 8 of 50 U.S. states; Washington, California, Oregon, Illinois, Arizona, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. They plan to be live in 21 states in 2021 and 49 in 2022 Those current 8 states represent 45m potential drivers that can save with MetroMile, that number jumps to 143m drivers in 2022 (with 49 states) representing $160B in potential premiums (seriously, if you look at one thing in that investor deck I linked, jump to slide 30) The IPO transaction has provided an estimated $294 Million in cash to pursue growth opportunities They are looking to expand and cross sell into other verticals such as; Homeowners, Renters, Pet, Warranties & Maintenance through 2021-2022 They are licensing their leading AI claims platform and cannot be just viewed as an auto insurance provider (more on that below) They are integrating and partnering with car manufacturers to refer customers, 2 are already signed up and one of them is FORD, they expect 8 by 2022 so keep an eye out for announcements There are ambitions to go global In December they provided a Q3 earnings update and 2020 forecast exceeding expectations (Source), we should be due Q4/2020 final numbers soon NOT just an insurance provider - FinTech LICENSING Growth This one is important and needs attention - you know that leading, sophisticated, claims AI platform they've built? They are now LICENSING that through their MetroMile ENTERPRISE arm of the business, and its built to work on top of standard claims management software. This licensing delivered $5.6m additional revenue in 2020 and is forecast to increase significantly YoY ($12.4m in 2021 > $21.7m 2022 > $33.7m in 2023 > $48.3m in 2024) - you cannot just look at $MILE as an insurance disruptor, they are also a software/technology company It seems they are not allowed to name everyone who is using their Enterprise tech at this time but do list Tokio Marine, a ""Top 10 US Carrier"" and a ""US Carrier"". They say they have 4 deployed, 22 planned by 2022 and 46 in the pipeline. What about the competition? On a technology level, the closest form of competition I can see is Root, however their USP is that they quote you based on your driving behaviour. It utilises machine learning and an app that analyses your driving before pricing you up. MetroMile does the opposite, it does not charge you at all based on your behaviour, it is per mile. Lemonade could also be classed as a competitor but they focus on the home/rental vertical. On a business model level, Mile Wise (from All State) is the closest, they are also using a pay-per-mile model but lack the same depth of tech behind them compared to $MILE from what I can see. The world and our habits have changed, $MILE are poised to grab that by the horns A pandemic riddled world has seen hundreds of millions of people driving less and burning cash on insured vehicles sitting on their drive ways unused - myself included In the UK, at the height of the pandemic last year only 22% of cars were on the road (Source), that's a whopping 78% decrease and that is not even taking into account that the 22% on the road were likely driving less than usual (YES...I understand $MILE is a U.S. company, unfortunately I could not find any U.S. equivalent data but it's still a relevant stat no doubt replicated to varying degrees throughout the world) A survey shows after the pandemic 25% of drivers plan to drive less: Source (sorry, another UK source I know but I couldn't find similar for the U.S., this is a generalisation of the western world but again as above it will be replicated no doubt to varying degrees) OK...so as I was typing I found this which shows US mileage dropped by as much as 60% during the height of the pandemic last year: Source - the caveat is of course that mileage and car use will absolutely pick up as the pandemic ebbs and flows and eventually ends 22.7% of employed Americans were working from home in September due to the pandemic and in management/professional occupations that number rockets to over 40%: Source When the world emerges from this, office hours and behaviour will never be the same, working-from-home and hybrid ""x days at home and x days in the office"" will become the norm, the pandemic has forced companies and employees to prove they can work just fine from home - and that they have, in many cases exceeded expectations. Before the pandemic was a thing there was STILL a clear need for this in the market, this was always going to be an appealing and great model, COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to bring $MILE to the forefront quicker. Ready to expand. Do you really think all these people who have picked up recipe box subscriptions, online grocery shopping, at home spin/peloton classes and more will revert back to the old way pre-pandemic? Some may, but most will not. People like convenience and ease of use. New habits will stay. Cons/Watch Outs The move to hybrid or work-from-home models may not be adopted as much as we think post-pandemic - personally I don't think this will be an issue because 1) I just cannot see a world where businesses don't adapt to this, it ultimately saves them money and 2) this business model is not built on a pandemic, as I said COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to drive adoption and awareness. The insurance goliaths (i.e. Geico) develop or market their own pay-per-mile model (I am not based in the U.S. so any additional insight in the comments from you guys is welcome, let's make this a discussion) - I don't see this happening any time soon, at least, not to the same complexity that $MILE are achieving, it would require huge investment and development to build anything near what $MILE have but you can't rule Buffet/Geico out Someone like Lemonade expand into the motor/pay-per-mile sector Root create a pay-per-mile model (unlikely imo due to their entire business being based on quoting your behaviour but you cant rule it out) Targeting infrequent drivers is a bit of a niche however this can also be viewed as a positive as they are set to dominate said niche For whatever reason, they do not expand to as many states as quickly as they desire, I will not pretend to understand what potential red tape is there The forecasted profits are from their investor deck so they are of course going to big themselves up, regardless I like what I see Wrap Up/TLDR ""Buffet had Geico.

On a technology level, the closest form of competition I can see is Root, however their USP is that they quote you based on your driving behaviour.

Full disclosure, the below are all excerpts taken from MetroMile's website and not my words, but they looks impressive. CEO Dan Preston: Joined Metromile in 2013 as Chief Technology Officer before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Under his leadership, Metromile has experienced significant policy, premium and employee growth. The company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios. Metromile has been voted a Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and the Phoenix Business Journal. Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and CTO of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. He has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics, remote sensing, and computer vision.Dan holds a master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision from Stanford University and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, where he received the Michtom Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science and graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors in Computer Science. CTO Paw Andersen: A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber's Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies. And then Founder & Chairman David Friedberg, the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki, the NY Post and Linkedin: Former Google employee. The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1B sale to Monsanto in 2013. The Climate Corporation (now known as Climate Field View) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields.

On a technology level, the closest form of competition I can see is Root, however their USP is that they quote you based on your driving behaviour. It utilises machine learning and an app that analyses your driving before pricing you up. MetroMile does the opposite, it does not charge you at all based on your behaviour, it is per mile. Lemonade could also be classed as a competitor but they focus on the home/rental vertical. On a business model level, Mile Wise (from All State) is the closest, they are also using a pay-per-mile model but lack the same depth of tech behind them compared to $MILE from what I can see. The world and our habits have changed, $MILE are poised to grab that by the horns A pandemic riddled world has seen hundreds of millions of people driving less and burning cash on insured vehicles sitting on their drive ways unused - myself included In the UK, at the height of the pandemic last year only 22% of cars were on the road (Source), that's a whopping 78% decrease and that is not even taking into account that the 22% on the road were likely driving less than usual (YES...I understand $MILE is a U.S. company, unfortunately I could not find any U.S. equivalent data but it's still a relevant stat no doubt replicated to varying degrees throughout the world) A survey shows after the pandemic 25% of drivers plan to drive less: Source (sorry, another UK source I know but I couldn't find similar for the U.S., this is a generalisation of the western world but again as above it will be replicated no doubt to varying degrees) OK...so as I was typing I found this which shows US mileage dropped by as much as 60% during the height of the pandemic last year: Source - the caveat is of course that mileage and car use will absolutely pick up as the pandemic ebbs and flows and eventually ends 22.7% of employed Americans were working from home in September due to the pandemic and in management/professional occupations that number rockets to over 40%: Source When the world emerges from this, office hours and behaviour will never be the same, working-from-home and hybrid ""x days at home and x days in the office"" will become the norm, the pandemic has forced companies and employees to prove they can work just fine from home - and that they have, in many cases exceeded expectations. Before the pandemic was a thing there was STILL a clear need for this in the market, this was always going to be an appealing and great model, COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to bring $MILE to the forefront quicker. Ready to expand. Do you really think all these people who have picked up recipe box subscriptions, online grocery shopping, at home spin/peloton classes and more will revert back to the old way pre-pandemic? Some may, but most will not. People like convenience and ease of use. New habits will stay. Cons/Watch Outs The move to hybrid or work-from-home models may not be adopted as much as we think post-pandemic - personally I don't think this will be an issue because 1) I just cannot see a world where businesses don't adapt to this, it ultimately saves them money and 2) this business model is not built on a pandemic, as I said COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to drive adoption and awareness. The insurance goliaths (i.e. Geico) develop or market their own pay-per-mile model (I am not based in the U.S. so any additional insight in the comments from you guys is welcome, let's make this a discussion) - I don't see this happening any time soon, at least, not to the same complexity that $MILE are achieving, it would require huge investment and development to build anything near what $MILE have but you can't rule Buffet/Geico out Someone like Lemonade expand into the motor/pay-per-mile sector Root create a pay-per-mile model (unlikely imo due to their entire business being based on quoting your behaviour but you cant rule it out) Targeting infrequent drivers is a bit of a niche however this can also be viewed as a positive as they are set to dominate said niche For whatever reason, they do not expand to as many states as quickly as they desire, I will not pretend to understand what potential red tape is there The forecasted profits are from their investor deck so they are of course going to big themselves up, regardless I like what I see Wrap Up/TLDR ""Buffet had Geico.

Full disclosure, the below are all excerpts taken from MetroMile's website and not my words, but they looks impressive. CEO Dan Preston: Joined Metromile in 2013 as Chief Technology Officer before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Under his leadership, Metromile has experienced significant policy, premium and employee growth. The company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios. Metromile has been voted a Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and the Phoenix Business Journal. Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and CTO of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. He has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics, remote sensing, and computer vision.Dan holds a master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision from Stanford University and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, where he received the Michtom Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science and graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors in Computer Science. CTO Paw Andersen: A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber's Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies. And then Founder & Chairman David Friedberg, the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki, the NY Post and Linkedin: Former Google employee. The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1B sale to Monsanto in 2013. The Climate Corporation (now known as Climate Field View) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields. From nitrogen levels in soil from historical weather, to satellite imagery mapping out crop health & vegetation maps, it uses data science to make farming better.

Market disrupting InsureTech, driven by AI, machine learning and a strong focus on transparency and user experience - why does that sound familiar? That's right. When life gives you lemons, you make a disruptive AI based home/rental insurance company called LEMONADE that has blasted off to $163 a share.

Full disclosure, the below are all excerpts taken from MetroMile's website and not my words, but they looks impressive. CEO Dan Preston: Joined Metromile in 2013 as Chief Technology Officer before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Under his leadership, Metromile has experienced significant policy, premium and employee growth. The company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios. Metromile has been voted a Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and the Phoenix Business Journal. Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and CTO of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. He has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics, remote sensing, and computer vision.Dan holds a master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision from Stanford University and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, where he received the Michtom Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science and graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors in Computer Science. CTO Paw Andersen: A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber's Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies. And then Founder & Chairman David Friedberg, the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki, the NY Post and Linkedin: Former Google employee. The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1B sale to Monsanto in 2013. The Climate Corporation (now known as Climate Field View) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields. From nitrogen levels in soil from historical weather, to satellite imagery mapping out crop health & vegetation maps, it uses data science to make farming better. This guys knows his shit and has a wealth of experience in big data. Expansion, Opportunity and Catalysts They are currently operational in just 8 of 50 U.S. states; Washington, California, Oregon, Illinois, Arizona, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. They plan to be live in 21 states in 2021 and 49 in 2022 Those current 8 states represent 45m potential drivers that can save with MetroMile, that number jumps to 143m drivers in 2022 (with 49 states) representing $160B in potential premiums (seriously, if you look at one thing in that investor deck I linked, jump to slide 30) The IPO transaction has provided an estimated $294 Million in cash to pursue growth opportunities They are looking to expand and cross sell into other verticals such as; Homeowners, Renters, Pet, Warranties & Maintenance through 2021-2022 They are licensing their leading AI claims platform and cannot be just viewed as an auto insurance provider (more on that below) They are integrating and partnering with car manufacturers to refer customers, 2 are already signed up and one of them is FORD, they expect 8 by 2022 so keep an eye out for announcements There are ambitions to go global In December they provided a Q3 earnings update and 2020 forecast exceeding expectations (Source), we should be due Q4/2020 final numbers soon NOT just an insurance provider - FinTech LICENSING Growth This one is important and needs attention - you know that leading, sophisticated, claims AI platform they've built? They are now LICENSING that through their MetroMile ENTERPRISE arm of the business, and its built to work on top of standard claims management software. This licensing delivered $5.6m additional revenue in 2020 and is forecast to increase significantly YoY ($12.4m in 2021 > $21.7m 2022 > $33.7m in 2023 > $48.3m in 2024) - you cannot just look at $MILE as an insurance disruptor, they are also a software/technology company It seems they are not allowed to name everyone who is using their Enterprise tech at this time but do list Tokio Marine, a ""Top 10 US Carrier"" and a ""US Carrier"".

On a technology level, the closest form of competition I can see is Root, however their USP is that they quote you based on your driving behaviour.

Full disclosure, the below are all excerpts taken from MetroMile's website and not my words, but they looks impressive. CEO Dan Preston: Joined Metromile in 2013 as Chief Technology Officer before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Under his leadership, Metromile has experienced significant policy, premium and employee growth. The company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios. Metromile has been voted a Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and the Phoenix Business Journal. Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and CTO of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. He has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics, remote sensing, and computer vision.Dan holds a master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision from Stanford University and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, where he received the Michtom Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science and graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors in Computer Science. CTO Paw Andersen: A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber's Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies. And then Founder & Chairman David Friedberg, the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki, the NY Post and Linkedin: Former Google employee. The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1B sale to Monsanto in 2013. The Climate Corporation (now known as Climate Field View) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields. From nitrogen levels in soil from historical weather, to satellite imagery mapping out crop health & vegetation maps, it uses data science to make farming better.

If you really adhere to it you might save money but it's a pain and the cost of something more isn't significantly more which limits the upside of the company.A few trips on a low mileage lease and you've blown that up. A few heavy usage days on a limited phone plan and you've blown that up, too.I used to use Ting for cell phone but it wasn't worth it, only saved about $10-15 per month compared to the Verizon family unlimited plan for my one line.Stuff like this sounds good but IMO is difficult to implement and produce meaningful savings.",0,0.542,NEGATIVE,1.0

Full disclosure, the below are all excerpts taken from MetroMile's website and not my words, but they looks impressive. CEO Dan Preston: Joined Metromile in 2013 as Chief Technology Officer before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Under his leadership, Metromile has experienced significant policy, premium and employee growth. The company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios. Metromile has been voted a Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and the Phoenix Business Journal. Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and CTO of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. He has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics, remote sensing, and computer vision.Dan holds a master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision from Stanford University and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, where he received the Michtom Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science and graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors in Computer Science. CTO Paw Andersen: A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber's Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies. And then Founder & Chairman David Friedberg, the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki, the NY Post and Linkedin: Former Google employee. The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1B sale to Monsanto in 2013. The Climate Corporation (now known as Climate Field View) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields. From nitrogen levels in soil from historical weather, to satellite imagery mapping out crop health & vegetation maps, it uses data science to make farming better. This guys knows his shit and has a wealth of experience in big data.

They are now LICENSING that through their MetroMile ENTERPRISE arm of the business, and its built to work on top of standard claims management software. This licensing delivered $5.6m additional revenue in 2020 and is forecast to increase significantly YoY ($12.4m in 2021 > $21.7m 2022 > $33.7m in 2023 > $48.3m in 2024) - you cannot just look at $MILE as an insurance disruptor, they are also a software/technology company It seems they are not allowed to name everyone who is using their Enterprise tech at this time but do list Tokio Marine, a ""Top 10 US Carrier"" and a ""US Carrier"".

Do you really think all these people who have picked up recipe box subscriptions, online grocery shopping, at home spin/peloton classes and more will revert back to the old way pre-pandemic? Some may, but most will not. People like convenience and ease of use. New habits will stay. Cons/Watch Outs The move to hybrid or work-from-home models may not be adopted as much as we think post-pandemic - personally I don't think this will be an issue because 1) I just cannot see a world where businesses don't adapt to this, it ultimately saves them money and 2) this business model is not built on a pandemic, as I said COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to drive adoption and awareness. The insurance goliaths (i.e. Geico) develop or market their own pay-per-mile model (I am not based in the U.S. so any additional insight in the comments from you guys is welcome, let's make this a discussion) - I don't see this happening any time soon, at least, not to the same complexity that $MILE are achieving, it would require huge investment and development to build anything near what $MILE have but you can't rule Buffet/Geico out Someone like Lemonade expand into the motor/pay-per-mile sector Root create a pay-per-mile model (unlikely imo due to their entire business being based on quoting your behaviour but you cant rule it out) Targeting infrequent drivers is a bit of a niche however this can also be viewed as a positive as they are set to dominate said niche For whatever reason, they do not expand to as many states as quickly as they desire, I will not pretend to understand what potential red tape is there The forecasted profits are from their investor deck so they are of course going to big themselves up, regardless I like what I see Wrap Up/TLDR ""Buffet had Geico. I choose MetroMile"" - Chamath Palihapitiya. Go and read Chamath's one pager here: https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1331278297930428417 This is not a swing trade, this is not that P&D shit, this is a buy early, hold and ride the wave of a growing company built on great tech, a great team and a great business model. Here's your TLDR; read it properly and actually make a decision for yourself because I feel this is a sleeping giant just waiting to explode. $INAQ's share price jumped from around $9 pre SPAC announcement in December to around $17 today. However since completing the merger on Wed 10th Feb 2020 and the ticker renaming to $MILE the price has barely moved, dipping a dollar or so and maintaining pre merger completion levels. I feel like the market are really sleeping on this and they are flying under the radar so I am getting in now before they reach their potential. I like the stock, I have a lot of confidence in it.","""MetroMile does the opposite, it does not charge you at all based on your behaviour, it is per mile."" - if this is true it explains why this insurance company would fail, and it would mean that all this AI is worthless. What would be the point of AI if you did not observe driving habits? Your car already has an odometer. Now that a few months have passed, we can see that this is another Chamath charade. I am now willing to take a large loss to get out of anything that this toxic ""dictator"" is involved with. I'm cutting narcissists out of my life.",0,0.552,NEGATIVE,1.0
