,"The trucks have gone from brown to blue and smiley in my neighborhood - if Amazon makes bank on its AWS system that was originally developed for their own use, how long will it be before they similarly take their distribution into competition with the other guys (or buy them out)? Thoughts?","Nothing. Amazon is not exactly their bread and butter. Local deliveries have very little profit, can actually be a loss if second attempt.",0,0.525,NEGATIVE,1.0

Thoughts?","The whole reason Amazon ships with UPS, FedEx, DHL, and USPS is because their volume is too large for any one carrier to handle. I presume it would be too much for them to handle alone too. Also, Amazon’s transportation arm is mainly just moving inventory from one warehouse to the other, not delivering customer orders. The amount of infrastructure they would need to build out to take over customer delivery by themselves would be monumental.That’s also why they are pushing for people to choose one day a week to receive packages, in effect reducing the number of shipments needed.",0,0.525,NEGATIVE,0.999

Thoughts?","Amazon’s last mile capabilities are bigger than you think, in EU it delivers more than any other carrier in any EU5 country. Not sure about the US but I wouldn’t imagine anything different and in the next couple of years it will only keep reinvesting and scaling up their fleet.",1,0.523,POSITIVE,0.982
