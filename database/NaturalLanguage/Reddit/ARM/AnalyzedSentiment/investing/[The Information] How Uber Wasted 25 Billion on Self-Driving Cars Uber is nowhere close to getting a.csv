,"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/infighting-busywork-missed-warnings-how-uber-wasted-2-5-billion-on-self-driving-cars After five years and an investment of around $2.5 billion, Uber’s effort to build a self-driving car has produced this: a car that can’t drive more than half a mile without encountering a problem. “The car doesn’t drive well” and “struggles with simple routes and simple maneuvers,” said a manager in the unit, in a 1,500-word email sent three weeks ago to Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, warning of the issues. The self-driving–car unit “has simply failed to evolve and produce meaningful progress in so long that something has to be said before a disaster befalls us,” said the manager in the email, which The Information has seen. The manager—whose identity The Information confirmed—reflects a common belief across Uber that the unit, known as the Advanced Technologies Group, is destined to lose the high-stakes race to its rivals, which have demonstrated a lot more headway, comparatively speaking. The ride-hail giant’s Advance Technologies Group has been beset by infighting and setbacks, the Information reports, leading to fears that rivals like Alphabet-owned Waymo and Apple’s self-driving tech may soon leave it in the dust. Despite the team first beginning its research in 2015, Uber’s self-driving car “doesn’t drive well” and “struggles with simple routines and simple maneuvers,” a manager in the unit told CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, the report said. “The talent is still here to get this job done, but the belief is waning,” he said. The manager raised the alarm because the arm of the company “has simply failed to evolve and produce meaningful progress in so long that something has to be said before a disaster befalls us,” according to The Information. Teams within the group have competing philosophies, according to the report, with members who were recruited from aerospace or the government focused on safety above all, while engineers feel that progress is moving too slowly in the wake of a 2018 accident which saw a pedestrian killed by a self-driving Uber in Arizona. The engineers feel that Uber “overcorrected” following the accident, and “want to go back to the… fatality days,” one member of the team told the Information. Uber has been adamant about its public commitment to safety with its self-driving cars. SEE ALSO Self-driving Uber kills pedestrian “We aren’t just building software and throwing it on the road and seeing how it works. Everything we make has to have rigor around it in verification [of the software’s safety],” Eric Meyhofer, chief of the self-driving unit, told the Information. “That can cause frustrations, and I see that too.” Jon Thomason, who last week revealed he was leaving Uber after three years as the head of software engineering for the autonomous team in favor of a CTO position at AI company Brain Corp., said in his farewell letter that the team was increasingly “bogged down in many layers of things that are not real work, and most insidiously, activities that don’t even lead to real work.” Employees within the unit are reportedly skeptical of the ability of Khosrowshahi — the former CEO of Expedia — to hold the unit accountable. Former CTO Thuam Pham, who quit in April, told the publication that over the past two years he “periodically raised concerns” about how much progress was being made by the unit. “I just don’t understand why, from all observable measures, this thing isn’t making progress,” he said. “How come there hasn’t been accountability or transparency.” Khosrowshahi declined to comment on the report, but Meyhofer defended the executive, calling him “more than proficient” in his understanding of Uber’s self-driving goals, and adding that he “definitely has the chops to evaluate our milestones or our progress toward our milestones or to help in articulating what milestones to think about or how he’d like to see us describe our progress,” he said. Meyhofer said that the self-driving unit, which last year got a $1 billion investment from a Toyota-led fund, would likely raise funds from outside investors, as profitability is still years away. “Since we took the first investment money, that began the journey of us being thoughtful about how to go the distance,” he said. “We expect to have more partnerships.” Shares of Uber were up 3.7 percent Monday morning after a British judge granted it an 18-month taxi license to continue operating in London, one of its biggest markets.",This company built an iOS app...

,"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/infighting-busywork-missed-warnings-how-uber-wasted-2-5-billion-on-self-driving-cars After five years and an investment of around $2.5 billion, Uber’s effort to build a self-driving car has produced this: a car that can’t drive more than half a mile without encountering a problem. “The car doesn’t drive well” and “struggles with simple routes and simple maneuvers,” said a manager in the unit, in a 1,500-word email sent three weeks ago to Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, warning of the issues. The self-driving–car unit “has simply failed to evolve and produce meaningful progress in so long that something has to be said before a disaster befalls us,” said the manager in the email, which The Information has seen. The manager—whose identity The Information confirmed—reflects a common belief across Uber that the unit, known as the Advanced Technologies Group, is destined to lose the high-stakes race to its rivals, which have demonstrated a lot more headway, comparatively speaking. The ride-hail giant’s Advance Technologies Group has been beset by infighting and setbacks, the Information reports, leading to fears that rivals like Alphabet-owned Waymo and Apple’s self-driving tech may soon leave it in the dust. Despite the team first beginning its research in 2015, Uber’s self-driving car “doesn’t drive well” and “struggles with simple routines and simple maneuvers,” a manager in the unit told CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, the report said. “The talent is still here to get this job done, but the belief is waning,” he said. The manager raised the alarm because the arm of the company “has simply failed to evolve and produce meaningful progress in so long that something has to be said before a disaster befalls us,” according to The Information. Teams within the group have competing philosophies, according to the report, with members who were recruited from aerospace or the government focused on safety above all, while engineers feel that progress is moving too slowly in the wake of a 2018 accident which saw a pedestrian killed by a self-driving Uber in Arizona.

Sure Eric is still there as far as I know but Jon was really the one who brought a lot of the current team and direction together in my opinion even though I wasn't really at the company for very long it was obvious there was had been infighting between management directions and without a better vision we were doomed to fail then COVID happened so I believe it will take a miracle for them to stay afloat for much longer I think the company most likely will be sold off in some way but not sure how.,0,0.531,POSITIVE,0.594
,"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/infighting-busywork-missed-warnings-how-uber-wasted-2-5-billion-on-self-driving-cars After five years and an investment of around $2.5 billion, Uber’s effort to build a self-driving car has produced this: a car that can’t drive more than half a mile without encountering a problem. “The car doesn’t drive well” and “struggles with simple routes and simple maneuvers,” said a manager in the unit, in a 1,500-word email sent three weeks ago to Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, warning of the issues. The self-driving–car unit “has simply failed to evolve and produce meaningful progress in so long that something has to be said before a disaster befalls us,” said the manager in the email, which The Information has seen. The manager—whose identity The Information confirmed—reflects a common belief across Uber that the unit, known as the Advanced Technologies Group, is destined to lose the high-stakes race to its rivals, which have demonstrated a lot more headway, comparatively speaking. The ride-hail giant’s Advance Technologies Group has been beset by infighting and setbacks, the Information reports, leading to fears that rivals like Alphabet-owned Waymo and Apple’s self-driving tech may soon leave it in the dust. Despite the team first beginning its research in 2015, Uber’s self-driving car “doesn’t drive well” and “struggles with simple routines and simple maneuvers,” a manager in the unit told CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, the report said. “The talent is still here to get this job done, but the belief is waning,” he said. The manager raised the alarm because the arm of the company “has simply failed to evolve and produce meaningful progress in so long that something has to be said before a disaster befalls us,” according to The Information. Teams within the group have competing philosophies, according to the report, with members who were recruited from aerospace or the government focused on safety above all, while engineers feel that progress is moving too slowly in the wake of a 2018 accident which saw a pedestrian killed by a self-driving Uber in Arizona. The engineers feel that Uber “overcorrected” following the accident, and “want to go back to the… fatality days,” one member of the team told the Information. Uber has been adamant about its public commitment to safety with its self-driving cars. SEE ALSO Self-driving Uber kills pedestrian “We aren’t just building software and throwing it on the road and seeing how it works. Everything we make has to have rigor around it in verification [of the software’s safety],” Eric Meyhofer, chief of the self-driving unit, told the Information. “That can cause frustrations, and I see that too.” Jon Thomason, who last week revealed he was leaving Uber after three years as the head of software engineering for the autonomous team in favor of a CTO position at AI company Brain Corp., said in his farewell letter that the team was increasingly “bogged down in many layers of things that are not real work, and most insidiously, activities that don’t even lead to real work.” Employees within the unit are reportedly skeptical of the ability of Khosrowshahi — the former CEO of Expedia — to hold the unit accountable. Former CTO Thuam Pham, who quit in April, told the publication that over the past two years he “periodically raised concerns” about how much progress was being made by the unit. “I just don’t understand why, from all observable measures, this thing isn’t making progress,” he said. “How come there hasn’t been accountability or transparency.” Khosrowshahi declined to comment on the report, but Meyhofer defended the executive, calling him “more than proficient” in his understanding of Uber’s self-driving goals, and adding that he “definitely has the chops to evaluate our milestones or our progress toward our milestones or to help in articulating what milestones to think about or how he’d like to see us describe our progress,” he said. Meyhofer said that the self-driving unit, which last year got a $1 billion investment from a Toyota-led fund, would likely raise funds from outside investors, as profitability is still years away. “Since we took the first investment money, that began the journey of us being thoughtful about how to go the distance,” he said. “We expect to have more partnerships.” Shares of Uber were up 3.7 percent Monday morning after a British judge granted it an 18-month taxi license to continue operating in London, one of its biggest markets.","Out of curiosity, how common was the sentiment that Uber overcorrected after the accident? I can't believe I saw those words in this article.I was shocked and disappointed that Uber essentially had no liability in that case. To be clear, the safety driver was absolutely criminally liable IMO. But, the evidence I saw in reports brought about by the investigation showed that Uber was absolutely guilty of prioritizing just about everything over safety. Testing clearly problematic vehicles on public roads with safety features suppressed to prevent erratic behavior (coincidentally improving disengagement metrics no doubt) with the bare minimum number of safety driver(s) to reduce cost and no coherent unified safety team across the program.To me Uber's reaction was a clear indication that they know they deserved to be held partially liable and punished accordingly. To be clear I'm not saying that everyone there is bad, but the culture at the administrative level was/is unacceptable.",1,0.509,NEGATIVE,1.0

I felt like we as a company had committed a war crime and we were being constantly indoctrinated to never repeat the mistakes of the past. Sure it wasn't that long ago and correct me if im wrong cause im no expert on this topic but wasn't there some massive lawsuit that cost the company. The point is the answer is an absolute yes we were stunted by that event.It completely stunted speed imagine looking on the news Google goes NVO. While we are stuck not able to do the things they were able to get away with the cause of our own safety rules cutting us off.Now all that being said in the bigger picture I felt like I was in a much more ethical and morally correct company it was trying to get tasks finished as soon as possible but with the holistic safety framework in mind. We were doing literally everything by the book slow and steady wins the race was the motto (not really but might as well been).Overall in my opinion Tesla cars have had tremendous more deaths than Uber yet they haven't and still haven't faced similar or equal scrutiny than Uber did for that one incident. Like Uber took the moral high ground but it was in my opinion a mistake we should have ignored it just like Elon Musk does when someone dies in his Tesla that isn't even remotely road-ready or approved by Uber's standards sure Tesla has a disclaimer and that's how they get out of it I assume but so many people have died in the Tesla's autonomous driving mode.Sorry for the rant, I'm unemployed and pissed that I haven't started work yet lol.

It's disgusting that people have died (3 I think?) and yet Elon can come out and say things like ""LiDAR is a crutch"", and he doesn't immediately get told to go fuck himself and stop putting unready tech that was falsely advertised in the hands of consumers. It's insane.Second, I can understand the frustration. With large corporations, I repeatedly find that the administrators and the people making all the big decisions about operations are constantly cutting corners to save cost which puts the technology and the people performing operations in shitty positions, and then they are surprised when they underperform. Even at companies with ""good"" culture, this is a problem because they are still massive corporations with investors.To me that seems to be the case with Uber. All of my experiences would lead me to infer that the engineers genuinely care about safety, but the middle management or whoever is in charge of deciding where to spend money pulled the classic say one thing, do another management strategy. They say that safety is the priority and they will swoop in like hawks when a subordinate makes a mistake, but they won't spend the money it costs to do things right. They want the best of both worlds and they are willing to ignore the risk until shit happens.So yeah, I can empathize with the frustration of having the operational management running things like a back country carnival, but expecting engineering and operations to have aerospace grade safety validation.And yeah Levandowski brought over some source code from Waymo into Uber and that just recently settled for some crazy amount of money.Best of luck with work, everything is so weird right now.",3,0.517,NEGATIVE,1.0

Meyhofer said that the self-driving unit, which last year got a $1 billion investment from a Toyota-led fund, would likely raise funds from outside investors, as profitability is still years away. “Since we took the first investment money, that began the journey of us being thoughtful about how to go the distance,” he said. “We expect to have more partnerships.” Shares of Uber were up 3.7 percent Monday morning after a British judge granted it an 18-month taxi license to continue operating in London, one of its biggest markets.","Your inference is mistaken and perhaps I should have been clearer, I didn't expect anyone to pick up on that specific word. I didn't mean moral judgement of the driver (in a split instance, I don't think moral deliberation is necessarily helpful) I meant the judgement of 3rd parties in the event of incidents. It's likely that with different driving algorithms and decision making outcomes, autonomous cars might make decisions designed for the best outcome independently but end up colliding or causing some other issue in combination. That isn't necessarily a trivial problem to solve, and it may require an integrated system where the cars can communicate intent to one another. AFAIK, literally no manufacturer is looking into this, but I certainly would be,I also think you're wrong about the regulation part. I certainly agree that 'accidents' (let's be honest, they're rarely literally accidents are they, usually someone is being an idiot) should be reduced. But if there's one thing we love in our society, it's individual accountability (well unless you kill a cyclist) even if it's for the purpose of a lawsuit and if there's one thing companies hate, it's being sued. Regulations will have an impact on implementation timelines, and given the lack of consistency globally (or even in the US across states) this again will be sticky.Both of these things, even if we agreed they're trivial, are the least of it. What people forget about driving and drivers (when it comes to teaching machines how to do it) is how much of the skill of driving depends on the prior 17+ years of life experience every human being brings to the seat, and how difficult it is to compensate for that within algorithms that lack that context - and that's why I said this is a generalized AI problem, not a narrow or specific one. Again, no one (not even Tesla) are looking at generalized AI as part of the solution. They need to.BTW, I am taking only about 100% unsupervised autonomy in all situations, not about sunny-day drive-by-wire routes with 20mph limits and shiny new tarmac with fresh paint weekly. I'm talking about the car that can pick you up from JFK in a storm with idiots leaving their bags in the street, that's more pothole than road, and getting to midtown negotiating all the crazies along the way, roadworks and of course squirrels.",2,0.521,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/infighting-busywork-missed-warnings-how-uber-wasted-2-5-billion-on-self-driving-cars After five years and an investment of around $2.5 billion, Uber’s effort to build a self-driving car has produced this: a car that can’t drive more than half a mile without encountering a problem. “The car doesn’t drive well” and “struggles with simple routes and simple maneuvers,” said a manager in the unit, in a 1,500-word email sent three weeks ago to Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, warning of the issues. The self-driving–car unit “has simply failed to evolve and produce meaningful progress in so long that something has to be said before a disaster befalls us,” said the manager in the email, which The Information has seen. The manager—whose identity The Information confirmed—reflects a common belief across Uber that the unit, known as the Advanced Technologies Group, is destined to lose the high-stakes race to its rivals, which have demonstrated a lot more headway, comparatively speaking. The ride-hail giant’s Advance Technologies Group has been beset by infighting and setbacks, the Information reports, leading to fears that rivals like Alphabet-owned Waymo and Apple’s self-driving tech may soon leave it in the dust. Despite the team first beginning its research in 2015, Uber’s self-driving car “doesn’t drive well” and “struggles with simple routines and simple maneuvers,” a manager in the unit told CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, the report said. “The talent is still here to get this job done, but the belief is waning,” he said. The manager raised the alarm because the arm of the company “has simply failed to evolve and produce meaningful progress in so long that something has to be said before a disaster befalls us,” according to The Information. Teams within the group have competing philosophies, according to the report, with members who were recruited from aerospace or the government focused on safety above all, while engineers feel that progress is moving too slowly in the wake of a 2018 accident which saw a pedestrian killed by a self-driving Uber in Arizona.

We get it, you are optimistic about and invested in Tesla.However, you clearly don't understand the underlying autonomous technology. No machine ""thinks"", or makes moral decisions. That's not how it works. It's more helpful to think of it like plinko. It needs to take all those possible situations as an input and sort it out through a bunch of layers into the correct output in real time for an acceptable percentage of all given situations. What is acceptable is still up for debate, but obviously it needs to at least be better than humans if we are giving up our agency.Now obviously the car isn't a being that thinks and is capable of having morals, but it does need to be able to deliver ""desirable"" outcomes, which will absolutely be subject to the moral and ethical decisions of government. That is what the comment you were responding to is about.You are clearly invested in autonomous vehicles, which is great, but you should make no assumptions on the technology, or what the government will decide (which might even be less predictable than the technology) especially when you don't understand it at the technical level.I'm not even going to touch on the fact that you ""don't make moral decisions"" while driving lol, but it does remind me of someone recently who said they can't remember the last time they communicated with another driver on the road.

The manager—whose identity The Information confirmed—reflects a common belief across Uber that the unit, known as the Advanced Technologies Group, is destined to lose the high-stakes race to its rivals, which have demonstrated a lot more headway, comparatively speaking. The ride-hail giant’s Advance Technologies Group has been beset by infighting and setbacks, the Information reports, leading to fears that rivals like Alphabet-owned Waymo and Apple’s self-driving tech may soon leave it in the dust. Despite the team first beginning its research in 2015, Uber’s self-driving car “doesn’t drive well” and “struggles with simple routines and simple maneuvers,” a manager in the unit told CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, the report said. “The talent is still here to get this job done, but the belief is waning,” he said. The manager raised the alarm because the arm of the company “has simply failed to evolve and produce meaningful progress in so long that something has to be said before a disaster befalls us,” according to The Information. Teams within the group have competing philosophies, according to the report, with members who were recruited from aerospace or the government focused on safety above all, while engineers feel that progress is moving too slowly in the wake of a 2018 accident which saw a pedestrian killed by a self-driving Uber in Arizona. The engineers feel that Uber “overcorrected” following the accident, and “want to go back to the… fatality days,” one member of the team told the Information. Uber has been adamant about its public commitment to safety with its self-driving cars. SEE ALSO Self-driving Uber kills pedestrian “We aren’t just building software and throwing it on the road and seeing how it works. Everything we make has to have rigor around it in verification [of the software’s safety],” Eric Meyhofer, chief of the self-driving unit, told the Information. “That can cause frustrations, and I see that too.” Jon Thomason, who last week revealed he was leaving Uber after three years as the head of software engineering for the autonomous team in favor of a CTO position at AI company Brain Corp., said in his farewell letter that the team was increasingly “bogged down in many layers of things that are not real work, and most insidiously, activities that don’t even lead to real work.” Employees within the unit are reportedly skeptical of the ability of Khosrowshahi — the former CEO of Expedia — to hold the unit accountable. Former CTO Thuam Pham, who quit in April, told the publication that over the past two years he “periodically raised concerns” about how much progress was being made by the unit. “I just don’t understand why, from all observable measures, this thing isn’t making progress,” he said. “How come there hasn’t been accountability or transparency.” Khosrowshahi declined to comment on the report, but Meyhofer defended the executive, calling him “more than proficient” in his understanding of Uber’s self-driving goals, and adding that he “definitely has the chops to evaluate our milestones or our progress toward our milestones or to help in articulating what milestones to think about or how he’d like to see us describe our progress,” he said. Meyhofer said that the self-driving unit, which last year got a $1 billion investment from a Toyota-led fund, would likely raise funds from outside investors, as profitability is still years away. “Since we took the first investment money, that began the journey of us being thoughtful about how to go the distance,” he said. “We expect to have more partnerships.” Shares of Uber were up 3.7 percent Monday morning after a British judge granted it an 18-month taxi license to continue operating in London, one of its biggest markets.","I don't know why anyone would ever have thought Uber was close to a fully self driving car considering:They were taking the exact same approach to solving it as Google.They were starting many years after Google started.Google has a lot more resources then they could ever hope to throw at this project.And if that weren't enough:4) Google sued them for literally stealing their source code, and won. A judge ordered them to remove all of Google's source code from their self driving cars. Then a third party auditor came by later and determined that they still had significant proportions of Google's source code in their car, so obviously they were ordered to remove it.",0,0.513,NEGATIVE,1.0

You can literally make a self-driving car with just audio and video feeds.You can in fact make an algorithm that does everything by watching enough video. You just need enough content of perfectly correct driving and a big enough model.Of course the first self-driving vehicle will be a ton more complicated. But after a few updates it will converge to what I'm saying.A lot of systems are really hard to get using just ML, so hand-rolled is better and more efficient. But eventually ML catches up.For example, Stockfish was the best chess engine, but eventually Leela Chess Zero (deep learning bot) equalized. While SF makes small adjustments by hand to gain 10 ELO points the Lc0 engine generates millions of games to progress by 50 ELO. While they might still be comparable, in the future Lc0 will be insanely better. We run into problems of human cleverness. At a certain point you can't optimize out of a local minimum.You have dozens of conflicting heuristics, also possible new heuristics based on lost games. It's just so hard to squeeze out ELO by shuffling stuff around, replaying tests, adding more stuff, optimizing again.Lc0 just gets stronger because people contribute power to it. You need to maybe switch to a bigger network once it stops progressing, but it just keeps getting stronger with little human input.",5,0.518,NEGATIVE,0.995

Meyhofer said that the self-driving unit, which last year got a $1 billion investment from a Toyota-led fund, would likely raise funds from outside investors, as profitability is still years away. “Since we took the first investment money, that began the journey of us being thoughtful about how to go the distance,” he said. “We expect to have more partnerships.” Shares of Uber were up 3.7 percent Monday morning after a British judge granted it an 18-month taxi license to continue operating in London, one of its biggest markets.",,8,,,

Don't get me wrong, Tesla is definitely ahead of comma in self driving. There are also some caveats, like the fact that comma currently only works on Hondas and Toyotas. However, just like Tesla, comma and the open source projects behind it are only getting better, and it's much less expensive.Tesla could try a subscription model, but if the tech isn't ready who will pay? Tesla has chosen the branding of ""full self driving"" and that's what people expect when they spend that money. They can't just keep raising the upfront price for FSD. Tesla's big advantage in that situation is that you may want the Tesla just on its merits as a quality EV. Comma and projects like it will target Teslas last, if ever, so Tesla probably has a lock on Tesla owners, but those make up a fraction of the vehicles on the road. Ultimately when you make that decision to buy a new car in the near future you will at least have the option of getting a car with built in ADAS (because it's not actually FSD) from a variety of manufacturers. Whether you buy new or used, that comma unit will be available for supported vehicles for a fraction of the cost, and I don't see how you can beat that value direct to consumer.Also, comma hasn't killed people like Tesla.",6,0.527,NEGATIVE,0.999

,"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/infighting-busywork-missed-warnings-how-uber-wasted-2-5-billion-on-self-driving-cars After five years and an investment of around $2.5 billion, Uber’s effort to build a self-driving car has produced this: a car that can’t drive more than half a mile without encountering a problem. “The car doesn’t drive well” and “struggles with simple routes and simple maneuvers,” said a manager in the unit, in a 1,500-word email sent three weeks ago to Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, warning of the issues. The self-driving–car unit “has simply failed to evolve and produce meaningful progress in so long that something has to be said before a disaster befalls us,” said the manager in the email, which The Information has seen. The manager—whose identity The Information confirmed—reflects a common belief across Uber that the unit, known as the Advanced Technologies Group, is destined to lose the high-stakes race to its rivals, which have demonstrated a lot more headway, comparatively speaking. The ride-hail giant’s Advance Technologies Group has been beset by infighting and setbacks, the Information reports, leading to fears that rivals like Alphabet-owned Waymo and Apple’s self-driving tech may soon leave it in the dust. Despite the team first beginning its research in 2015, Uber’s self-driving car “doesn’t drive well” and “struggles with simple routines and simple maneuvers,” a manager in the unit told CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, the report said. “The talent is still here to get this job done, but the belief is waning,” he said. The manager raised the alarm because the arm of the company “has simply failed to evolve and produce meaningful progress in so long that something has to be said before a disaster befalls us,” according to The Information. Teams within the group have competing philosophies, according to the report, with members who were recruited from aerospace or the government focused on safety above all, while engineers feel that progress is moving too slowly in the wake of a 2018 accident which saw a pedestrian killed by a self-driving Uber in Arizona. The engineers feel that Uber “overcorrected” following the accident, and “want to go back to the… fatality days,” one member of the team told the Information.

,"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/infighting-busywork-missed-warnings-how-uber-wasted-2-5-billion-on-self-driving-cars After five years and an investment of around $2.5 billion, Uber’s effort to build a self-driving car has produced this: a car that can’t drive more than half a mile without encountering a problem. “The car doesn’t drive well” and “struggles with simple routes and simple maneuvers,” said a manager in the unit, in a 1,500-word email sent three weeks ago to Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, warning of the issues. The self-driving–car unit “has simply failed to evolve and produce meaningful progress in so long that something has to be said before a disaster befalls us,” said the manager in the email, which The Information has seen. The manager—whose identity The Information confirmed—reflects a common belief across Uber that the unit, known as the Advanced Technologies Group, is destined to lose the high-stakes race to its rivals, which have demonstrated a lot more headway, comparatively speaking. The ride-hail giant’s Advance Technologies Group has been beset by infighting and setbacks, the Information reports, leading to fears that rivals like Alphabet-owned Waymo and Apple’s self-driving tech may soon leave it in the dust. Despite the team first beginning its research in 2015, Uber’s self-driving car “doesn’t drive well” and “struggles with simple routines and simple maneuvers,” a manager in the unit told CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, the report said. “The talent is still here to get this job done, but the belief is waning,” he said. The manager raised the alarm because the arm of the company “has simply failed to evolve and produce meaningful progress in so long that something has to be said before a disaster befalls us,” according to The Information. Teams within the group have competing philosophies, according to the report, with members who were recruited from aerospace or the government focused on safety above all, while engineers feel that progress is moving too slowly in the wake of a 2018 accident which saw a pedestrian killed by a self-driving Uber in Arizona. The engineers feel that Uber “overcorrected” following the accident, and “want to go back to the… fatality days,” one member of the team told the Information. Uber has been adamant about its public commitment to safety with its self-driving cars.

Everything we make has to have rigor around it in verification [of the software’s safety],” Eric Meyhofer, chief of the self-driving unit, told the Information. “That can cause frustrations, and I see that too.” Jon Thomason, who last week revealed he was leaving Uber after three years as the head of software engineering for the autonomous team in favor of a CTO position at AI company Brain Corp., said in his farewell letter that the team was increasingly “bogged down in many layers of things that are not real work, and most insidiously, activities that don’t even lead to real work.” Employees within the unit are reportedly skeptical of the ability of Khosrowshahi — the former CEO of Expedia — to hold the unit accountable. Former CTO Thuam Pham, who quit in April, told the publication that over the past two years he “periodically raised concerns” about how much progress was being made by the unit. “I just don’t understand why, from all observable measures, this thing isn’t making progress,” he said. “How come there hasn’t been accountability or transparency.” Khosrowshahi declined to comment on the report, but Meyhofer defended the executive, calling him “more than proficient” in his understanding of Uber’s self-driving goals, and adding that he “definitely has the chops to evaluate our milestones or our progress toward our milestones or to help in articulating what milestones to think about or how he’d like to see us describe our progress,” he said. Meyhofer said that the self-driving unit, which last year got a $1 billion investment from a Toyota-led fund, would likely raise funds from outside investors, as profitability is still years away. “Since we took the first investment money, that began the journey of us being thoughtful about how to go the distance,” he said. “We expect to have more partnerships.” Shares of Uber were up 3.7 percent Monday morning after a British judge granted it an 18-month taxi license to continue operating in London, one of its biggest markets.",It’s not for lack of trying.
