,"In the post-PC world, has Intel an eye on the future? Key Stats for Intel Corporation Ticker INTC Sector Other Semiconductors Latest price $36.34 Value $171,125M Daily vol $566M Date 06 June 2017 Links Yahoo Finance, SEC Edgar, www.intel.com 1. What do thay do? Semiconductor chips. mainly! If you are under 30 you may have missed the Intel Inside logos that came with every PC in the 80s and 90s. There was an axis called Wintel where Microsoft and Intel dominated, Microsoft Windows was the software, Intel the semi-conductors, and some ""dumb"" manufacturer put it all together into a box... then the smartphone hit. Has it hurt them? Hardly from a cashflow perspective, though it has killed off growth. Metric 2016A 2015A 2014A 2013A 2012A Revenue $59bn $55bn $56bn $53bn $53bn EPS $2.12 $2.33 $2.31 $1.89 $2.13 When they describe their business, there are six exciting division names: Client Computing Group, Data Center Group, Internet of Things Group, Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group, the Security Group, Programmable Solutions Group, and the New Technology Group. But the business is still driven by the old chips for PCs, etc business (55% of sales) and the data center / communications unit (29% of sales) with none of the other 4 divisions clocking more than 5% of sales. But having missed the smartphone race, which was won by ARM, Intel is now betting big on autonomous cars. In April they agreed to spend $15bn to buy Mobileye, a ""global leader in the development of computer vision and machine learning, data analysis, localization and mapping for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving."" Will it work? Hard to tell. And Google, Tesla, Uber and a rake more folks are also playing in this space. But let's look at the forecasts 2 years out, we can see they are starting to pick up! Metric 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $59bn $60bn $62bn EPS $2.12 $2.86 $2.97 And if you are worried about INTC spending $15bn on Mobileye, note they currently have only $8bn of net debt, i.e. 0.4x it's latest operating profit. Plus they are selling their Security unit for $4bn. So it's balance sheet isn't stressed post deal. Therefore I can't see any reason to doubt their ability to keep paying nice divies and keep on buying back stock. 2. How do they compare? Compared to the old enemy AMD they continue to dominate, in sales, margins and returns... but that's missing the point, as the semiconductor world has moved on. Versus the rest of the sector their margins look reasonable, but clearly they aren't best in class.

They are the R&D king, yet outside of x86 and modems their history reads almost like a comedy of errors. Consider: Itanium, Larrabee, Intel Atom in smartphones, and wearables. They keep handing new emerging technologies and markets over to their competitors. It's frankly appalling when you consider that Intel could be a trillion dollar company if they hadn't screwed up so badly. For example, all that growth that Nvidia is experiencing? It easily could have been Intel's if they hadn't screwed up so badly with Larrabee (now Xeon Phi). So Intel taking over autonomous cars? It would be the first time they've succeeded with a new market in a really long time. I do not see it happening.",0,0.552,NEGATIVE,1.0

Intel plays the ""me too!"" game for a couple of years and then decides they're too far behind and it's time to cut their losses (like they did with phones).Didn't their CEO say something like ""self driving cars are gonna be big"" a couple weeks back? And all those players that have been developing self-driving tech for years were like ""so I guess you've been sleeping the last 5 years"".Intel should probably just stick to their core competancy: CPUs and platforms.

The nature of the partnerships is not the same as Mobileye's, as Nvidia, though they have their own, does not always provide the software that runs on their hardware (such as with Tesla who has their own). This is both a weakness and a strength, Tesla says they have tried to make their software platform-neutral so it could run on other hardware. That's bad for Nvidia if they move away from them. On the flip side this very thing, controlling or partially controlling their software, may may have made them/other companies less nervous partnering with them, not wanting to end up being Google's pawn.Relationships are Google's, though usually considered to have the best or near-best Tech, huge weakness.",2,0.524,NEGATIVE,0.999

What do thay do? Semiconductor chips. mainly! If you are under 30 you may have missed the Intel Inside logos that came with every PC in the 80s and 90s. There was an axis called Wintel where Microsoft and Intel dominated, Microsoft Windows was the software, Intel the semi-conductors, and some ""dumb"" manufacturer put it all together into a box... then the smartphone hit. Has it hurt them? Hardly from a cashflow perspective, though it has killed off growth.

But the business is still driven by the old chips for PCs, etc business (55% of sales) and the data center / communications unit (29% of sales) with none of the other 4 divisions clocking more than 5% of sales. But having missed the smartphone race, which was won by ARM, Intel is now betting big on autonomous cars. In April they agreed to spend $15bn to buy Mobileye, a ""global leader in the development of computer vision and machine learning, data analysis, localization and mapping for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving."" Will it work? Hard to tell. And Google, Tesla, Uber and a rake more folks are also playing in this space. But let's look at the forecasts 2 years out, we can see they are starting to pick up! Metric 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $59bn $60bn $62bn EPS $2.12 $2.86 $2.97 And if you are worried about INTC spending $15bn on Mobileye, note they currently have only $8bn of net debt, i.e. 0.4x it's latest operating profit. Plus they are selling their Security unit for $4bn. So it's balance sheet isn't stressed post deal. Therefore I can't see any reason to doubt their ability to keep paying nice divies and keep on buying back stock. 2. How do they compare? Compared to the old enemy AMD they continue to dominate, in sales, margins and returns... but that's missing the point, as the semiconductor world has moved on. Versus the rest of the sector their margins look reasonable, but clearly they aren't best in class.

So it's surprising that Wall Street isn't more excited, surely? Note: the stock's traded between 11 and 16 times forecast earnings over the last year, so it's not feeling toppy at the moment. And management haven't missed earnings in over 3 years. 4. Inside Intel? How often is a cash cow, like Intel trading on 13x times? A cashcow where management has one eye on the next big thing, autonomous cars, and the other eye of increasing shareholder returns. To me it seems like Wall Street isn't cutting them any slack. And unloved quality stocks are ones that tempt me! Sure, it may take 2 years for the success / failure to crystalize... but if I wait, surely I'll miss it?
