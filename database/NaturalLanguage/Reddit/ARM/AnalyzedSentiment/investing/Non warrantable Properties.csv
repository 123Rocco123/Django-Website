,"Why should it matter that a large percentage of condos in a community are investor owned? If their mortgage payments are on time, then why would a lender care? If the borrower has stellar credit and shows they can actually pay for the unit in cash, then why does the lender not focus on the borrower's financial ability and credit worthiness instead of something like: Allow single person or business to own more than two units in a development (for developments with 20 units or less) or 20% of all the units in a project (for developments with 21 units or more). Why do lenders not offer fixed rate interest rates for non-warrantable properties? It seems an ARM would increase the lender's risk. Does anyone know the specifics as to why Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae came up with their list of restrictions regarding non warrantable properties? i.e.: what do they see as risks?","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

However, if that person experiences a hardship, they are more likely to default on the investment property as they themselves are not living in it.And as another commenter posted, investment properties are not the primary mission in Fannie and Freddie’s charters. The primary goal is to liquidate the housing market to give as many as possible a path to home ownership",0,0.513,NEGATIVE,0.986

This would have been my first rental. Now, if I was applying for a 2nd, 3rd, etc. rental, then I understand I would become ""riskier.""",1,0.51,NEGATIVE,0.989

Are you saying that you are trying to buy 90 units? Youd have to look at that as 90 investments not just 1. Filing 90 units is more difficult than filling 1.From the lender perspective, they see that concentration in one complex as a risk as well. If something happens that impacts that particular complex (natural disaster, overall neighborhood value decline, etc.) then they are overexposed to that property.",2,0.516,NEGATIVE,1.0

So I imagine it’s kind of the same reasoning.If a single person has that big of an investment and they experience a hardship and defaulted on their units, it could be a detriment to the other units in the complex.

But here is my limited point of view...If I have an investment rental property (with small margins) and rates increase, then my monthly payment will increase. If that monthly payment increases, then it could cause me to break even or be in the red at the end of each month.In this case, the owner/investor may try to raise the rent to maintain monthly FCF. If the renter is already maxed out, then the renter will walk away. If rental income is already maxed out for the area, then there are 2 options left for the investor/owner.The investor sells the property (could be for a loss especially if the property was recently purchased).The investor just stops paying and goes into default. Since this is an investment, just take the loss and move on.A rate that raises could set off a chain of events that leads to both the renter and owner/investor walking away.I am sure the lender would rather have a note that is being paid on time, every time. Why would they risk losing that payable note with an ARM where rates are looking to increase over the near term?",1,0.526,NEGATIVE,1.0
