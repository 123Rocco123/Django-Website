,"So I'm poking around my Roth IRA. For years and years, I had my contributions go into Hartford Checks and Balances Fund Class because when I started the IRA, I had no clue (still mostly don't) and that's what the financial advisor at the bank suggested. I rolled with it for a number of years. Last year I started reading this subreddit and other sources, learned about Vanguard's funds, socked 10k into VSTAX, watched it climb. So a few months later, I put my 2017 and my late 2016 IRA contributions into VSTAX. It's been cooking nicely. Today I'm poking around at this IRA's holdings and I see HCKAX is, by far, the largest holding, and is down by a whole mess. But then digging around and looking at things over time, I'm seeing a ""CAP"" entry in the transactions for the account - similar to ""dividend"" and also reinvested, but it's huge - and at the same times each year, the share price plummets, and then slooowwwlly climbs back up. So what is this ""cap"" (I've googled but found stuff on market caps and ARMs, doesn't seem to be what I'm after)? Why does it tank the share price every year like clockwork? Is it basically a super-dividend that works like other dividends? Before I puzzled out the yearly thing, I was pondering selling off my holdings in HCKAX and moving them into VSTAX or a combo of VSTAX and one or two other Vanguard offerings. But, seeing as I'm right after the latest cap-and-plunge, the share price is as low as it's gonna get for months, if patterns hold true, so I'm thinking now is the worst time to sell it. Then again, HCKAX's share price hasn't been all that in recent years, and moving the assets into VSTAX as an example would get me, I expect, a far better return, even if I sold now. I would appreciate comments and advice. Thank you in advance!",Got it. Thanks for the reply!,0,0.507,POSITIVE,0.969

The fund paid both short-term and long-term cap gains distributions on Dec 15th. Cap gains are usually paid only once a year.That's not exactly an inexpensive fund to hold, with the 5.5% load and 1% expense ratio, so that's a strike against it.You can think of that cap gain distribution as a down payment on your sale <g>. The cap gains are embedded in the price as the fund earns them until they distribute them. Let's say you have 1000 shares of a fund on the day before a cap gain distribution of $1 per share, and the fund is priced at $11 per share. If you sell before the distribution, you get 1000 x $11 = $11,000. If you wait for the payout, you receive $1 per share or $1,000 and the fund price drops by that $1 (the cap gain isn't embedded anymore) so the fund is now at $10. The fund then takes the $1000 and buys 100 shares at $10, giving you 1100 shares in all. If you sell those shares you've got -- wait for it -- $11,000.",0,0.531,NEGATIVE,1.0

Oh, silly me.So it's basically a super-dividend in a sense, and it makes little sense for me to hang onto this fund if it's not performing all that hot, regardless of when the capital gain was paid out and (in my case) reinvested. I figured that's basically what was going on but wasn't sure of the source.I'm just curious why this happens - with this fund, at least - once a year vs. quarterly like the other dividends this fund pays out.And I get now why it wouldn't matter if I sold this fund off now, or a day before the cap payout, or six months from now.
