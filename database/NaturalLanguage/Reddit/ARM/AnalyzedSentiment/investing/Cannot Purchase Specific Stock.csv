,"Dear all, I want to buy a small amount of 'ARM PLC' stock. They are listed on the U.S. stock exchange & I am a Brit. I am using an ISA in the UK , and trying to purchase their stocks. However, I get the message: 'this instrument cannot be held in an I.S.A.' & I'm a bit stumped. Does anyone know why ? Thanks, -V","Looks like it’s a technicality in the ISA rules.“It is a scenario that we see quite frequently, where shares are issued on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) via an American Depository Share mechanism (ADS),"" an industry source told Yahoo Finance.”The strict reading of the ISA regulations means that the ADS doesn’t qualify to be held in a stocks & shares ISA, because the underlying shares themselves are not individually listed. It’s one of those scenarios where, logically, we can’t really see an obvious reason as to why the ADS shouldn’t be ISA qualifying, but that is how the ISA regulations are currently worded, which we have corroborated with HMRC several years ago.”https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-you-cant-buy-arm-stocks-shares-isa-accounts-064722591.html",0,0.526,NEGATIVE,0.999
