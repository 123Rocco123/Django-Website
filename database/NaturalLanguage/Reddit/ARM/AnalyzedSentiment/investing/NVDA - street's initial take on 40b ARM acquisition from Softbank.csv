,"This confirms months of speculation...here are the initial thoughts from analysts. Needham - ""Will It Be Game Changing? We Shall See."" ""We believe the acquisition represents a big risk but with potential huge awards. From a financial perspective, this acquisition is the largest deal in NVIDIA's history. We are not concerned about the size of the deal because NVIDIA generated $4.3BN of free cash flow in FY20 and is on track to generate $5.2BN in FY21, and hence we expect it to make up the $12BN in cash fairly quickly, even without a contribution from Arm. Additionally, the dilution represents only 7% of total shares - not a major event, in our view."" ""Strategically, we believe there are several advantages: in the near-term, Arm IP is ubiquitous in the mobile phone and tablet markets with 95% share. NVDA can harvest that steady cash flow stream to finance growth. ARM has a cumulative number of licenses signed of 1,767 as of F4Q19 and 22.8 billion royalty units as reported by licensee. Longer-term, Arm is gaining inroads in the all the major secular growth drivers in technology including cloud and infrastructure equipment, edge IoT, robotics and self-driving vehicles. Arm technology is being used in advanced MCUs for IoT devices such as communication chips and sensors and broad range of networking equipment."" ""On the skeptical side of the equation, we wonder about the anti-trust factors as Arm is the ""Arms-dealer"" in the semiconductor industry with a long list of customers, which include competitors, such as TI, MRVL, AMD, IFX, QCOM, AAPL, Samsung, NXPI, AVGO and others. We also need to have a better understanding of the long-term revenue ramp and overall TAM.

""We estimate the deal to be slightly accretive the first year after close."" ""Transformative Deal - Heterogeneous Data Center Scale Solution Provider: In previous computing eras, one ecosystem typically controlled 80% of the profits of the ecosystem – in PCs it was Wintel, in Smartphones it is Apple.

However, with ARM, we think Nvidia is poised to also offer general purpose, heterogeneous data center scale solutions and ultimately capture up to 80% of the value of the serial processing part of the data center ecosystem as well. We also think that ARM gives it a larger moat in the data center."" ""Transformative Deal - Unifying the Edge with the Data Center: the Cell Phone / Server Computing Era was the first where compute bifurcated, and two separate ecosystems operated in parallel (Apple’s ecosystem in the Smartphone, and Wintel in the data center). Should Nvidia successfully acquire ARM, then the compute ecosystem will be unified from edge to data center, and we would expect Nvidia to offer more highly integrated compute solutions across the entire compute ecosystem, and realize the lion’s share of the profits in this 4th Tectonic Shift in Computing."" ""Five-year EPS Power of $50. We believe this is a differentiated interpretation of NVidia's earnings potential which stems from our view that Nvidia is supplying an ecosystem in the data center, much like Apple supplies to the smart phone market, or Intel and Microsoft did in PCs. In contrast to other traditional semiconductor competitors, Nvidia's ecosystem extends beyond processors, to high speed interconnect (MLNX) and a software stack. During the PC Era, Microsoft's PC operating profit was similar to Intel's, and we think Nvidia's earnings potential framework should be modeled more like Wintel, with half of its earnings power coming from the ecosystem that it created. We model Nvidia Data Center processor revenues of $34bn in 2025, and Data Center Ecosystem (software) of an additional $34bn."" RBC - ""We continue to believe the same three major points: 1) biggest hurdle in our view is approval/official closing of transaction; 2) if the transaction closes, we think this would be a notable negative for Intel and a notable positive for Nvidia; and 3) with Apple, Amazon, and now Nvidia, a robust software ecosystem is ready to support an ARM-based server environment over the long term."" "" What do Apple and Nvidia have in common? Access to successful software ecosystems. Since x86 has been the dominant player in the server market, Nvidia could argue that the transaction would create more competition against the x86 market. Currently, the market is largely Intel ~85–90% (x86) and AMD 8–10% (x86) and a few points “Other” depending on how one defines the total market. If Nvidia puts research and development dollars behind the transaction, an ecosystem to compete against x86 would be possible, in our view, given Nvidia’s success with CUDA. Finally, AWS has a new Graviton product based on ARM architecture. It is arguably a stable/solid alternative given its lower power consumption. We’ve seen this story twice in the past in the Flops/Watt (GPU>CPU) and TCO (AMD>INTC"" Raymond James - "" As we had suspected earlier, much of the justification for the deal in the presentation centers on the datacenter market. Based on our initial read of the presentation, we view this as an assault on Intel’s server CPU business. The intention would seem to be to become able to offer server customers a broader roadmap that covers both CPU, GPU and server. It’s yet unclear however about how a NVDA datacenter business that would offer server CPUs benefit from NVDA owning ARM as opposed to simply being a licensee. Nonetheless, we do view this as a move on NVDA’s part to compete more fully with both INTC and AMD in the server pace. MRVL is also an ARM licensee for server CPUs, but since MRVL has already announced that they would only pursue custom server CPU engagements going forward, we don’t expect much impact to MRVL. Undoubtedly, the combination of ARM’s leading processor IP with NVDA’s GPU and AI IP will create a powerful combination. But it’s not immediately clear how NVDA intends to leverage having ARM under their own ownership, and will expect that vision to be part of the company’s presentation. ""The presentation notes that NVDA intends to continue ARM’s open licensing model and NVDA IP would also be added to ARM’s licensing business. That could certainly become additive to the revenue for the total licensing business, but more details will need to be provided to understand the potential revenue synergies."" ""The transaction requires regulatory approval the U.K., China, the European Union and the United States. China approval will naturally be viewed as a risk given US/China trade tensions. Since ARM IP is the foundation of nearly all handsets and IOT devices, we would expect the deal to be highly scrutinized, and we would expect that NVDA would need to provide assurances that it will continue an open licensing model. NVDA is an ARM licensee, but ARM processors is a small part of NVDA’s business, limited to the automotive business (3% of revenue) and the Nintendo Switch custom processor (4% of revenue, by our estimates). Therefore, since there is a very small part of revenue in which NVDA competes with ARM licensees, we don’t expect that to raise significant regulatory concerns.""","I would speculate on increasing stock price too but not in the short term looking at how many gains we already saw in 2020 (!). A short/mid term option bet could go either way. For the stock, I expect some sideways movement over the next few months and when things gain traction perhaps a new rise. if sentiment remains favourable.Also the regulatory approval is a thing that needs to be considered. From a EU perspective all these sales of European innovation to tech giants abroad is not such a smart move, but then again such deals went through over and over so as a citizen I wouldn't expect them to block the transaction this time.",0,0.554,NEGATIVE,1.0
