,"The stock continues a downward trend, with PE ratio around 10. I understand that the games have been very underwelming... but they have a huge cataloge of untouched gems: Splinter Cell, Rainbow Six, Prince of Persia 3D, Rayman, Rabbids, The Crew, Watch Dogs, Driver, Trials, and Brother In Arms. Not to mention the yearly hits like Assassins Creed, Just Dance, and Far Cry. They're management is frustratingly confusing now, but the yearly franchise should keep them kicking. If they develop one of the others as a hit could have the stock take off. Also there are talks of a buyout from management. I believe this stock could be a three-banger, thoughts?","Yearly ""hits"" like assassins creed.Ubisoft has negative moat. Players resent ubisoft more and more every year.",0,0.547,NEGATIVE,0.668
