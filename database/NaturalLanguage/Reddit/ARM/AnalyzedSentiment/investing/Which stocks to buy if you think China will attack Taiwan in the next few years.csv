,"While many people do not take China's ambitions to annex Taiwan seriously or even ridicule them, military experts are certain that China will force a military reunification from 2027 to 2030 at the latest if no peaceful settlement has taken place by then. There are various reasons for this, which have also been set out in a DOD document. President Xi Jinping's ""cult of personality"" and his historical goal Xi has pursued the goal of ""reunifying"" China, including Taiwan, since coming to power in 2012. In order to secure his historical role and political legacy, he may want to annex Taiwan by force during his lifetime if peaceful measures fail. Xi's third term and the possibility of lifelong leadership reinforce this incentive. The ""completion"" of the Chinese nation would be a symbolic legacy, similar to the successes of Mao Zedong. Modernization of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) by 2027 The PLA has set significant modernization goals by 2027 to prepare it for military engagement around Taiwan. By building advanced armed forces and increasing its military presence in the Taiwan region, China could aim for ""rapid annexation"" to minimize international intervention and isolate Taiwan. Demographic pressure and window of opportunity China's population is aging rapidly, which could create long-term economic and military challenges. Between 2027 and the early 2030s, before these demographic problems become more acute, Xi sees a ""window of opportunity"" for invasion. This would allow him to achieve his political goal before domestic political and economic problems complicate such an operation. And now coming to the shares... The stocks should have as little exposure to China or Taiwan as possible. Neither in terms of supply chains, nor in terms of China or Taiwan as a sales market for the company in question. Furthermore, the company should benefit from the attack, e.g. because it is active in the western defence sector and will receive more government funding after the attack, or because it will substitute Chinese products after trade relations with China have been severed. At best, the share should not yet be valued too expensively. It is very difficult to find suitable companies. Most defence stocks are already very expensively valued due to the war in Ukraine and Israel, and the probable easing of tensions until at least 2027 will result in financial losses. Boeing is still relatively favourably valued, although the military sector only accounts for 30% of total sales and 20% of civil aviation orders come from China. Automobile manufacturers that are hardly represented on the Chinese market, such as Stellantis, could also be of interest. However, this would of course cause major supply chain difficulties. For many, Intel would probably be the best guess. Intel currently still generates 30% of its sales in China, but the Chinese government wants to remove foreign chips from strategically relevant components by 2027 anyway, so the resulting loss of sales may already be priced in. The question remains to what extent Intel would suffer from supply chain issues in the event of a trade disruption with China. I wanted to give a suggestion with my post and open up the possibility for discussion. Which stocks do you think are most likely to benefit from this likely massive geopolitical event? U.S.-American mining companies? Semiconductor producers? Steel producers?",INTC,0,0.505,POSITIVE,0.555

I wanted to give a suggestion with my post and open up the possibility for discussion. Which stocks do you think are most likely to benefit from this likely massive geopolitical event? U.S.-American mining companies? Semiconductor producers? Steel producers?","Thats an optimist view. The pessimist view would be that China sees a half assed western support for ukraine about to deteriorate even more depending on the elections tomorrow. Meanwhile Korea is ready to send many more slave soldiers that could make the difference if we don't support ukraine enough.And then, is it merely a philosophical victory ? We are no longer selling China high tech chipmachines. Taiwan produces them for us. Conquering Taiwan would greatly hurt us and maybe* enable them to capture those facilities and use them for their own benefit.*unlikely i guess since they are very hard to operate and taiwan might not cooperate / sabotage them.

,"While many people do not take China's ambitions to annex Taiwan seriously or even ridicule them, military experts are certain that China will force a military reunification from 2027 to 2030 at the latest if no peaceful settlement has taken place by then. There are various reasons for this, which have also been set out in a DOD document. President Xi Jinping's ""cult of personality"" and his historical goal Xi has pursued the goal of ""reunifying"" China, including Taiwan, since coming to power in 2012. In order to secure his historical role and political legacy, he may want to annex Taiwan by force during his lifetime if peaceful measures fail. Xi's third term and the possibility of lifelong leadership reinforce this incentive. The ""completion"" of the Chinese nation would be a symbolic legacy, similar to the successes of Mao Zedong. Modernization of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) by 2027 The PLA has set significant modernization goals by 2027 to prepare it for military engagement around Taiwan. By building advanced armed forces and increasing its military presence in the Taiwan region, China could aim for ""rapid annexation"" to minimize international intervention and isolate Taiwan. Demographic pressure and window of opportunity China's population is aging rapidly, which could create long-term economic and military challenges. Between 2027 and the early 2030s, before these demographic problems become more acute, Xi sees a ""window of opportunity"" for invasion. This would allow him to achieve his political goal before domestic political and economic problems complicate such an operation. And now coming to the shares... The stocks should have as little exposure to China or Taiwan as possible. Neither in terms of supply chains, nor in terms of China or Taiwan as a sales market for the company in question. Furthermore, the company should benefit from the attack, e.g. because it is active in the western defence sector and will receive more government funding after the attack, or because it will substitute Chinese products after trade relations with China have been severed. At best, the share should not yet be valued too expensively. It is very difficult to find suitable companies. Most defence stocks are already very expensively valued due to the war in Ukraine and Israel, and the probable easing of tensions until at least 2027 will result in financial losses. Boeing is still relatively favourably valued, although the military sector only accounts for 30% of total sales and 20% of civil aviation orders come from China. Automobile manufacturers that are hardly represented on the Chinese market, such as Stellantis, could also be of interest. However, this would of course cause major supply chain difficulties.
