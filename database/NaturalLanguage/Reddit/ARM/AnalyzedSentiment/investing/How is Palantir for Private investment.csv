Consumer tech companies are valued richly because of exponential sales growth but that is nearly impossible to do for enterprise software companies. Large clients take a long time to win (2-5 years), you need lots of sales people, lots of service engineers (which reduces economy of scales). As a whole, these businesses tend to be slow and steady (just look at how old IBM is). Unless you have high visibility into some big client wins or something really significant (enterprise useful AI) that can be pushed through their channel, then I think the current valuation is a bit too high.Think about it this way, if you make USD50-100 million per year from the CIA and Special Forces command contracts, it will take you finding 10-20 CIAs and Special Forces commands to generate a billion in sales, and how many of those can you sign up in a year?",0,0.572,NEGATIVE,0.999
