,"There are many discussions on Reddit about IPOs in general. These are usually focusing on companies going public for the first time. ARM is a very different story. This is about a company which used to be public, then went private and now (after a failed acquisition by NVDA) it's going to be public again. Companies such as Apple, Samsung, Intel and Nvidia have been reported to buy into this company to get some control. Let's talk about this opportunity. What's people sentiment about this IPO? What's considered a fair units price? What's the market sentiment about this company? What are the options to get into this IPO?","It’s very hyped up so most likely it will follow many similar ipo that went up massively and then down a lot near the pandemic bubble.In other words, i woudnt take any rational thought as to why buying the stocks at x price making sense when everything will be emotional/fomo/hype.Apple showed us that the tech is the future of personal computers.It could go like Tesla and stay up or crash like many we forgot.",0,0.515,NEGATIVE,1.0

I see news that they plan to list in the US so I presume as an ADR.My google-fu and edgar-fu is failing me. Do you have a link to the F-1 filing? Or is Arm only at the confidential filing phase?I'm guessing that they are doing the IPO to capitalize on the current AI hype.,0,0.541,NEGATIVE,0.999
