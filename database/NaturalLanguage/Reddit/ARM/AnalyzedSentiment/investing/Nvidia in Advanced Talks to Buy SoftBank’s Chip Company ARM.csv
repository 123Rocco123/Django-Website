But maybe NVDA has a plan to challenge Intel with an arm+gpu combo for datacenters for certain workloads. I don't know if there is a big enough market for those types of workloads though. Also ARM CPUs and NVDA GPUs are mostly on the opposite ends of the power/performance spectrum. It'd be a tough integration.One thing for NVDA is though, they'd certainly save on licensing costs (heh!) and this could be advantegous in the auto market. Tegra (now with lower costs) + GPU can be sold to auto companies as a package, even if they'd probably reside on different boards.",1,0.525,NEGATIVE,1.0

Many, MANY tasks still only run on 1 core, and this fraction of a fraction of a second is what makes one high frequency trader win out over another, for enough to make the costs of the silicon meaningless.I'm personally a bit bias because I code in Python, where unless specifically trying to do otherwise, everything runs in 1 core. So even on a half work half play machine, I still go Intel for being faster on my tasks.It's important to mention Xeon Vs. i5 is about margin, and whoever has the slight single core competitive edge will get to charge it.Think about that Intel is still somehow making competitive chips among the obvious shitstorm of bad decision/news from Intel. Now remember they still haven't actually shrunk down to their 10nm (which is very similar to tsmc's 7nm). If they can take some of the magic they're using to squeeze their 14nm for all this performance into 10nm, then right off the bat it may be an instant turnaround for who makes the fastest chips.Am I salty and clearly lost money in Intel?
