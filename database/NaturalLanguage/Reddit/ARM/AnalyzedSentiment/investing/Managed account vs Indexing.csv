,"My mother, who is 78, has her investments (mostly non-registered) managed by the private investment arm of one of the big 5 Canadian banks for 25 years. Their returns have been around 5% after fees of ~1.2%. Each year I wonder if she should cut them loose and just create a DIY portfolio of SPY ETF and a bond ETF. She definitely would've had higher returns that way, as their stock picking hasn't been great for the equity portion (50%). My question is, should she cut ties with the portfolio management approach in favour of a DIY approach? A concern is there would be a large capital gains tax to pay by having to liquidate all those equity positions, some of which have been held for many years with unrealized gains. In other words, would the short-term pain be worth the potential longer-term (10 years?) gain? I suppose on her death she would have a capital gains tax liability anyway...","Did your mother ask for your advice? If not I would leave it alone.If Canada has similar rules to the USA she should be able to transfer her existing mutual funds, stocks and bonds to another broker without selling them. If the capital gains would be too much she could turn off dividend reinvestment for those funds/stocks and put any new money into index funds with lower expense ratios.r/PersonalFinanceCanada would be a better place to ask this if you want Canada specific advice.",0,0.523,NEGATIVE,0.999

I was saying if they do not want to sell due to that they could stop reinvesting the dividends of their current mutual funds and stocks and use them to buy something else like SPY.That way at least any distributions are being directed to better investment options.,2,0.53,NEGATIVE,1.0

That's a decent approach. Plus new money like TFSA contributions could go into SPY. You made me think she could maybe even sell losing positions, and sell bits off even where there are gains over a few years to spread out any capital gains and keep within desirable tax brackets.

If she has portions of her stock and mutual fund holdings that have capital losses she could sell that portion. Unless Canada has different tax rules for this than the US.You should go to a Canada focused finance subreddit for questions like this. You aren’t going to get great answers around Canadian tax laws here.Edit: btw you probably don’t even want SPY.

I can already see how this would play out: she goes to self management, market crashes and she gets concerned and pulls out, never gets back in and misses out on the recovery, etc. Just leave it be, it sounds like the management firm is actually adding value for her.",0,0.544,NEGATIVE,1.0

I just keep thinking, if only we had just bought ETFs, at least the equity portion of her portfolio would be so much further ahead. They're stock picking has far underperformed the index, because they don't invest in FAANGs or the Magnificent 7 due to unjustifiable valuations.",1,0.531,NEGATIVE,0.955
