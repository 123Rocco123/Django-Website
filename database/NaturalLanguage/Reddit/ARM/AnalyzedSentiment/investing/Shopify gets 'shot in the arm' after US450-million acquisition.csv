Shopify gives you the tools to build your very own online store, while Amazon lets you sell through its marketplace alongside other online sellers.So selling through Amazon is like having a stall in a famous boot-fair. Thousands of people swarm in to browse and buy – most of them aren’t looking for your business in particular, but you still make a lot of sales because of everyone walking past and seeing your stall. Selling with Shopify is more like renting a building to set up your business in. You have your own space and customers actually come looking for your store once they know your brand. There’s more room to create a unique image, although it’s harder work building up that regular customer base.Because of these differences, Shopify and Amazon cater for different types of online sellers. Amazon caters for individual sellers up to small and medium sized businesses. Shopify is ideal for everything from small businesses up to much larger brands.",5,0.527,POSITIVE,0.941

They aren't amazon, and the analysts who think they are, or even could be, seemingly understand nothing about who uses the platform and what shopify actually is.I personally will never suggest a client goto SHOP after dealing with their highest level of service - Shopify Plus.Just the two cents of a person who has extensive experience with the platform...to each their own of course.",2,0.524,NEGATIVE,1.0

Use 'site:yoursite.com' in google to see what random pages shopify has decided to create and index for you!All urls were accessable via yoursite.com and yoursite.myshopify.com (this might have changed but can you say duplicate content?)Little to no sitemap/robots controlNot full control over urls/very messy variant urlsAll the sites are hosted on the same class of IPs - big lack of diversityNo access to server logs to figure out what is actually happening to a visitor beyond their basic analytics or your own third party toolsThe wild west world of shopify apps which all integrate differently and have no standards can create search issues that you dont find until way too late.I pretty sure they dont understand what a canonical url actually is and what its supposed to be used for.Does not handle dynamic image resizing in a nice way - which causes speed issuesNo real caching policies - speed issuesWith that being said, they could have addressed these things, and there now might be ways to deal with them via an app or something - but as a technical SEO platform, it leaves a LOT to be desired.
