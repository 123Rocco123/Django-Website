,"Hi Everyone - my parents have a financial advisor who isn't doing anything for them. I am encouraging them to get their accounts transferred to a brokerage where I can help them manage. All they have are some MFs that are sitting there, nothing fancy. My parents are pretty old school with not trusting ""the internet"" and things like that... very frustrating, lol. I know some big banks have investment arms JPM, BAC, WF. Fidelity and Schwab have offices, but their support may be limited in branch. Does anyone know if they wanted to go in person to talk to a human face to face for help with their brokerage accounts, does JPM, BAC, WF have the ability to do so, or would they just say ""Please call this customer support number""?",Brokers don't provide advisory services. That is the definition of a broker-dealer in the US.And yes - some brokerages have branches. Those branches are for advisors and for brokerage support.For brokerage support - for example - I occasionally have to go into a Fidelity branch to do a wire or swift transfer. That is a convenience for me because they can do an in-person authorization faster without a medallion signature guarantee. But when the wire has to be sent - the rep simply calls the wire desk and authenticates that the wire is authorized by me. But I still have to give the wire desk on the phone my wire instructions directly.So - if your parents simply need to go into the branch to have someone explain stuff to them about their brokerage account - yes - they can do that at a branch. But they are likely to just ask your parents to call the customer support line. It also depends on the size of the account. For example - Schwab can assign a dedicated named rep which they call a financial consultant who may be willing to help your parents with certain tasks.Bear in mind that broker-assisted trades will have an extra fee.Also - a broker rep won't offer investing or tax advice unless your parents have an advisory account and your parents are meeting with an IAR (investment advisor representative).Your best bet is to call around on behalf of your parents and ask the various brokers that you are considering.,0,0.519,0.997,NEGATIVE
