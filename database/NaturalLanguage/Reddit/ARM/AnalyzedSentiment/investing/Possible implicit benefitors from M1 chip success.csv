,"The impressing performance of Apple’s new M1 chip may bring attention from other hardware producers to start adapting the ARM architecture. I suspect that there are companies that will greatly benefit from this, and I would like a discussion on what kind of companies as well as any specific stocks that you think will go up due to this. The first thing that comes to mind would be ARM-based servers. What are your thoughts?","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

I know $GOOG has shown interest in custom ARM chips for their Pixel devices and they're a major player in cloud services so they would have a massive advantage over AWS ($AMZN) and Azure ($MSFT). $QCOM is the closest to making a chip comparable to M1.,0,0.529,NEGATIVE,0.755

What are your thoughts?","Really the biggest problem is for servers you want performance in as small as space more than anything else energy efficiency is only important if electric and cooling is very expensive, but it's not server farms now are incredibly efficient. Laptops battery life is more important. The benchmarks apple is using like single thread performance does not matter with severs at all. If companies want something more efficient they use fpga or specialized chip made specific for the work load they are targeting. Think google tpu.",4,0.519,NEGATIVE,1.0

It does not have to apply to all other companies, but if there is a single one, I would be interested in exploring the option to invest.Do you not think other companies have adapted any of boeings technology decisions and profited from it? :)",0,0.534,NEGATIVE,0.99
