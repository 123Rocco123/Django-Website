,"I believe we might have a sleeper here in NVIDIA. The stock has moved sideways for a while since the ARM acquisition is on standby pending antitrust reviews in several countries and the outlook is rather negative on the subject because of complications with ARM China. This vaguely reminds me of Tesla initially being denied inclusion in the S&P 500, the stock went flat and down for a few months and the market was ""surprised"" when S&P eventually included them, which they could have done at any time. Also I think they are poised to capture a good chunk of self driving with a system similar to Tesla based on vision (no lidar) and machine learning (not geofenced), which doesn't seem priced in.

Edit/disclaimer: I am long NVDA ~ 10% of portfolio","My view is this was a dumb acquisition. Sorry for the ramblings below - it's still early and I need more coffee:I like both ARM and NVDA but the two of them being in one company hampers ARM's core strength: They're a design house, not an SOC vendor. There are a lot of ARM vendors out there precisely because of that - they don't have to approach ARM as a potential competitor that they need to do business with. They know their business interests are aligned.NVDA buying ARM changes this dynamic. Sure, the regulators will ask NVDA to put all kinds of firewalls around ARM not to affect other ARM vendors. But even that won't be enough IMO.Meanwhile, if NVDA wants to utilize ARM's personnel to design their own SOCs (say, like Apple), well, that works well if you're not planning to sell your chips (say, like Apple!) A marketable core needs to have the tradeoffs you need when you sell to multiple customers. So I don't see why NVDA would need direct access to ARM to design and sell a custom SOC or anything like that. Doesn't make much sense to me.Mergers usually fail to realize the rosy projections.
