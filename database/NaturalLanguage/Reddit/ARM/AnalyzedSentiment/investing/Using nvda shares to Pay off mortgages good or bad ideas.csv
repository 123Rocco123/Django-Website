,"My mortgage is an ARM that resets the rate to 7.885% in september. I have roughly the same worth amount of nvda shares plus a few other stocks and index funds. The nvda shares alone can pay off the mortgage balance If you were me, would you pay off your 7.89mortgages using proceeds from nvda shares? If not selling nvda, would you pay it off with cash. i also have about same amount of cash at sideline. I do have 12 month emergency funds in t bills, so not in a big urgent need for that cash 06 29 Edit: Thanks every one who replied. This post gave me great insights. Based on every remarkable reply in this post, here is the adjusted decision.. ( i was proning to completely pay off using sideline cash). Here is the adjusted decision I will pay 1/2 to 2/3 outstanding mortgage balance with cash on hands. I will leave the rest 1/2 to 1/3 to reset to the higher 7.885% rate. Reason being: 1) Last 30 year s&p average return is 10% ish a year. I have a good opportunity for the 2% opportunity gain in next a few years which I belive we are still in a cyclical bull market and has more than 50% chance to gain double digit next years. 2) the 7.885% reset would stay 12month only. i believe FED will cut rate soon, so the 7.885% would reset to a 7% apr in 2025 September and even further down in 2026. Then the opportunity gain for Not payinb off will be greater in 2025. 3) My NVDA shares would have tax implications and it’s really not worth selling at this level. 4) I need a small mortgage to prevent real estate fraud. A mortgaged house usually won’t get scammed since banks have crazy checks on documents.. I won’t pay off that loan until 2050… lol","All down to your own risk appetite, but for me there's one guaranteed thing and it's that the mortgage is a guaranteed rate that you're going to pay, while the NVDA holdings could go either way.",0,0.511,POSITIVE,0.692

If you keep your NVDA share, it could go down 50-70%, or go up or whatever. That's the risk. To compensate for that downside risk possibility, your upside returns need to be much higher than 8% annualized, at least 12%, but more like 15-20% annualized. That's called risk premium.You're talking about a stock that went up 15x in 1.5 years without even a 50% pull back.
