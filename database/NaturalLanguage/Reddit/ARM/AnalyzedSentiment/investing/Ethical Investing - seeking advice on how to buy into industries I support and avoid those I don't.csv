,"I want to invest in industries/businesses I personally support and avoid those I don't. But I also see how the companies that I don't support are perfectly poised to be industry leaders in the fields I do support. For example, I do not support fossil fuels, but rather want to focus on renewable energy. I say this knowing full well that ExxonMobil or Shell would be first in line to shift their entire business strategy to wind/solar as soon as it becomes the more profitable option. Same with cannabis and tobacco. I hate cigarettes and fully support cannabis legalization and want to ride that wave up to the top. But I just know Philip Morris is gonna move a significant portion of their production line to cannabis once the government makes it feasible to be the biggest player in that field. And in terms of defense and arms stocks, I hate guns and war. Yet I know that peace isn't possible without countries arming themselves to the teeth to prevent invasion, and fully support the defense of Ukraine and Israel. Plus, you can't really buy ""peace"" stocks. Add to this the fact that the majority of desirable index funds and ETFs all include those less-ethical stocks (and crypto which I also hate). I don't see any reasonable way to avoid them without cherrypicking stocks like I'm shopping at the financial equivalent of a health food store. Has anyone else pondered this dilemma and have any advice?","We share similar values, but this is a fool’s errand in my opinion. I invest in hopes of living comfortably when I’m older, so I invest in whatever I think will make that most likely knowing that whatever comparatively small sums I personally am able to put into any of these companies won’t make any considerable difference sociopolitically",0,0.517,NEGATIVE,0.996

You're saying its immoral but you do it too but only because you personally profit. As if the companies don't exist for profit as well? Look, companies make money by providing value that people willing pay for and in general investing is ethical because you are deferring consumption to make goods/services more abundant in the future, to improve quality of life. Even fossil fuels companies, do you drive a car? Buy things that get delivered by truck/train? then you benefit from oil. Yeah they pollute but I doubt you'd trade modern comforts to live a 1700s pre-industrial life style. Or you can give all your money to charity of you want.",2,0.538,NEGATIVE,0.996

Has anyone else pondered this dilemma and have any advice?","First, thanks for your post--I really appreciated it bc you essentially articulated exactly how I feel and didn't know how to explain to my new financial manager. So now I'm gonna send it to him!Did you ever see the show ""The Good Place""? The character Chidi was a great example of how we can't be perfectly ethical, which many of the naysayers in this thread point out (some kindly, some more rudely). I think I'm landing on ""something is better than nothing."" So I think asking these questions and others for their strategies is a great starting place that will eventually help us hammer out a strategy that works for us (e.g. having a 'blacklist'; making the maximum return and donating to your desired charities etc.) and I certainly appreciate the discussion.That said, I still wonder along with you if there's a better way to invest, for those who are interested. I wonder about things like: 1) dedicating 10% of my portfolio to specific stocks (vs. funds) that are as ethical as I can find--maybe not perfect, but 'good enough' or that I know work towards an industry that may lose money right now but need investors in order to grow (e.g. green energy/cancer cures) and consider any losses part of the decision and take the write-off if/when I sell 2) along the same lines, whereas I've been a lifelong ""buy funds and hold them until you die"" hardliner, I'm beginning to shift my perspective and recognize that if I want to have a larger influence thru my investing, I'm going to have to be more than a bit more intentional and put more effort into researching companies and cherrypicking rather than just signing off on a 'package' of stocks in a fund and waiting for the money to roll in. I certainly don't have the time to create my own portfolio individual stock by stock, but I think it's time to branch out from solely holding 5 funds, which is what I've done in the past.Like anything else in life worth having, ethics and pondering how to take ethical action is hard work with no guarantee of positive results. But the alternative is sitting back, throwing rocks at those who try, doing nothing ""bc it's pointless""--with an absolute 100% guarantee of a negative outcome. The problem with the latter seems to be that there is no room for nuance, whereas ethics absolutely requires it.I say keep on asking the hard questions bc the more of us who do the little bits we can, the more we have ""something"" instead of ""nothing."" Please keep us updated if you hear of any other great ideas or strategies to try out.",0,0.532,NEGATIVE,1.0

Has anyone else pondered this dilemma and have any advice?","I’m an investment manager and wealth advisor and get this question a lot. It’s a tricky one because:ESG investing - the catch-all term for the type of ethically minded investing you mention- is still relatively new and there’s no universal consensus around what constitutes “ethical” “sustainable” etc. so one investment company may use metrics or filters you agree with, another may not.As you allude to, with companies growing ever-larger in reach both geographically and in revenue channels and industry exposure, it’s very hard to truly limit involvement in an industry you don’t align with, not just now but in the future.This tends to be an arena where (all other pros and cons aside) active funds have a slight edge over passive in that they are more able to pivot on company screens and exposure, and may also have the weight in percentage ownership of a company to enact real change (unlike you or I who will never have a voice with such small ownership). One such active fund company takes the position of changing things from the inside as opposed to total avoidance which could in another way be akin to complacency.Owning only stocks you completely agree with may not get you the type of diversification sound long term investment strategy demands, and then again, agree with how?Ultimately it’s about your own ethical and moral lines in the sand and reasoning rather than a perfect investing strategy to accomplish what you’d like (at least at this stage of the trend). It sounds like you’re already working through that, which is sound intuition.",0,0.544,NEGATIVE,0.648

And even if solar or whatever is the future, it won't help your returns if you don't pick the right company. And the right company might not even exist yet.A couple of years ago, Warren Buffet talked about how in 1900, everyone knew that the automobile was the future. But there were 2000 automobile manufacturers you could invest in then...because you have to invest in companies - not in ""cars"", and not in the future. By 1950, there were only 5 auto manufacturers. So even being right about ""the future"" an putting your money where your mouth was...you would still have to choose the right company.The best thing to do is what everyone else is suggesting - invest in broad based funds and use your own money to donate specifically to causes that are important to you.
