This is an easily discredited take.We've had shit relations with china and cyber attacks from them for years. Not only are they expanding to the south sea but also they're basically recolonizing africa with the OBOR plan. If this was all hostile takeovers maybe but it seems like they're pushing their weight around as the usual and taking advantage of easily swayed/corruptable politics.

And also add this:I don't think roulette rolling on an outcome of an election, likelihood of war, disasters, etcetc is actual investing. That feels more speculative semi-long trading rather than ""investing"" in my book. I'll note that some can make money that way and there is nothing wrong with doing that if you so choose, but it's not ""good investing"" in my book.It's better to use your time look for and invest in companies with strong fundamentals and long term positive trends. IMO LMT, RTX, BA, and NOC are pretty nicely valued and undervalued compared to other areas like tech. I've been looking at them myself.I do think something to look into is differentiating the companies by which ones specialize in digital technology and cyber security since that might be a continuing trend in US defense regardless of administration. Also another factor is exposure and reliance on their aerospace industry since there seems to be more competition in that area from every Billionaire/RichGuy starting some SPAC/company with space ambitions: SpaceX, Virgin, Blue origins, etcetc.",1,0.535,NEGATIVE,0.999

The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $525 million for government satellite programs due to higher volume (primarily Next Gen OPIR); and about $430 million for strategic and missile defense programs due to higher volume (primarily hypersonic development programs, inclusive of impacts due to the acquisition of i3's hypersonics portfolio in November 2020).Spaceâ€™s operating profit in 2020 decreased $42 million, or 4%, compared to 2019. Operating profit decreased approximately $90 million for government satellite programs due to lower risk retirements on the various programs (primarily AEHF) that were partially offset by higher risk retirements and volume on the Next Gen OPIR program. This decrease was partially offset by increases of $40 million for commercial satellite programs due to charges recorded for performance matters in 2019 not repeated in 2020. Operating profit for strategic and missile defense programs was comparable as higher risk retirements and volume on hypersonic development programs were offset by lower risk retirements and volume on fleet ballistic missile programs. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were $100 million lower in 2020 compared to 2019.Backlog decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to higher sales on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years. Additionally, backlog as of December 31, 2020 reflects a decrease due to the UK Ministry of Defenseâ€™s intent to assume 100% ownership of the program on June 30, 2021.We expect Spaceâ€™s 2021 net sales to increase in the low-single digit percentage range from 2020 levels driven by higher volume on hypersonics programs and on government satellite programs (primarily Next Gen OPIR), partially offset by lower volume at AWE due to the UK Ministry of Defenseâ€™s intent to re-nationalize the program on June 30, 2021. Operating profit is expected to decrease in the low-single digit percentage range from 2020 levels. Operating profit margin for 2021 is expected to be lower than 2020 levels.To date, the effects of COVID-19 have not had a significant negative impact on our liquidity, cash flows or capital resources. ""87% of LM Space's net sales are US Government customers and 13% are international. Overall, compared to Lockheed's entire portfolio, commercial space is a very small percentage and also doesn't seem to match up with your claims anyways.Also, I don't know why you're providing an example of Raytheon's F-35 contract in a comparison to Lockheed when Lockheed is the prime contractor. There may certainly be a case for Raytheon over Lockheed, but I don't feel like you've provided it.",0,0.55,NEGATIVE,0.97

The reasons were operational and financial. It didn't make sense to intercept primarily home-made rockets, whose physical damage was limited to the landing spot (the mental effects were much more significant), with the expensive Patriot missiles. Furthermore, Patriot missiles cannot really intercept Qassam rockets (and even not Katyusha rockets, which are used mostly by Hezbollah to the north), and thus it would have been a waste.The residents of the area were expected to head to the shelter within varying levels of seconds until the rockets landed.The rest of your analysis is very informative and well put.
