How is this going to change how you invest?","Depends. As someone who has worked at various firms, I can tell you there is a lot of financial engineering going on. Let me explain. Closed end funds use IRR as a performance metric, which works largely off of datesand amounts of contributions and distributions. The less often you call capital and the more often you distribute, the higher your return. So how do firms manipulate this? Instead of calling capital they take on debt. That doesnt count towards IRR, so you can get situations where a fund distributes money and has very little in terms of contributions. That blows up returns to make them much higher on the surface than they really are. There’s a lot of tactics like that.",2,0.514,NEGATIVE,1.0
