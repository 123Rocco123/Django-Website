Edit: People thought I meant general firearms companies, I’m talking about military arms companies like LM or Boeing","It's not a stupid theory but be aware that you probably don't know more than other market actors. So you have to make a better judgement than the overall market, not just be aware of the fact that ""tensions are rising"".I think looking at Europe could be interesting. There's been a lot of talk in the European Parliament about increased military cooperation now that our largest ally in NATO is, how shall I put this, less reliable on matters concerning our biggest threat.Many European armies (especially those of the smaller countries) are underfunded and wholly unprepared for any serious war. We've been banking on the assumption that the US/Britain/France will save us under NATO for a few decades now. Now Germany (in its entirety) is a reliable force, but the US is acting really confused in regards to Russia and Britain is obviously not moving closer to the EU.Remember that we don't have much in terms on nukes if we can't use the NATO weapons. Without Britain, only France has nukes. So a conventional army is important. If we are going to operate on the assumption that we have to stand for our own defence, spending has to go up.",0,0.523,NEGATIVE,1.0

Edit: People thought I meant general firearms companies, I’m talking about military arms companies like LM or Boeing","What you're missing is the possibility that everybody else already knows that so nobody is going to sell you the stocks at a price where you can expect an excess return over the rest of the market.When you buy an asset in a secondary market, you're not betting on the performance of the underlying asset but on the performance of the asset relative to the price you paid for it.",2,0.54,NEGATIVE,0.971

Edit: People thought I meant general firearms companies, I’m talking about military arms companies like LM or Boeing","Yes, but if it gets too high it tends to fall.Again, you have to have a reason to believe it is too high. Just because the stock price goes up, doesn't mean that it is ""too high."" Just look at amazon's chart, people said it was too high and it had gone up too much when it was at $350. Or NVDA, which people said had gone up too much at $100.",6,0.582,NEGATIVE,1.0

Edit: People thought I meant general firearms companies, I’m talking about military arms companies like LM or Boeing","Would you mind sharing some of your impressions of the business?I ask because I have not looked at their books, but I've been considering a buy and hold also. Without turning this into a US politics debate, I think the Republicans are going to suffer some setbacks in upcoming elections which generally helps gun manufacturers.I think the wildcard is a mass shooting inspired regulatory shift that severely damages Sturm's business operations.",1,0.537,NEGATIVE,0.984
,"I feel like with the tensions now it could be profitable, am I being stupid? Edit: People thought I meant general firearms companies, I’m talking about military arms companies like LM or Boeing","The first thing that jumps off the paper at me, and where I'd suggest starting your research is with their share buybacks. Quarter in, and quarter out, they demonstrate discipline in the price they're willing to pay for the buybacks - typically at or below $50/share. 2016's annual results are a thing of beauty: They had exactly four days the entire year where shares traded below $50, yet they had the discipline to only repurchase on those days.From their Q4 2016 press releasethe repurchase of 283,343 shares of our common stock in the open market at an average price of $49.43 per share, for a total of $14 million.Similarly, take a look at their most recent annual report. When their share price has been the lowest its been in years is when they let loose with cash, and bought back 7.5% of their market cap. Truly disciplined.Buybacks are good, but they're great when the stock is undervalued. I lump gun manufacturers into the same camp as tobacco and alcohol stocks, in that, because no one wants them, and the outlook is always so pessimistic, it creates an opportunity for share buybacks to really turbocharge returns when the price appreciates even modestly in the future. And that happens because no one wants to buy them.Take Blackrock's ""Approach to Companies that Manufacture and Distribute Civilian Firearms,"" in which they state that they own no gun manufacturers in any of their actively managed accounts, because of ""guidelines agreed to by clients."" That's how tobacco stocks have been perennially undervalued for decades, and it works here, too - big money stays away when its convenient. I actually think it'd be pretty interesting to dig into 13-Fs of major owners. Just pulling up the Morningstar list of owners, it's not the usual BlackRock/Vanguard/Fidelity collectively owning some 20% of the company. It's a lot of Voya and Invesco and such...anyway, I digress.I think a good way to think about Sturm Ruger if you want a handle on the company, is to describe what it is not. It's not Remington, which is going through bankruptcy after private equity investors saddled it with almost $1 Billion of debt. I assume Remington and Ruger are about the same size, give or take, and imaging Ruger with $1 Billion of debt would make it an automatic no-go for me.Instead, Ruger has no debt, which is great because demand for guns is volatile, making sales cyclical. The ""Trump Slump"" in gun sales is very real, and I agree with this article - it's not going away anytime soon, since there's actually way more going on than just a gun-friendly government, including decreased demand and overstocked dealers. Because Ruger has no debt, (And outright owns two of their four manufacturing facilities, including their primary facility), I'm confident they'll weather the downturn in sales, which could last years.Ruger is also not Vista Outdoors or AOBC, both of which have branched out into manufacturing products other than guns, and have attempted to launch a ""sanitization"" of their names. They're ""outdoor enthusiast companies"", not ""gun manufacturers"" - or, at least that's what they want you to think. Only problem is, rather than mitigating the political risk inherent in gun manufacturers, it's just spreading that risk to their entire business model. Sturm Ruger is a direct play on gun manufacturing (and a pretty good one, too. They're either the number one, or number two company in terms of sales in most major categories of guns.) Yes, there's political risk. I wouldn't make Ruger more than, say, 5% of my portfolio due to that risk, but I think that not investing in Ruger over fears of political risk is not the right way to go.Ruger management has recently indicated that they might consider using some of their cash ($63 million on the balance sheet, and no liquidity issues) to buy ""something"" but are not any more forthcoming than that. If they buy, say, a minority stake in Remington, that'd be pretty cool. If they buy some non-gun business, I might be more skeptical. Most likely - they'll keep buying back their own stock.Some other fun data points. 30% of Ruger's sales come from recently developed products, putting their R&D and innovation efforts on par with 3M. Despite a share price that's all over the map (and sales, EBIT and net income that whipsaw with it), their book value keeps appreciating. Another thing I recently learned, guns are the only product sold to consumers that is beyond the reach of government intervention in the event of a defective product. For more on that, and the shoddy build quality of Taurus guns, I highly recommend reading this article from Bloomberg. I'm not a gun expert, but the general scuttlebutt I've heard is that Ruger's are solidly good - not always great, but good. Also, their 1022 format is the go-to for .22 rifles, and their revolvers regularly come up in recommendations for home defense guns. I've also yet to hear anything negative about their management - a solid group of people who embody the motto of the company.Anyway, sorry to be long and rambling, but those are the top observations I have on the company, and where I'd recommend starting your research.Edit: Happy Cake Day - please consider this post your gift!Edit: Fixed a typo, added emphasis. That share repurchase in 2016 is still one of the most impressive things I've ever seen.",2,0.546,POSITIVE,0.99
