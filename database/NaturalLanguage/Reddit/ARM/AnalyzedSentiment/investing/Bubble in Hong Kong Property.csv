The developer loans a further 30% roughly. Then they also give a small discount on the selling price. The final amount a buyer has to give for a new build directly from developer as first instalment is usually just 6-10%.The developers also aren’t noobs and funding bubbles, unit price for those developer builds is usually 20-25% higher than market price anyway.

So the 'real' purchase price of real estate is no doubt very, very high. However given the chronic undersupply of property, low mortgage rates and global investment demand a sharp correction is allegedly unlikely. This could change depending on the Sino-China trade war which could well lower the external investment demand, or due to further regulatory tightening (on top of the vacant occupancy tax on completed developments), which seems likely given the political pressure, and would also potentially cause a correction.In short I think that, whether HK is a bubble or not very much depends on how the trade war develops and whether regulations are introduced, but if both progress favourably I'm not sure that there will any big changes in the near future.",0,0.532,POSITIVE,0.865

""Privately owned"" land is actually a long term lease from the government, of which rent is payable, as is property tax, stamp duty, and in some cases, even capital gains. Here is the kicker: the higher property prices become, the more money the government takes in from these taxes. Both government and developers have a vested interest in ensuring that very little land is made available for development - and by all metrics, they are very doing just that. This will continue into the foreseeable future, especially as more mainlanders make their way to HK. These people are used to poor living conditions, and believe the wages are sufficient compensation. The market certainly has a bubble component, in that it is susceptible to market shocks. At the same time, there are fundamental reasons for the high prices. Despite the high prices and leverage, I see the mix as more stable than markets like Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.",0,0.527,NEGATIVE,0.991

It's the governments primary source of income.The HK government believes in open free markets and does not collect a lot of taxes. Their only other method of earning revenue is selling rights to land. Hong Kong is a small territory, but even then they only use about 20% of the livable space. The rest is normally withheld and only released for use when the government needs additional funds. Otherwise, they operate mostly by the selling and reselling of land rights.The government will probably never allow the real estate bubble to pop since they carefully monitor the supply.",0,0.517,POSITIVE,0.662

I don't quite remember how long the purchase process took, but currently the selling process can take upwards to 6 MONTHS.Right now our contract is 3 months, we've claimed the buyers deposit and it's already been 2 months. The wait is uncomfortable.The previous owners wife died in hospital, but both lived in the flat at some point I'm sure, these kinds of information must be detailed during sale as well, the Chinese have some superstitious beliefs of not wanting to purchase property if someone had died ON premises as idk ghosts or something might be spooky. So the value of said properties plummet.Now alot of the locals arent exactly well off, so there's government provided flats for them to either purchase or rent at a subsidised price. Said flats are quite compact and not exactly of the highest quality.Our flat isn't, it's part of a little circle of buildings and comes with nice gardens, country clubs, free buses to certain useful places. Naturally, the size and rent would be a bigger.Our first tenants were alright iirc, paid on time, left the place with some mild wear. Broke a light fixture and left some wall scuffings. When evicted they pleaded to stay for a bit longer so they could sort out another rental, despite a month or so notice.Our second and final tenants were asshats. Occasionally had payment issues, big family of 4 or something. During their tenancy, they :Broke my couch so bad it's unusable, leather torn and supports busted.Stole one of our beds for their child after moving out.Had sex or something on the master bed to the point the flat board support under the mattress was completely broken. Once again they get lazy during eviction, despite sufficient notice.But otherwise overall the experience is.... Alright. The flat was worth low 7 figures and has since doubled since purchase back in 2013/14. Pretty good investment but now it's too far from Oceania to manage. Note that currently during the waiting phase before handover the buyers are getting anxious and whatnot and saying they want to back out or whatever, but that's pretty normal I guess. Either way it's win win at this point for us, just a matter of time.",2,0.526,NEGATIVE,1.0
