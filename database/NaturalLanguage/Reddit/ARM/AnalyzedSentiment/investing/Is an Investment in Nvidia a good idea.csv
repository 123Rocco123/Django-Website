Fully expecting a vote off the island here. . . butThe only think you left off your list is the quality of the stellar management team, led by a co-founder who started the company 30 years ago and is still in the CEO chair (where else is that occurring?)My answer to your question is are you an investor or are you a trader?The logical thoughtful value based investment crowd will roll out the same song and dance about never growing into their PE or P/S blah blah blah.Traders will make an argument about volatility and the next movement, 1/2 are right and the other 1/2 are on the wrong side of the trade.I've been INVESTED in Nvidia for years. My reasoning when I got in was they were building something different, something with potential. Today their technology are nearly exclusively driving the biggest technology shift, projected life and GDP changing, the world has ever seen. Whether one believes in AI or not, machine learning is real. There is real utility and $Bs in new investments are being made that will monetize it. Nvidia has created a platform and an ecosystem with millions of developers all working on harvesting value for themselves or their companies in ways that weren't possible a few years ago. Nvidia is uniquely positioned in the middle of a technology explosion.If one believes that trend will continue, there is a ton of momentum behind the company. That momentum is backed up by stellar GMs, net profits, FCF and a massive forecast bump last quarter.Like all investments, one has to pick their timing (I was buying in January). I do think we're going to see pull back at some point, as this company demonstrates with regularity. But it's also possible we're having another 2016 moment where the gap never filled and so we're off to a new plateau.Investing is about patience, patience to get in and patience to hold. There is no question this company will be massive. +$15B in revs by Q4, $60B run rate, and likely $100B/yr within 3 years. I follow the technology with a religious fervor and there is no doubt the demand is there. Nvidia will grow into their valuation. Wall street rewards growth and that's whats happening right now.Last thought, competition: Despite the promises and seeming inevitability, there is no one threatening Nvidia's dominance in machine learning, not today and not in the next few years. It's because nvidia has created a platform (hardware+software) that anyone is having trouble challenging. That platform is evolving into an entire data center system (architecture and the software to run it) that only a dozen or two companies on earth are capable of building, but every single one of them is behind or missing some key components. Nvidia has all those components in their bag of tricks.But no one wants to hear about it. Probably because, like Cathie Wood, they missed the most obvious investment in the world.",0,0.547,NEGATIVE,0.901
