ARM is too entrenched in things like smartphones, and the benefits of switching to RISC are minimal.Where you can expect it to be dominant is embedded systems — things that are 'barely' computers: Home devices like smart light switches and thermostats, internet connected cameras, dyson vacuums, battery management systems, payment terminals.What RISC-V will enable is more of all the above, more cheaply.

It helps somewhat with lateral security. eg, it reduces some chance of one VM trying to impact another VM.But for the most part, everyone is dealing with it already with other means (typically intrusion detection) rather than take performance hits needed to completely get rid of the threat by disabling stuff like speculative execution.Folks can google ""speculative execution side-channel vulnerabilities"" for more info.You'll make more money investing in threat detection companies than RISC-V dev companies.",4,0.511,NEGATIVE,0.998

The hardware virtualization improves performance, security, etc.Basically the main thing I am talking about. And this isn't a stable or distributed product, yet. The only peopke with experience in this, are like the 11 global contributors to the OSP.So, running xen now, or not, SW xen VMs are just not the same topic as hardware virutualization of xen, and it's implications.Speculative is not, in general, a performance hit. And here is the BIGGIE: vulnerabilities? Not if it's hardware*!!!I anticipate, if companies would like to have a truly secure kernel, they will elect for this option (once mature), as it will be performance boosting, and surface area eliminating.Sorry I'm being breif on the whole thing, but you are right regarding xen as it currently stands, but I disagree regarding future implications.

Hard to interpret, but it seems like it is an open standard chip architecture mostly with emphasis on low-power consumption and security (mobile). It is meant to compete with ARM (Qualcomm snapdragon processors are ARM). There seems to be a concensus that this is better than the ARM architecture, which I have no problem believing.I don't understand their licensing model, but it looks like poison to any chip making company, even worse than open source is to software companies. I don't see it giving rise to a bunch of new chip companies because the cost of entry into that market is so high, and tying your hands with this weird opensource licensing would only increase uncertainty.I know Nvidia tried to buy ARM and now they are recruiting chip designers with CPU experience. I don't know what that means, but RISC-V is supposed to support vector operations, which is speed advantage of a GPU, presumably without the same amount of difficulty to implement (although even that is getting easier).

,"Investing in RISC V processor ecosystem Hi, I would like to know if anyone has advice on investing in the RISC V computer processor ecosystem? Companies like andes technology and SiFive etc? The thing is many companies working on risc v processors are either startups or havent IPOd. How is a common person able to directly or indirectly invest in such companies? Andes tech is Taiwanese btw I feel like riscv is where arm was at the beginning of the iphone and want to try to invest at the ground floor. Any pointers would be much appreciated.

In general, desktops and laptops use CPUs have an architecture called ""x86"" which is a proprietary architecture owned (and built) by Intel and AMD.Virtually all mobile devices use CPUs with an ""ARM"" architecture which is owned by ARM (which is in the process of being bought by NVIDIA, if they haven't already). ARM licenses it's architecture out to other chipmakers so you can see ARM CPUs made by companies like Qualcomm, Samsung and even Apple. However these companies must pay exorbitant fees to do this.RISC-V is a new CPU architecture that is an ""open standard"", meaning that anyone can use it for free. No single company owns RISC-V, but currently a company called SiFive is driving most of the development and commercialization of RISC-V, though other companies like Western Digital have started designing and building RISC-V chips for their own usage.
