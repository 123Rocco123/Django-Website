,"1st, not sorry for the bad pun. I'm a dad, and that's what I do. Ok, so Wells Fargo (WFC) was hit hard by the pandemic and unlike most other banks, WFC has underperformed in recent years. Not only did the pandemic hit them hard but fed regulations due to their fake accounts scandal really limited growth. They were primarily focused on commercial lending. Their investment banking was just a very small percentage of their operations. So when the pandemic hit, it hit WFC really hard. So the reasons I like WFC: As we come out of the pandemic, this focus on consumer lending should be an asset for WFC. Their new management has focused a lot on control measures so that there will not be another scandal. They are expanding their investment arm. They have lots of money in reserve for buybacks which could see the stock price climb. Also, they were one of the few big banks that cut their dividends. I expect that to return so not only with the price climb, I'll see extra revenue from dividends. They are cutting expenses. I got in when the price was around $28 a share. I think the stock could climb to prices pre-pandemic (40s/50s) and maybe even higher, this year or next. Their new CEO has proven good and brought necessary changes.

Most importantly the younger M/Z would avoid doing business with WFC.

This is not really specific to WFC, other than it having a larger exposure to consumer markets than other banks like JPM and GS which have greater exposure to corporate/investment banking.A lot of the points you listed are understandable but scream value trap to me. Stating that they were one of the few banks to cut/suspend their dividend is essentially saying ""they are in substantially worse shape than their competition."" Cutting the dividend is basically a last resort for any company because the stock gets dumped by income funds which many people have money in for retirement.Points 3 and 6 are kind of contradictory because expanding the investment arm is going to be hard if they're also trying to cut costs. Usually if a company says they're expanding while cutting costs, they're either too optimistic, delusional, or lying.We just saw an extended period with low interest and banks underperformed the S&P500 over that time. Other than my belief that interest rates won't remain st zero for nearly a decade, I don't think much else will be different. To me it would basically be buying a weak competitor in a weak sector.Good luck!",0,0.538,NEGATIVE,1.0

I expect that to return so not only with the price climb, I'll see extra revenue from dividends. They are cutting expenses. I got in when the price was around $28 a share. I think the stock could climb to prices pre-pandemic (40s/50s) and maybe even higher, this year or next. Their new CEO has proven good and brought necessary changes. But this could take a while.","I agree with you. I think it will be a good long term buy for many of the reasons you've stated. People don't have long memories, and WFC has stood the test of time. They still have a solid dividend and the price is relatively attractive right now.",0,0.539,POSITIVE,0.997
