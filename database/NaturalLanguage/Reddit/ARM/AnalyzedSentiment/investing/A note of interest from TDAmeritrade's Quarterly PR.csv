The premise of his article was that uninformed, first-time investors in the late 60s were buying the popular stocks of the day, but when the bear market of 1969-1970 came, they ended up experiencing a severe drawdown similar to the Great Depression - roughly an 80% loss of wealth. I dug around for information on what young investors are buying today (TD Ameritrade is actually pretty good at putting out research on stuff like this.), and came up with a list of 20 stocks that first-time investors were likely buying in 2016. Looking at maximum drawdowns over every rolling thee-year period over the last 20 years, it's theoretically possible that this basket of stocks (many of which are affectionately called meme stocks around here) could also decline about 80% in a bear market. Even the basket of stocks just reverting to their 52-week lows would cause a 30% decline in portfolio value. I would not be surprised if adding ""blockchain and cannabis-related securities"" to my research would make that number even worse.For reference, the S&P 500's worst drawdown over the last twenty year period was about 56.8%, and the 52-week low reversion was 18.5%.I tend to agree - may not be a top, but a lot of first-time investors are in for a rude awakening if even a moderate correction were to occur.",0,0.542,NEGATIVE,1.0

I mean, it's got 6 of the 10 biggest companies in the S&P 500, comprising nearly 15% of the index, as well as some generationally great performers like Netflix and NVIDIA. I think it's safe to say that if this basket is doing poorly, pretty much everyone is doing poorly.Meanwhile, how many ""sophisticated"" investors continue to sit out Netflix and Amazon because they are too stubborn to look beyond the P/E ratio? Sure, there are some big losers in that list. You don't need to be correct on every stock to be a good investor. In fact, you can be wrong on the majority of your stocks and still generate excellent returns. That's how the market itself works.",3,0.528,NEGATIVE,0.999
