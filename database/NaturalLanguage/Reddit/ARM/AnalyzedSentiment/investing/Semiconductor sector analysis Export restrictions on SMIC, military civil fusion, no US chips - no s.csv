,Do people think the US semiconductor industry is going to produce poor returns amidst the US-China tech decoupling? https://www.zenontech.co/post/volume-6-export-restrictions-on-smic-taiwan-independence-nvidia-arm-ip-roll-up,Every morning I honestly am puzzled as to why NVDA’s share price doesn’t get cut in halfIf anyone just looks at their income statement and balance sheet they’d see this company is massively less profitable than INTC and for that matter AMD. Meme strength definitely plays a roll hereI don’t think their valuation will ever look attractive,0,0.545,NEGATIVE,0.995

,Do people think the US semiconductor industry is going to produce poor returns amidst the US-China tech decoupling? https://www.zenontech.co/post/volume-6-export-restrictions-on-smic-taiwan-independence-nvidia-arm-ip-roll-up,"People said this when it crossed $100 too but it just kept delivering growth, in gaming but especially in datacenter plus promising moves in automotive. I think it's more a matter of INTC being possibly undervalued, NVDA's vision for datacenter that it has been executing on justifies the valuation.",1,0.543,NEGATIVE,0.747

The new products look extremely promising. When the market sees AMD largely matching both of its competitors (although in places it will be worse, in some even better) the share price will go up, making all the ratios expensive again before earnings even reflect the release.",1,0.588,NEGATIVE,1.0

NVDA's business does not warrant a 350B valuation let alone 200B. Their TOTAL REVENUE is 13B a year lol, not even profit or anything.",2,0.574,NEGATIVE,1.0

Nvidia IS the future Intel, as long as Jensen Huang doesn't perish in a bike accident or something.Does that justify the current valuation? Idk. But it's not for nothing that Nvidia is so feted right now.",3,0.531,NEGATIVE,0.646
