,"My grandpa taught me two principles for Long investing: a) invest in sectors that I know and b) invest in products you love. He was in the medical field and has made a killing in the biotech space over the years. And was early in lots of consumer companies that he used and loved - Netflix and Starbucks as an example. I’ve done really well following this advice (caveat being also been a mega bull market since I started investing in 2012). Personally, I’ve been in the tech space for 10 years and have primarily invested in it bc of that. Been a part of two companies that have had liquidation events - one of which has been a very successful IPO. And by being at these companies I was exposed to other great products which I became an investor in over the years. From the consumer side, I’ve been early in Amazon, Facebook, and lots of the big video game names. But it feels like my edge is pretty useless these days! Jig is up, everyone is just parking money in all of b2b tech. The company I work for ipo’d in 2017 and when I compare that IPO to the ones over the last year it’s pretty insane. Given where Tech in general is at (pretty absurd multiples for the most part) - I’ve taken a load of gains recently and want to diversify - but the problem is tech is what I know so it’s kind of going against my natural investing principles. I’m now thinking of putting cash in other verticals that have consumer products that I love, that have also pivoted in line with macro trends and/or have used the b2b technology I know well to differentiate themselves from their competition. Some examples: Disney: Strong pivot to streaming in a way that compliments its other revenue streams; big user of technology to do this cost-effectively and have each arm of the Occtoups feed the next (AWS, Hashicorp, Snowflake, Okta). Dominoes/Mcdonalds: Strong mobile and web presence. Embracing tech with their mobile apps, loyalty programs, and in store experiences while also a pivoting to partnering with delivery service market (Ubereats etc) and dabbling in the vegan market Home Depot: I’m useless with tools - I go there whenever I need stuff done and they’ve made some major pivots to delivery and improved their web experience greatly. JP Morgan Chase: I know this is small chips but I’ve seen how they have captured a generation of yuppie millennials with their Saphire program (great travel rewards, and this generation is doing a lot more traveling than white-picket fence home buying). Ally Financial: Iffy on this one given the state of the economy and Ally’s heavy exposure to the auto industry, but their mobile and digital experience and use of technology for automation of operations is truly impressive. I guess my questions for the community is: A) Do you have any other examples of traditional company’s that are using technology and pivoting to macro trends to thrive? B) How do you balance diversification with investing in what you know? Have you ever tried to “do a download on a new space”. How did you go about it? Edit: Grandma was not transgender","I follow the same philosophy of investing in what I use and love and it's been really successful, but I think you're missing the point by investing in large and well-known companies. You could just choose a large cap growth ETF like MGK and be on your way.Not that I think your choices are bad in anyway; I have big positions in Disney and MGK. But the kinds of gains you get from getting into a company early require the company to be relatively unknown and ideally expanding into new markets.I bought SQ at $20 because it was taking off in the bay area and I forgot my wallet all the time (and then did more research into its growth ops). I bought Etsy in April when I saw my friends using it during quarantine for graduation gifts (and then did more research into it) and now it's getting added to the S&P 500 today. I invested into DOCU around the same time because I had used the product earlier in the year and heard they were hiring aggressively in March at a time when others were firing.I don't think this is the kind of thing you can force. I think it's the kind of thing where, when you come across a product you really love, you look it up and see if you can invest into it.So, for example, my SO recently invested into ESTC around $70 and I've been DCA-ing into ETSY since 118 after getting stopped out after their recent earnings.How do you balance diversification with investing in what you know?I use stop losses on my stock picks. If I get stopped out and still believe, I just watch the stock until I think it finds a bottom and start DCA-ing into it again. This happened with ETSY after their recent earnings and I've been picking it up again since 118.",0,0.545,NEGATIVE,0.872

By knowing tech I mean I’m in the industry and I know what products are best and how well they’re doing compared to others well before you see it in top line results - and definitely before wall st. who don’t use the tech on the ground and see the trends competitively. There is no doubt that provides an edge on where to place your bets across B2B tech if you’re competing, partnering, and integrating with the other players in the space and through your network.Great example is new Relic. Everyone in the industry new they were getting killed way before their price halved because of architectural decisions and pricing mechanics changes. Everyone knew it was two players eating their lunch (stocks which have since some very well). Same with Symantec and Oracle and all their adjacent competitors.There is just no way I could know that about energy and telecom at this juncture.Maybe I can get there but hard for me to make big bets on who is differentiating themselves when I have no idea how these guys differentiate their products and services.And I guess just trying to figure out if it’s worth investing time to understand another space as intimately without living and breathing it the way I have with tech.Edit: typos",0,0.536,NEGATIVE,0.847

Given your profession you may have insight into the sector which will benefit you. But you'll also miss out on a more stable basis for your wealth, such as it is, since tech is hyper-competitive. Sector rotation is a real thing and if all you invest in is tech you will increase risk for yourself if a reason pops up for large funds to devalue the sector.
