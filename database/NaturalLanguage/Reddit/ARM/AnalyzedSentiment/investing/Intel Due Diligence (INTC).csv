But now I'm cautiously optimistic with Gelsinger at the helm. Gelsinger needs to (and I think he is) identify all the negatives (or current issues they face, including internal bureaucracy) and quickly address the vision on how to rectify these issues. At this point who cares if the stock price is affected... he didn't own the disfunction. Once he does that, and realigns the vision and internal systems to achieve the goal, he might have the most successful turn around story ever. I'm betting on him. I'll give him 5 years. If successful I'll be rewarded. If not, another fine US company lost to the great American corporate bureaucracy.",0,0.55,POSITIVE,0.982

Will probably buy them back if they take a dive but I see AMD as a short term investment with a high price.Intel right now has let 10 years of innovation smack it in the ass and is well behind AMD. AMD 7 years ago was trading at $3 a share and nearing bankruptcy, but Intel isn't anywhere near bankruptcy. With the chip shortage, truth is, if they can make anything the market can use, they will sell it and that high demand might paper over the cracks untill 2024.",2,0.578,NEGATIVE,0.924

While I think it’s possible to break that barrier, I’m personally under the impression that its not an engineering or manufacturing issue, but rather a Scientific issue that we haven’t fully understood and harnessed yet.

They still have plenty up their sleeve and in my opinion it isn't a question of if they can come back, but when.In addition to the reasons you listed, I'm also personally putting a lot of faith into alder lake to recapture the pc market. A lot of analysts and investors don't quite understand the whole nanometer naming convention and how it doesn't tell the whole picture at all. We constantly see this idea that amd is using the 7nm process and intel is so far behind they are still using 14nm and only now moving onto 10nm. The reality is that there is no industry standard to measure the transistor length (both are closer to 50nm in reality) and intel's 10nm process is roughly equivalent in density to tsmc's 7nm process. Intel will be at least on par with amd at least until amd gets a head start with their 5nm chips in late 2022. Early leaks suggest that alder lake should actually have the performance lead until then, which I expect to even improve along with windows 11 and their claim for optimization in their scheduler with big.little chips.The only downside I can see for the foreseeable future, which is admittedly a big one, is that datacenter growth is very uncertain. Even with their current disadvantage, we are still seeing some growth YoY.",0,0.544,POSITIVE,0.857
