,"Key Stats for NVIDIA Corporation Hard to believe, but am new to NVDA. So apologies for the layman's view! Ticker NVDA Sector Semiconductors Latest price $87.97 Value $47,064M Daily vol $1,337M Date 14 November 2016 Useful Links Latest news from Yahoo Finance Latest results from SEC Edgar Website: nvidia.com Description At their core they are just another semiconductor business. But as they say themselves: NVIDIA is the world leader in visual computing. And what does that mean? a specialized platform company that targets four large markets - Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive - where (Nvidia) brings together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, systems and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. i.e. Gaming companies create fantasy / virtual realities. Designers create visual effects for movies, or design new products. researchers can do simulations. Datacenters are able to increase performance and power efficiency. And the auto-industry is using their tech in autonomous cars. In terms of reporting their sales they have two divisions GPU (that's graphics processing units) which is their main business to 3 verticals: Gaming, Professional & Datacenters Tegra which ""integrates an entire computer onto a single chip"" and is sold to mobile business & the Automotive industry You won't be surprised given Gaming on PC is so established and autonomous cars are in their infancy that 75% of sales related to PC platforms. And... their largest client at 11% of sales is ASUSTeK Computer Inc. And the final thing to note about the business, is that NVDA is a fabless semi business. i.e. it doesn't have any factories itself, outsourcing production. It's really more on intellectual property business. And unsurprisingly 6.5k of the 9k employees are in the R&D division! Recent financials The last 5 years started off tough with sales only getting going in the last 3 years... Jan period end 2016A 2015A 2014A 2013A 2012A Revenue $5.0bn $4.7bn $4.1bn $4.3bn $4.0bn EPS $1.08 $1.12 $0.74 $0.90 $0.94 But the ""breakout"" really came this year with the forecast, for year ending Jan 2017, of $6.8bn in sales and an adjusted EPS of $2.41. Wow... that's nearly $2bn of extra sales... with a lot of it dropping to the bottom line. Though oddly, Wall Street's not expecting another ramp in the year ending Jan 2018 expecting $7.7bn of sales. Am wondering, if sales are accelerating now, what's to stop the business power on... was this year a one off? Competition Nvidia divides it's competition into Our current competitors include: suppliers of discrete and integrated GPUs, including supercomputers and chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel; suppliers of SOC products that are embedded into automobiles and smart devices such as televisions, monitors, set-top boxes, gaming devices and automobiles, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Apple, Inc., Avago Technologies Ltd., Intel, Marvell Technology Group Ltd., Mediatek, Mobileye N.V., Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung, ST Microelectronics, and Texas Instruments Incorporated; and licensors of graphics technologies, such as ARM Holdings plc, or ARM, and Imagination Technologies Group plc. So looking at margins and returns, they are clearly in the same zone as Intel, Qualcomm and Mobileye... though are far from best in class.

Dividends NVIDIA Corporation is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.48 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $0.35 per share. That is a 37% growth. The forecast dividend of $0.48 compares to a forecast EPS of $2.41. On top of dividends, the company's a fan of repurchasing stock. Just seems like they've not found any acquisition targets for their cash pile / cash machine. Either they are very disciplined, are the bees-knees at R&D and can build it all themselves... or management doesn't see a tangential business to expand into. Regardless, it's not a reason to complain. Keep the cash coming, boys! Catalysts In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 40% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 32%. On a 1 year view the stocks up 200% v earnings forecasts up 130%. Clearly there's some ""valuation"" inflation coming thro'. On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, the CEO / founder was asked to explain what was driving the growth. It's rather a lot of techno-babble but it's worth thinking thro' First of all, GPU computing...we've essentially taken very compute-intensive, very graphics-intensive applications, virtualizing it and putting it into the datacenter. the thing that really made it possible was really the transformation of our company from a graphics processor to a general purpose processor. And then, on top of that, probably the more important part of that, is transforming from a chip company to a platform company And with GPU acceleration, the benefit is incredible. It's not 20%, it's not 50%, it's 20 times, 50 times. So, Nvidia is making computing faster and more power efficient. It expands dramatically what you can do (gaming, autonomous cars, etc) and where you can do it (in smaller and smaller more mobile devices). It's easy to see why this technology is important. But I feel like I missed the boat. The contrarian in me is worried by the number of requests for this stock and commentary on r/investing. Napkin Math But to go the extra mile, let's reach for the cafe napkin, trust in Wall Street's forecasts and look out into the distant future.

In contrast, INTL and QCOM are trading below a market rating.

Ticker NVDA Sector Semiconductors Latest price $87.97 Value $47,064M Daily vol $1,337M Date 14 November 2016 Useful Links Latest news from Yahoo Finance Latest results from SEC Edgar Website: nvidia.com Description At their core they are just another semiconductor business. But as they say themselves: NVIDIA is the world leader in visual computing. And what does that mean? a specialized platform company that targets four large markets - Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive - where (Nvidia) brings together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, systems and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. i.e. Gaming companies create fantasy / virtual realities. Designers create visual effects for movies, or design new products. researchers can do simulations. Datacenters are able to increase performance and power efficiency. And the auto-industry is using their tech in autonomous cars. In terms of reporting their sales they have two divisions GPU (that's graphics processing units) which is their main business to 3 verticals: Gaming, Professional & Datacenters Tegra which ""integrates an entire computer onto a single chip"" and is sold to mobile business & the Automotive industry You won't be surprised given Gaming on PC is so established and autonomous cars are in their infancy that 75% of sales related to PC platforms. And... their largest client at 11% of sales is ASUSTeK Computer Inc. And the final thing to note about the business, is that NVDA is a fabless semi business. i.e. it doesn't have any factories itself, outsourcing production. It's really more on intellectual property business. And unsurprisingly 6.5k of the 9k employees are in the R&D division!

Wow... that's nearly $2bn of extra sales... with a lot of it dropping to the bottom line. Though oddly, Wall Street's not expecting another ramp in the year ending Jan 2018 expecting $7.7bn of sales. Am wondering, if sales are accelerating now, what's to stop the business power on... was this year a one off? Competition Nvidia divides it's competition into Our current competitors include: suppliers of discrete and integrated GPUs, including supercomputers and chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel; suppliers of SOC products that are embedded into automobiles and smart devices such as televisions, monitors, set-top boxes, gaming devices and automobiles, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Apple, Inc., Avago Technologies Ltd., Intel, Marvell Technology Group Ltd., Mediatek, Mobileye N.V., Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung, ST Microelectronics, and Texas Instruments Incorporated; and licensors of graphics technologies, such as ARM Holdings plc, or ARM, and Imagination Technologies Group plc.

It's not 20%, it's not 50%, it's 20 times, 50 times. So, Nvidia is making computing faster and more power efficient.

,"Key Stats for NVIDIA Corporation Hard to believe, but am new to NVDA. So apologies for the layman's view! Ticker NVDA Sector Semiconductors Latest price $87.97 Value $47,064M Daily vol $1,337M Date 14 November 2016 Useful Links Latest news from Yahoo Finance Latest results from SEC Edgar Website: nvidia.com Description At their core they are just another semiconductor business. But as they say themselves: NVIDIA is the world leader in visual computing. And what does that mean? a specialized platform company that targets four large markets - Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive - where (Nvidia) brings together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, systems and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. i.e. Gaming companies create fantasy / virtual realities. Designers create visual effects for movies, or design new products. researchers can do simulations. Datacenters are able to increase performance and power efficiency. And the auto-industry is using their tech in autonomous cars. In terms of reporting their sales they have two divisions GPU (that's graphics processing units) which is their main business to 3 verticals: Gaming, Professional & Datacenters Tegra which ""integrates an entire computer onto a single chip"" and is sold to mobile business & the Automotive industry You won't be surprised given Gaming on PC is so established and autonomous cars are in their infancy that 75% of sales related to PC platforms. And... their largest client at 11% of sales is ASUSTeK Computer Inc. And the final thing to note about the business, is that NVDA is a fabless semi business. i.e. it doesn't have any factories itself, outsourcing production. It's really more on intellectual property business. And unsurprisingly 6.5k of the 9k employees are in the R&D division!

Wow... that's nearly $2bn of extra sales... with a lot of it dropping to the bottom line. Though oddly, Wall Street's not expecting another ramp in the year ending Jan 2018 expecting $7.7bn of sales. Am wondering, if sales are accelerating now, what's to stop the business power on... was this year a one off? Competition Nvidia divides it's competition into Our current competitors include: suppliers of discrete and integrated GPUs, including supercomputers and chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel; suppliers of SOC products that are embedded into automobiles and smart devices such as televisions, monitors, set-top boxes, gaming devices and automobiles, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Apple, Inc., Avago Technologies Ltd., Intel, Marvell Technology Group Ltd., Mediatek, Mobileye N.V., Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung, ST Microelectronics, and Texas Instruments Incorporated; and licensors of graphics technologies, such as ARM Holdings plc, or ARM, and Imagination Technologies Group plc.

Dividends NVIDIA Corporation is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.48 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $0.35 per share. That is a 37% growth. The forecast dividend of $0.48 compares to a forecast EPS of $2.41. On top of dividends, the company's a fan of repurchasing stock. Just seems like they've not found any acquisition targets for their cash pile / cash machine.

On a 1 year view the stocks up 200% v earnings forecasts up 130%. Clearly there's some ""valuation"" inflation coming thro'. On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, the CEO / founder was asked to explain what was driving the growth. It's rather a lot of techno-babble but it's worth thinking thro' First of all, GPU computing...we've essentially taken very compute-intensive, very graphics-intensive applications, virtualizing it and putting it into the datacenter. the thing that really made it possible was really the transformation of our company from a graphics processor to a general purpose processor. And then, on top of that, probably the more important part of that, is transforming from a chip company to a platform company And with GPU acceleration, the benefit is incredible. It's not 20%, it's not 50%, it's 20 times, 50 times. So, Nvidia is making computing faster and more power efficient. It expands dramatically what you can do (gaming, autonomous cars, etc) and where you can do it (in smaller and smaller more mobile devices). It's easy to see why this technology is important. But I feel like I missed the boat. The contrarian in me is worried by the number of requests for this stock and commentary on r/investing. Napkin Math But to go the extra mile, let's reach for the cafe napkin, trust in Wall Street's forecasts and look out into the distant future.

,"Key Stats for NVIDIA Corporation Hard to believe, but am new to NVDA. So apologies for the layman's view! Ticker NVDA Sector Semiconductors Latest price $87.97 Value $47,064M Daily vol $1,337M Date 14 November 2016 Useful Links Latest news from Yahoo Finance Latest results from SEC Edgar Website: nvidia.com Description At their core they are just another semiconductor business. But as they say themselves: NVIDIA is the world leader in visual computing. And what does that mean? a specialized platform company that targets four large markets - Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive - where (Nvidia) brings together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, systems and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. i.e. Gaming companies create fantasy / virtual realities. Designers create visual effects for movies, or design new products. researchers can do simulations. Datacenters are able to increase performance and power efficiency. And the auto-industry is using their tech in autonomous cars. In terms of reporting their sales they have two divisions GPU (that's graphics processing units) which is their main business to 3 verticals: Gaming, Professional & Datacenters Tegra which ""integrates an entire computer onto a single chip"" and is sold to mobile business & the Automotive industry You won't be surprised given Gaming on PC is so established and autonomous cars are in their infancy that 75% of sales related to PC platforms. And... their largest client at 11% of sales is ASUSTeK Computer Inc. And the final thing to note about the business, is that NVDA is a fabless semi business. i.e. it doesn't have any factories itself, outsourcing production. It's really more on intellectual property business. And unsurprisingly 6.5k of the 9k employees are in the R&D division! Recent financials The last 5 years started off tough with sales only getting going in the last 3 years... Jan period end 2016A 2015A 2014A 2013A 2012A Revenue $5.0bn $4.7bn $4.1bn $4.3bn $4.0bn EPS $1.08 $1.12 $0.74 $0.90 $0.94 But the ""breakout"" really came this year with the forecast, for year ending Jan 2017, of $6.8bn in sales and an adjusted EPS of $2.41. Wow... that's nearly $2bn of extra sales... with a lot of it dropping to the bottom line. Though oddly, Wall Street's not expecting another ramp in the year ending Jan 2018 expecting $7.7bn of sales. Am wondering, if sales are accelerating now, what's to stop the business power on... was this year a one off? Competition Nvidia divides it's competition into Our current competitors include: suppliers of discrete and integrated GPUs, including supercomputers and chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel; suppliers of SOC products that are embedded into automobiles and smart devices such as televisions, monitors, set-top boxes, gaming devices and automobiles, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Apple, Inc., Avago Technologies Ltd., Intel, Marvell Technology Group Ltd., Mediatek, Mobileye N.V., Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung, ST Microelectronics, and Texas Instruments Incorporated; and licensors of graphics technologies, such as ARM Holdings plc, or ARM, and Imagination Technologies Group plc. So looking at margins and returns, they are clearly in the same zone as Intel, Qualcomm and Mobileye... though are far from best in class.

Dividends NVIDIA Corporation is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.48 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $0.35 per share. That is a 37% growth. The forecast dividend of $0.48 compares to a forecast EPS of $2.41. On top of dividends, the company's a fan of repurchasing stock. Just seems like they've not found any acquisition targets for their cash pile / cash machine. Either they are very disciplined, are the bees-knees at R&D and can build it all themselves... or management doesn't see a tangential business to expand into. Regardless, it's not a reason to complain. Keep the cash coming, boys! Catalysts In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 40% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 32%. On a 1 year view the stocks up 200% v earnings forecasts up 130%. Clearly there's some ""valuation"" inflation coming thro'. On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, the CEO / founder was asked to explain what was driving the growth. It's rather a lot of techno-babble but it's worth thinking thro' First of all, GPU computing...we've essentially taken very compute-intensive, very graphics-intensive applications, virtualizing it and putting it into the datacenter. the thing that really made it possible was really the transformation of our company from a graphics processor to a general purpose processor. And then, on top of that, probably the more important part of that, is transforming from a chip company to a platform company And with GPU acceleration, the benefit is incredible. It's not 20%, it's not 50%, it's 20 times, 50 times. So, Nvidia is making computing faster and more power efficient. It expands dramatically what you can do (gaming, autonomous cars, etc) and where you can do it (in smaller and smaller more mobile devices). It's easy to see why this technology is important. But I feel like I missed the boat. The contrarian in me is worried by the number of requests for this stock and commentary on r/investing. Napkin Math But to go the extra mile, let's reach for the cafe napkin, trust in Wall Street's forecasts and look out into the distant future.

In contrast, INTL and QCOM are trading below a market rating.

If you love Nintendo then it's great, but if you don't then it's troubling. I'm betting on both of them. The starting price for the basic Switch unit is 250-260. Someone is giving up margin to get the ball really rolling, and we won't know for a bit. Nvidia has put so much time into the Shield, I think they were looking for a way to turn it into something big. It's to bad we can't get a real close look at the agreement with Nintendo.",4,0.541,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Key Stats for NVIDIA Corporation Hard to believe, but am new to NVDA. So apologies for the layman's view! Ticker NVDA Sector Semiconductors Latest price $87.97 Value $47,064M Daily vol $1,337M Date 14 November 2016 Useful Links Latest news from Yahoo Finance Latest results from SEC Edgar Website: nvidia.com Description At their core they are just another semiconductor business. But as they say themselves: NVIDIA is the world leader in visual computing. And what does that mean? a specialized platform company that targets four large markets - Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive - where (Nvidia) brings together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, systems and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. i.e. Gaming companies create fantasy / virtual realities. Designers create visual effects for movies, or design new products. researchers can do simulations. Datacenters are able to increase performance and power efficiency. And the auto-industry is using their tech in autonomous cars. In terms of reporting their sales they have two divisions GPU (that's graphics processing units) which is their main business to 3 verticals: Gaming, Professional & Datacenters Tegra which ""integrates an entire computer onto a single chip"" and is sold to mobile business & the Automotive industry You won't be surprised given Gaming on PC is so established and autonomous cars are in their infancy that 75% of sales related to PC platforms. And... their largest client at 11% of sales is ASUSTeK Computer Inc. And the final thing to note about the business, is that NVDA is a fabless semi business. i.e. it doesn't have any factories itself, outsourcing production. It's really more on intellectual property business. And unsurprisingly 6.5k of the 9k employees are in the R&D division!

Wow... that's nearly $2bn of extra sales... with a lot of it dropping to the bottom line. Though oddly, Wall Street's not expecting another ramp in the year ending Jan 2018 expecting $7.7bn of sales. Am wondering, if sales are accelerating now, what's to stop the business power on... was this year a one off? Competition Nvidia divides it's competition into Our current competitors include: suppliers of discrete and integrated GPUs, including supercomputers and chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel; suppliers of SOC products that are embedded into automobiles and smart devices such as televisions, monitors, set-top boxes, gaming devices and automobiles, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Apple, Inc., Avago Technologies Ltd., Intel, Marvell Technology Group Ltd., Mediatek, Mobileye N.V., Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung, ST Microelectronics, and Texas Instruments Incorporated; and licensors of graphics technologies, such as ARM Holdings plc, or ARM, and Imagination Technologies Group plc.

Any takers?You would be a lunatic to invest in VMware as a virtualization play. They're blackberry in 2007. They have no future compared to public cloud. (I am a devops engineer and work with vms all day every day).I bought NVDA at 30. I've been slowly selling it as it takes up more and more of my portfolio (it was 90% at one point).The reason I bought it was that I wanted to invest in AI and machine learning and it was the closest thing to a pure play I could find. Google and Facebook were too diverse. That it's also a VR, self driving car, video game and a cryptocurrency play was just icing on the cake.I think that it has a lot of room on the upside and I think people are underestimating the future value of machine learning by a lot.",0,0.518,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Key Stats for NVIDIA Corporation Hard to believe, but am new to NVDA. So apologies for the layman's view! Ticker NVDA Sector Semiconductors Latest price $87.97 Value $47,064M Daily vol $1,337M Date 14 November 2016 Useful Links Latest news from Yahoo Finance Latest results from SEC Edgar Website: nvidia.com Description At their core they are just another semiconductor business. But as they say themselves: NVIDIA is the world leader in visual computing. And what does that mean? a specialized platform company that targets four large markets - Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive - where (Nvidia) brings together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, systems and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. i.e. Gaming companies create fantasy / virtual realities. Designers create visual effects for movies, or design new products. researchers can do simulations. Datacenters are able to increase performance and power efficiency. And the auto-industry is using their tech in autonomous cars. In terms of reporting their sales they have two divisions GPU (that's graphics processing units) which is their main business to 3 verticals: Gaming, Professional & Datacenters Tegra which ""integrates an entire computer onto a single chip"" and is sold to mobile business & the Automotive industry You won't be surprised given Gaming on PC is so established and autonomous cars are in their infancy that 75% of sales related to PC platforms. And... their largest client at 11% of sales is ASUSTeK Computer Inc. And the final thing to note about the business, is that NVDA is a fabless semi business. i.e. it doesn't have any factories itself, outsourcing production. It's really more on intellectual property business. And unsurprisingly 6.5k of the 9k employees are in the R&D division!

Wow... that's nearly $2bn of extra sales... with a lot of it dropping to the bottom line. Though oddly, Wall Street's not expecting another ramp in the year ending Jan 2018 expecting $7.7bn of sales. Am wondering, if sales are accelerating now, what's to stop the business power on... was this year a one off? Competition Nvidia divides it's competition into Our current competitors include: suppliers of discrete and integrated GPUs, including supercomputers and chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel; suppliers of SOC products that are embedded into automobiles and smart devices such as televisions, monitors, set-top boxes, gaming devices and automobiles, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Apple, Inc., Avago Technologies Ltd., Intel, Marvell Technology Group Ltd., Mediatek, Mobileye N.V., Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung, ST Microelectronics, and Texas Instruments Incorporated; and licensors of graphics technologies, such as ARM Holdings plc, or ARM, and Imagination Technologies Group plc.

It's not 20%, it's not 50%, it's 20 times, 50 times. So, Nvidia is making computing faster and more power efficient. It expands dramatically what you can do (gaming, autonomous cars, etc) and where you can do it (in smaller and smaller more mobile devices). It's easy to see why this technology is important.

But as they say themselves: NVIDIA is the world leader in visual computing. And what does that mean? a specialized platform company that targets four large markets - Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive - where (Nvidia) brings together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, systems and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. i.e. Gaming companies create fantasy / virtual realities. Designers create visual effects for movies, or design new products. researchers can do simulations. Datacenters are able to increase performance and power efficiency. And the auto-industry is using their tech in autonomous cars. In terms of reporting their sales they have two divisions GPU (that's graphics processing units) which is their main business to 3 verticals: Gaming, Professional & Datacenters Tegra which ""integrates an entire computer onto a single chip"" and is sold to mobile business & the Automotive industry You won't be surprised given Gaming on PC is so established and autonomous cars are in their infancy that 75% of sales related to PC platforms. And... their largest client at 11% of sales is ASUSTeK Computer Inc. And the final thing to note about the business, is that NVDA is a fabless semi business. i.e. it doesn't have any factories itself, outsourcing production.

Wow... that's nearly $2bn of extra sales... with a lot of it dropping to the bottom line. Though oddly, Wall Street's not expecting another ramp in the year ending Jan 2018 expecting $7.7bn of sales. Am wondering, if sales are accelerating now, what's to stop the business power on... was this year a one off? Competition Nvidia divides it's competition into Our current competitors include: suppliers of discrete and integrated GPUs, including supercomputers and chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel; suppliers of SOC products that are embedded into automobiles and smart devices such as televisions, monitors, set-top boxes, gaming devices and automobiles, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Apple, Inc., Avago Technologies Ltd., Intel, Marvell Technology Group Ltd., Mediatek, Mobileye N.V., Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung, ST Microelectronics, and Texas Instruments Incorporated; and licensors of graphics technologies, such as ARM Holdings plc, or ARM, and Imagination Technologies Group plc.

,"Key Stats for NVIDIA Corporation Hard to believe, but am new to NVDA. So apologies for the layman's view! Ticker NVDA Sector Semiconductors Latest price $87.97 Value $47,064M Daily vol $1,337M Date 14 November 2016 Useful Links Latest news from Yahoo Finance Latest results from SEC Edgar Website: nvidia.com Description At their core they are just another semiconductor business. But as they say themselves: NVIDIA is the world leader in visual computing. And what does that mean? a specialized platform company that targets four large markets - Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive - where (Nvidia) brings together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, systems and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. i.e. Gaming companies create fantasy / virtual realities. Designers create visual effects for movies, or design new products. researchers can do simulations. Datacenters are able to increase performance and power efficiency. And the auto-industry is using their tech in autonomous cars. In terms of reporting their sales they have two divisions GPU (that's graphics processing units) which is their main business to 3 verticals: Gaming, Professional & Datacenters Tegra which ""integrates an entire computer onto a single chip"" and is sold to mobile business & the Automotive industry You won't be surprised given Gaming on PC is so established and autonomous cars are in their infancy that 75% of sales related to PC platforms. And... their largest client at 11% of sales is ASUSTeK Computer Inc. And the final thing to note about the business, is that NVDA is a fabless semi business. i.e. it doesn't have any factories itself, outsourcing production. It's really more on intellectual property business. And unsurprisingly 6.5k of the 9k employees are in the R&D division!

Wow... that's nearly $2bn of extra sales... with a lot of it dropping to the bottom line. Though oddly, Wall Street's not expecting another ramp in the year ending Jan 2018 expecting $7.7bn of sales. Am wondering, if sales are accelerating now, what's to stop the business power on... was this year a one off? Competition Nvidia divides it's competition into Our current competitors include: suppliers of discrete and integrated GPUs, including supercomputers and chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel; suppliers of SOC products that are embedded into automobiles and smart devices such as televisions, monitors, set-top boxes, gaming devices and automobiles, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Apple, Inc., Avago Technologies Ltd., Intel, Marvell Technology Group Ltd., Mediatek, Mobileye N.V., Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung, ST Microelectronics, and Texas Instruments Incorporated; and licensors of graphics technologies, such as ARM Holdings plc, or ARM, and Imagination Technologies Group plc.

,"Key Stats for NVIDIA Corporation Hard to believe, but am new to NVDA. So apologies for the layman's view! Ticker NVDA Sector Semiconductors Latest price $87.97 Value $47,064M Daily vol $1,337M Date 14 November 2016 Useful Links Latest news from Yahoo Finance Latest results from SEC Edgar Website: nvidia.com Description At their core they are just another semiconductor business. But as they say themselves: NVIDIA is the world leader in visual computing. And what does that mean? a specialized platform company that targets four large markets - Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive - where (Nvidia) brings together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, systems and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. i.e. Gaming companies create fantasy / virtual realities. Designers create visual effects for movies, or design new products. researchers can do simulations. Datacenters are able to increase performance and power efficiency. And the auto-industry is using their tech in autonomous cars. In terms of reporting their sales they have two divisions GPU (that's graphics processing units) which is their main business to 3 verticals: Gaming, Professional & Datacenters Tegra which ""integrates an entire computer onto a single chip"" and is sold to mobile business & the Automotive industry You won't be surprised given Gaming on PC is so established and autonomous cars are in their infancy that 75% of sales related to PC platforms. And... their largest client at 11% of sales is ASUSTeK Computer Inc. And the final thing to note about the business, is that NVDA is a fabless semi business. i.e. it doesn't have any factories itself, outsourcing production. It's really more on intellectual property business. And unsurprisingly 6.5k of the 9k employees are in the R&D division!

Wow... that's nearly $2bn of extra sales... with a lot of it dropping to the bottom line. Though oddly, Wall Street's not expecting another ramp in the year ending Jan 2018 expecting $7.7bn of sales. Am wondering, if sales are accelerating now, what's to stop the business power on... was this year a one off? Competition Nvidia divides it's competition into Our current competitors include: suppliers of discrete and integrated GPUs, including supercomputers and chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel; suppliers of SOC products that are embedded into automobiles and smart devices such as televisions, monitors, set-top boxes, gaming devices and automobiles, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Apple, Inc., Avago Technologies Ltd., Intel, Marvell Technology Group Ltd., Mediatek, Mobileye N.V., Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung, ST Microelectronics, and Texas Instruments Incorporated; and licensors of graphics technologies, such as ARM Holdings plc, or ARM, and Imagination Technologies Group plc.

It's not 20%, it's not 50%, it's 20 times, 50 times. So, Nvidia is making computing faster and more power efficient.

,"Key Stats for NVIDIA Corporation Hard to believe, but am new to NVDA. So apologies for the layman's view! Ticker NVDA Sector Semiconductors Latest price $87.97 Value $47,064M Daily vol $1,337M Date 14 November 2016 Useful Links Latest news from Yahoo Finance Latest results from SEC Edgar Website: nvidia.com Description At their core they are just another semiconductor business. But as they say themselves: NVIDIA is the world leader in visual computing. And what does that mean? a specialized platform company that targets four large markets - Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive - where (Nvidia) brings together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, systems and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. i.e. Gaming companies create fantasy / virtual realities. Designers create visual effects for movies, or design new products. researchers can do simulations. Datacenters are able to increase performance and power efficiency. And the auto-industry is using their tech in autonomous cars. In terms of reporting their sales they have two divisions GPU (that's graphics processing units) which is their main business to 3 verticals: Gaming, Professional & Datacenters Tegra which ""integrates an entire computer onto a single chip"" and is sold to mobile business & the Automotive industry You won't be surprised given Gaming on PC is so established and autonomous cars are in their infancy that 75% of sales related to PC platforms. And... their largest client at 11% of sales is ASUSTeK Computer Inc. And the final thing to note about the business, is that NVDA is a fabless semi business. i.e. it doesn't have any factories itself, outsourcing production. It's really more on intellectual property business. And unsurprisingly 6.5k of the 9k employees are in the R&D division!

Wow... that's nearly $2bn of extra sales... with a lot of it dropping to the bottom line. Though oddly, Wall Street's not expecting another ramp in the year ending Jan 2018 expecting $7.7bn of sales. Am wondering, if sales are accelerating now, what's to stop the business power on... was this year a one off? Competition Nvidia divides it's competition into Our current competitors include: suppliers of discrete and integrated GPUs, including supercomputers and chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel; suppliers of SOC products that are embedded into automobiles and smart devices such as televisions, monitors, set-top boxes, gaming devices and automobiles, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Apple, Inc., Avago Technologies Ltd., Intel, Marvell Technology Group Ltd., Mediatek, Mobileye N.V., Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung, ST Microelectronics, and Texas Instruments Incorporated; and licensors of graphics technologies, such as ARM Holdings plc, or ARM, and Imagination Technologies Group plc.

And then, on top of that, probably the more important part of that, is transforming from a chip company to a platform company And with GPU acceleration, the benefit is incredible. It's not 20%, it's not 50%, it's 20 times, 50 times. So, Nvidia is making computing faster and more power efficient. It expands dramatically what you can do (gaming, autonomous cars, etc) and where you can do it (in smaller and smaller more mobile devices). It's easy to see why this technology is important.

And what does that mean? a specialized platform company that targets four large markets - Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive - where (Nvidia) brings together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, systems and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. i.e. Gaming companies create fantasy / virtual realities. Designers create visual effects for movies, or design new products. researchers can do simulations. Datacenters are able to increase performance and power efficiency. And the auto-industry is using their tech in autonomous cars. In terms of reporting their sales they have two divisions GPU (that's graphics processing units) which is their main business to 3 verticals: Gaming, Professional & Datacenters Tegra which ""integrates an entire computer onto a single chip"" and is sold to mobile business & the Automotive industry You won't be surprised given Gaming on PC is so established and autonomous cars are in their infancy that 75% of sales related to PC platforms. And... their largest client at 11% of sales is ASUSTeK Computer Inc. And the final thing to note about the business, is that NVDA is a fabless semi business. i.e. it doesn't have any factories itself, outsourcing production.

,"Key Stats for NVIDIA Corporation Hard to believe, but am new to NVDA. So apologies for the layman's view! Ticker NVDA Sector Semiconductors Latest price $87.97 Value $47,064M Daily vol $1,337M Date 14 November 2016 Useful Links Latest news from Yahoo Finance Latest results from SEC Edgar Website: nvidia.com Description At their core they are just another semiconductor business. But as they say themselves: NVIDIA is the world leader in visual computing. And what does that mean? a specialized platform company that targets four large markets - Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive - where (Nvidia) brings together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, systems and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. i.e. Gaming companies create fantasy / virtual realities. Designers create visual effects for movies, or design new products. researchers can do simulations. Datacenters are able to increase performance and power efficiency. And the auto-industry is using their tech in autonomous cars. In terms of reporting their sales they have two divisions GPU (that's graphics processing units) which is their main business to 3 verticals: Gaming, Professional & Datacenters Tegra which ""integrates an entire computer onto a single chip"" and is sold to mobile business & the Automotive industry You won't be surprised given Gaming on PC is so established and autonomous cars are in their infancy that 75% of sales related to PC platforms. And... their largest client at 11% of sales is ASUSTeK Computer Inc. And the final thing to note about the business, is that NVDA is a fabless semi business. i.e. it doesn't have any factories itself, outsourcing production. It's really more on intellectual property business. And unsurprisingly 6.5k of the 9k employees are in the R&D division!

Wow... that's nearly $2bn of extra sales... with a lot of it dropping to the bottom line. Though oddly, Wall Street's not expecting another ramp in the year ending Jan 2018 expecting $7.7bn of sales. Am wondering, if sales are accelerating now, what's to stop the business power on... was this year a one off? Competition Nvidia divides it's competition into Our current competitors include: suppliers of discrete and integrated GPUs, including supercomputers and chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel; suppliers of SOC products that are embedded into automobiles and smart devices such as televisions, monitors, set-top boxes, gaming devices and automobiles, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Apple, Inc., Avago Technologies Ltd., Intel, Marvell Technology Group Ltd., Mediatek, Mobileye N.V., Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung, ST Microelectronics, and Texas Instruments Incorporated; and licensors of graphics technologies, such as ARM Holdings plc, or ARM, and Imagination Technologies Group plc.

It's not 20%, it's not 50%, it's 20 times, 50 times. So, Nvidia is making computing faster and more power efficient.

,"Key Stats for NVIDIA Corporation Hard to believe, but am new to NVDA. So apologies for the layman's view! Ticker NVDA Sector Semiconductors Latest price $87.97 Value $47,064M Daily vol $1,337M Date 14 November 2016 Useful Links Latest news from Yahoo Finance Latest results from SEC Edgar Website: nvidia.com Description At their core they are just another semiconductor business. But as they say themselves: NVIDIA is the world leader in visual computing. And what does that mean? a specialized platform company that targets four large markets - Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive - where (Nvidia) brings together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, systems and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. i.e. Gaming companies create fantasy / virtual realities. Designers create visual effects for movies, or design new products. researchers can do simulations. Datacenters are able to increase performance and power efficiency. And the auto-industry is using their tech in autonomous cars. In terms of reporting their sales they have two divisions GPU (that's graphics processing units) which is their main business to 3 verticals: Gaming, Professional & Datacenters Tegra which ""integrates an entire computer onto a single chip"" and is sold to mobile business & the Automotive industry You won't be surprised given Gaming on PC is so established and autonomous cars are in their infancy that 75% of sales related to PC platforms. And... their largest client at 11% of sales is ASUSTeK Computer Inc. And the final thing to note about the business, is that NVDA is a fabless semi business. i.e. it doesn't have any factories itself, outsourcing production. It's really more on intellectual property business. And unsurprisingly 6.5k of the 9k employees are in the R&D division!

Wow... that's nearly $2bn of extra sales... with a lot of it dropping to the bottom line. Though oddly, Wall Street's not expecting another ramp in the year ending Jan 2018 expecting $7.7bn of sales. Am wondering, if sales are accelerating now, what's to stop the business power on... was this year a one off? Competition Nvidia divides it's competition into Our current competitors include: suppliers of discrete and integrated GPUs, including supercomputers and chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel; suppliers of SOC products that are embedded into automobiles and smart devices such as televisions, monitors, set-top boxes, gaming devices and automobiles, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Apple, Inc., Avago Technologies Ltd., Intel, Marvell Technology Group Ltd., Mediatek, Mobileye N.V., Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung, ST Microelectronics, and Texas Instruments Incorporated; and licensors of graphics technologies, such as ARM Holdings plc, or ARM, and Imagination Technologies Group plc.

You then turn around and sell it and hope the stock price falls. You are on the hook for returning the shares to the actual owner at some point. If the stock price falls, you re-buy the shares at a cheaper price than what you sold them at, return the shares to the owner, and you pocket the cash (difference between what you originally sold at and finally bought at).",4,0.555,NEGATIVE,0.986
,"Key Stats for NVIDIA Corporation Hard to believe, but am new to NVDA. So apologies for the layman's view!

But as they say themselves: NVIDIA is the world leader in visual computing. And what does that mean? a specialized platform company that targets four large markets - Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive - where (Nvidia) brings together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, systems and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. i.e. Gaming companies create fantasy / virtual realities. Designers create visual effects for movies, or design new products. researchers can do simulations. Datacenters are able to increase performance and power efficiency. And the auto-industry is using their tech in autonomous cars. In terms of reporting their sales they have two divisions GPU (that's graphics processing units) which is their main business to 3 verticals: Gaming, Professional & Datacenters Tegra which ""integrates an entire computer onto a single chip"" and is sold to mobile business & the Automotive industry You won't be surprised given Gaming on PC is so established and autonomous cars are in their infancy that 75% of sales related to PC platforms. And... their largest client at 11% of sales is ASUSTeK Computer Inc. And the final thing to note about the business, is that NVDA is a fabless semi business. i.e. it doesn't have any factories itself, outsourcing production.

Regardless, it's not a reason to complain. Keep the cash coming, boys! Catalysts In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 40% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 32%. On a 1 year view the stocks up 200% v earnings forecasts up 130%. Clearly there's some ""valuation"" inflation coming thro'. On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, the CEO / founder was asked to explain what was driving the growth. It's rather a lot of techno-babble but it's worth thinking thro' First of all, GPU computing...we've essentially taken very compute-intensive, very graphics-intensive applications, virtualizing it and putting it into the datacenter. the thing that really made it possible was really the transformation of our company from a graphics processor to a general purpose processor. And then, on top of that, probably the more important part of that, is transforming from a chip company to a platform company And with GPU acceleration, the benefit is incredible. It's not 20%, it's not 50%, it's 20 times, 50 times. So, Nvidia is making computing faster and more power efficient. It expands dramatically what you can do (gaming, autonomous cars, etc) and where you can do it (in smaller and smaller more mobile devices). It's easy to see why this technology is important. But I feel like I missed the boat. The contrarian in me is worried by the number of requests for this stock and commentary on r/investing. Napkin Math But to go the extra mile, let's reach for the cafe napkin, trust in Wall Street's forecasts and look out into the distant future. Sure valuations of high fliers like NVDA come back to earth, but the growth is so strong, why'd you care. Companies PE ratio Growth Divie NVIDIA 37x 25% 1% Intel 13x 10% 3% Qualcomm 14x 11% 3% If NVDA going to see it's valuation return to a market rating in the long-term, then the 25% earnings from will turn into high-teens gains, as the PE compresses. In contrast, INTL and QCOM are trading below a market rating. But a re-rating aside, if they eek out low double digit growth in earnings and keep a high divie, their long-term gains is almost the same. Companies Gain = Change in Valuation + Growth + yield NVIDIA 18% = -8% + 25% + 1% Intel 16% = 3% + 10% + 3% Qualcomm 16% = 2% + 11% + 3% So, I can take the hot stock and hold it for 10 years or the old men and get to the same place.

An assumption that's proved unreliable in the past. ;) Perhaps I should consider a tangential bet? e.g. Citrix or VMware if the virtualization story is key. Any takers?

,"Key Stats for NVIDIA Corporation Hard to believe, but am new to NVDA. So apologies for the layman's view! Ticker NVDA Sector Semiconductors Latest price $87.97 Value $47,064M Daily vol $1,337M Date 14 November 2016 Useful Links Latest news from Yahoo Finance Latest results from SEC Edgar Website: nvidia.com Description At their core they are just another semiconductor business. But as they say themselves: NVIDIA is the world leader in visual computing. And what does that mean? a specialized platform company that targets four large markets - Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive - where (Nvidia) brings together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, systems and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. i.e. Gaming companies create fantasy / virtual realities. Designers create visual effects for movies, or design new products. researchers can do simulations. Datacenters are able to increase performance and power efficiency. And the auto-industry is using their tech in autonomous cars. In terms of reporting their sales they have two divisions GPU (that's graphics processing units) which is their main business to 3 verticals: Gaming, Professional & Datacenters Tegra which ""integrates an entire computer onto a single chip"" and is sold to mobile business & the Automotive industry You won't be surprised given Gaming on PC is so established and autonomous cars are in their infancy that 75% of sales related to PC platforms. And... their largest client at 11% of sales is ASUSTeK Computer Inc. And the final thing to note about the business, is that NVDA is a fabless semi business. i.e. it doesn't have any factories itself, outsourcing production. It's really more on intellectual property business. And unsurprisingly 6.5k of the 9k employees are in the R&D division!

Wow... that's nearly $2bn of extra sales... with a lot of it dropping to the bottom line. Though oddly, Wall Street's not expecting another ramp in the year ending Jan 2018 expecting $7.7bn of sales. Am wondering, if sales are accelerating now, what's to stop the business power on... was this year a one off? Competition Nvidia divides it's competition into Our current competitors include: suppliers of discrete and integrated GPUs, including supercomputers and chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel; suppliers of SOC products that are embedded into automobiles and smart devices such as televisions, monitors, set-top boxes, gaming devices and automobiles, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Apple, Inc., Avago Technologies Ltd., Intel, Marvell Technology Group Ltd., Mediatek, Mobileye N.V., Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung, ST Microelectronics, and Texas Instruments Incorporated; and licensors of graphics technologies, such as ARM Holdings plc, or ARM, and Imagination Technologies Group plc.

Ticker NVDA Sector Semiconductors Latest price $87.97 Value $47,064M Daily vol $1,337M Date 14 November 2016 Useful Links Latest news from Yahoo Finance Latest results from SEC Edgar Website: nvidia.com Description At their core they are just another semiconductor business. But as they say themselves: NVIDIA is the world leader in visual computing. And what does that mean? a specialized platform company that targets four large markets - Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive - where (Nvidia) brings together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, systems and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. i.e. Gaming companies create fantasy / virtual realities. Designers create visual effects for movies, or design new products. researchers can do simulations. Datacenters are able to increase performance and power efficiency. And the auto-industry is using their tech in autonomous cars. In terms of reporting their sales they have two divisions GPU (that's graphics processing units) which is their main business to 3 verticals: Gaming, Professional & Datacenters Tegra which ""integrates an entire computer onto a single chip"" and is sold to mobile business & the Automotive industry You won't be surprised given Gaming on PC is so established and autonomous cars are in their infancy that 75% of sales related to PC platforms. And... their largest client at 11% of sales is ASUSTeK Computer Inc. And the final thing to note about the business, is that NVDA is a fabless semi business. i.e. it doesn't have any factories itself, outsourcing production.

Wow... that's nearly $2bn of extra sales... with a lot of it dropping to the bottom line. Though oddly, Wall Street's not expecting another ramp in the year ending Jan 2018 expecting $7.7bn of sales. Am wondering, if sales are accelerating now, what's to stop the business power on... was this year a one off?

It's rather a lot of techno-babble but it's worth thinking thro' First of all, GPU computing...we've essentially taken very compute-intensive, very graphics-intensive applications, virtualizing it and putting it into the datacenter. the thing that really made it possible was really the transformation of our company from a graphics processor to a general purpose processor.

It's not 20%, it's not 50%, it's 20 times, 50 times. So, Nvidia is making computing faster and more power efficient. It expands dramatically what you can do (gaming, autonomous cars, etc) and where you can do it (in smaller and smaller more mobile devices). It's easy to see why this technology is important. But I feel like I missed the boat. The contrarian in me is worried by the number of requests for this stock and commentary on r/investing.

In contrast, INTL and QCOM are trading below a market rating.

,"Key Stats for NVIDIA Corporation Hard to believe, but am new to NVDA. So apologies for the layman's view! Ticker NVDA Sector Semiconductors Latest price $87.97 Value $47,064M Daily vol $1,337M Date 14 November 2016 Useful Links Latest news from Yahoo Finance Latest results from SEC Edgar Website: nvidia.com Description At their core they are just another semiconductor business. But as they say themselves: NVIDIA is the world leader in visual computing. And what does that mean? a specialized platform company that targets four large markets - Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive - where (Nvidia) brings together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, systems and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. i.e. Gaming companies create fantasy / virtual realities. Designers create visual effects for movies, or design new products. researchers can do simulations. Datacenters are able to increase performance and power efficiency. And the auto-industry is using their tech in autonomous cars. In terms of reporting their sales they have two divisions GPU (that's graphics processing units) which is their main business to 3 verticals: Gaming, Professional & Datacenters Tegra which ""integrates an entire computer onto a single chip"" and is sold to mobile business & the Automotive industry You won't be surprised given Gaming on PC is so established and autonomous cars are in their infancy that 75% of sales related to PC platforms. And... their largest client at 11% of sales is ASUSTeK Computer Inc. And the final thing to note about the business, is that NVDA is a fabless semi business. i.e. it doesn't have any factories itself, outsourcing production. It's really more on intellectual property business. And unsurprisingly 6.5k of the 9k employees are in the R&D division!

Wow... that's nearly $2bn of extra sales... with a lot of it dropping to the bottom line. Though oddly, Wall Street's not expecting another ramp in the year ending Jan 2018 expecting $7.7bn of sales. Am wondering, if sales are accelerating now, what's to stop the business power on... was this year a one off? Competition Nvidia divides it's competition into Our current competitors include: suppliers of discrete and integrated GPUs, including supercomputers and chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel; suppliers of SOC products that are embedded into automobiles and smart devices such as televisions, monitors, set-top boxes, gaming devices and automobiles, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Apple, Inc., Avago Technologies Ltd., Intel, Marvell Technology Group Ltd., Mediatek, Mobileye N.V., Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung, ST Microelectronics, and Texas Instruments Incorporated; and licensors of graphics technologies, such as ARM Holdings plc, or ARM, and Imagination Technologies Group plc.

,"Key Stats for NVIDIA Corporation Hard to believe, but am new to NVDA. So apologies for the layman's view! Ticker NVDA Sector Semiconductors Latest price $87.97 Value $47,064M Daily vol $1,337M Date 14 November 2016 Useful Links Latest news from Yahoo Finance Latest results from SEC Edgar Website: nvidia.com Description At their core they are just another semiconductor business. But as they say themselves: NVIDIA is the world leader in visual computing. And what does that mean? a specialized platform company that targets four large markets - Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive - where (Nvidia) brings together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, systems and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. i.e. Gaming companies create fantasy / virtual realities. Designers create visual effects for movies, or design new products. researchers can do simulations. Datacenters are able to increase performance and power efficiency. And the auto-industry is using their tech in autonomous cars. In terms of reporting their sales they have two divisions GPU (that's graphics processing units) which is their main business to 3 verticals: Gaming, Professional & Datacenters Tegra which ""integrates an entire computer onto a single chip"" and is sold to mobile business & the Automotive industry You won't be surprised given Gaming on PC is so established and autonomous cars are in their infancy that 75% of sales related to PC platforms. And... their largest client at 11% of sales is ASUSTeK Computer Inc. And the final thing to note about the business, is that NVDA is a fabless semi business. i.e. it doesn't have any factories itself, outsourcing production. It's really more on intellectual property business. And unsurprisingly 6.5k of the 9k employees are in the R&D division! Recent financials The last 5 years started off tough with sales only getting going in the last 3 years... Jan period end 2016A 2015A 2014A 2013A 2012A Revenue $5.0bn $4.7bn $4.1bn $4.3bn $4.0bn EPS $1.08 $1.12 $0.74 $0.90 $0.94 But the ""breakout"" really came this year with the forecast, for year ending Jan 2017, of $6.8bn in sales and an adjusted EPS of $2.41. Wow... that's nearly $2bn of extra sales... with a lot of it dropping to the bottom line. Though oddly, Wall Street's not expecting another ramp in the year ending Jan 2018 expecting $7.7bn of sales. Am wondering, if sales are accelerating now, what's to stop the business power on... was this year a one off? Competition Nvidia divides it's competition into Our current competitors include: suppliers of discrete and integrated GPUs, including supercomputers and chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel; suppliers of SOC products that are embedded into automobiles and smart devices such as televisions, monitors, set-top boxes, gaming devices and automobiles, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Apple, Inc., Avago Technologies Ltd., Intel, Marvell Technology Group Ltd., Mediatek, Mobileye N.V., Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung, ST Microelectronics, and Texas Instruments Incorporated; and licensors of graphics technologies, such as ARM Holdings plc, or ARM, and Imagination Technologies Group plc. So looking at margins and returns, they are clearly in the same zone as Intel, Qualcomm and Mobileye... though are far from best in class. Perhaps that indicates there's room for further margin expansion?

NVIDIA has $3,626M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 8% of the market value. Far from atypical in Tech to run cash positions, so nothing to worry about here. Wall Street thinks? The professionals on Wall Street have a $83.60 for NVIDIA Corporation and their recommendation to clients is Buy. That implies a downside of 5% to their target. Weird eh? A Buy but the target price is lower! Is this a case of Wall Street brokers being behind the curve? 3 months ago the consensus price target was $64 when the stock was at $63. fail, Wall Street! Valuation The only business that's pricier is Mobileye. Surprise eh? And when I look at it's market value on $47bn versus Qualcomm on $99bn, it feels odd.
