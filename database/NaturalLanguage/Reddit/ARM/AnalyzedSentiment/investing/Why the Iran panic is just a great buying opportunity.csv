,"A conflict with Iran cannot seriously hurt the American or global economy. The selloffs we're seeing right now are panic reactions, driven by investors' ignorance of Iran's actual capabilities and geopolitical status, as well as far too much credence to Iranian propaganda aimed to misrepresent themselves as a regional power that can unleash hell. Iran does not have the capability to significantly disrupt the global oil supply. Not even by the classic ""attacking tankers in the Straits of Hormuz"" tactic. Their navy is very old, poorly maintained, technologically backwards, and simply no match to modern navies like the US or UK. Half their navy was casually sunk by the US in Operation Praying Mantis, and since then they had no strategy or build up of large-vessel navy power. They've been making plenty of threats, because they want to be seen as a strong, menacing regional superpower that should not be pushed around, but the only navy action they took recently was taking over a civilian tanker which was left defenseless, using commando tactics and small boats - practically, all their navy has and is right now. They tried the same tactics in the presence of a single British warship, and it drove their small, weak, poorly-armed boats away immediately. In reality they just don't have the sort of navy that can effectively block shipping, even just in the Straits of Hormuz, when faced with any sort of modern navy opposition. Their airforce is likewise ancient and useless. At the height of the recent clash, they flew some fighter jets along their borders. Guess what jets these were? F-14s, from the 1970s, sold to the Shah by the US. They have no spare parts for these, and except for flying short distances, these planes can do nothing. Not that even a fully supplied F-14 in top shape could do much against an F-22 with its modern air-to-air missiles. The F-14 would go down without even knowing what hit it or seeing the F-22 on radar at all. The only part of the Iranian force that's sort-of-effective is its missile and rocket force. That's what they used in their only successful strategic operation: their attack on Saudi oil facilities. Their biggest threat is repeating such operations. However, if they cause too much damage, the Saudis and/or US will retaliate by taking out Iran's own refineries and other oil facilities, which will be a death blow to Iranian economy that is already teetering. The Iranians have no real capability to prevent such a counterstrike, certainly not by modern stealth bombers. Finally, Iran doesn't have allies to effectively aid it in conflict, let alone snowball such a conflict into anything like a world war, as some of the shrillest panic responses are shrieking. Most of its neighbors are not particular friendly, especially Saudi Arabia which has been at de-facto war with Iran for years. Iran's only loyal allies are sub-state and pseudo-state actors, with which it acquired influence via the provision of weapons, military aid, and cash (which its current depressed economy can ill-afford). The Assad regime is the closest thing to a state-level ally they have, and that regime is effectively a puppet government run by the Russians, controlling a fairly small part of Syria. The Russians themselves are not their friends, and anyone claiming the Russians would enter a conflict against the US to protect the Iranians is entirely ignorant of their actual geopolitical situation. The Russians would enter such a conflict only to defend one nation and that is Russia. The Russians are in no position to enter a conflict with the US just to aid an ally, and even if they were, Iran wouldn't be in their list of allies. All of Iran's other allies are sub-state actors that are typically classified as terror groups, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iraq, and Houthi rebel groups in Yemen. These are very large, well-funded, well-trained, and well-armed - as far as such groups go. They are proficient in guerilla and terror operations under asymmetric conditions. However, they are not military forces, and will not be able to accomplish any of the strategic goals that Iran itself can't achieve, such as disrupting oil shipment or meaningfully harming global trade or economy in any other way. Of course, the idea that they can effectively fight back against the US, NATO, or any modern European nation is a complete joke; quite simply, they have no navy nor airforce. The only way they can get to the US is by buying an airline ticket. They could launch some terror attacks but that's it. TL;DR Iran greatly exaggerates its own capabilities and threats because it's in a tough position, while its actual options are limited. It cannot meaningfully disrupt global oil supply, or any other aspect of global trade or economy. Recent spikes in oil and dips in market indices were caused by typical panicking investors who lend these threads too much credit because they're not aware of the real status of Iranian military capabilities and Iran's true geopolitical standing.","Normally I would say that there has to be some sort of price decline for an ""opportunistic panic""",0,0.508,NEGATIVE,0.994

They've been making plenty of threats, because they want to be seen as a strong, menacing regional superpower that should not be pushed around, but the only navy action they took recently was taking over a civilian tanker which was left defenseless, using commando tactics and small boats - practically, all their navy has and is right now. They tried the same tactics in the presence of a single British warship, and it drove their small, weak, poorly-armed boats away immediately. In reality they just don't have the sort of navy that can effectively block shipping, even just in the Straits of Hormuz, when faced with any sort of modern navy opposition. Their airforce is likewise ancient and useless. At the height of the recent clash, they flew some fighter jets along their borders. Guess what jets these were? F-14s, from the 1970s, sold to the Shah by the US. They have no spare parts for these, and except for flying short distances, these planes can do nothing. Not that even a fully supplied F-14 in top shape could do much against an F-22 with its modern air-to-air missiles. The F-14 would go down without even knowing what hit it or seeing the F-22 on radar at all. The only part of the Iranian force that's sort-of-effective is its missile and rocket force. That's what they used in their only successful strategic operation: their attack on Saudi oil facilities. Their biggest threat is repeating such operations. However, if they cause too much damage, the Saudis and/or US will retaliate by taking out Iran's own refineries and other oil facilities, which will be a death blow to Iranian economy that is already teetering. The Iranians have no real capability to prevent such a counterstrike, certainly not by modern stealth bombers. Finally, Iran doesn't have allies to effectively aid it in conflict, let alone snowball such a conflict into anything like a world war, as some of the shrillest panic responses are shrieking. Most of its neighbors are not particular friendly, especially Saudi Arabia which has been at de-facto war with Iran for years. Iran's only loyal allies are sub-state and pseudo-state actors, with which it acquired influence via the provision of weapons, military aid, and cash (which its current depressed economy can ill-afford). The Assad regime is the closest thing to a state-level ally they have, and that regime is effectively a puppet government run by the Russians, controlling a fairly small part of Syria. The Russians themselves are not their friends, and anyone claiming the Russians would enter a conflict against the US to protect the Iranians is entirely ignorant of their actual geopolitical situation. The Russians would enter such a conflict only to defend one nation and that is Russia. The Russians are in no position to enter a conflict with the US just to aid an ally, and even if they were, Iran wouldn't be in their list of allies. All of Iran's other allies are sub-state actors that are typically classified as terror groups, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iraq, and Houthi rebel groups in Yemen. These are very large, well-funded, well-trained, and well-armed - as far as such groups go. They are proficient in guerilla and terror operations under asymmetric conditions. However, they are not military forces, and will not be able to accomplish any of the strategic goals that Iran itself can't achieve, such as disrupting oil shipment or meaningfully harming global trade or economy in any other way. Of course, the idea that they can effectively fight back against the US, NATO, or any modern European nation is a complete joke; quite simply, they have no navy nor airforce. The only way they can get to the US is by buying an airline ticket. They could launch some terror attacks but that's it. TL;DR Iran greatly exaggerates its own capabilities and threats because it's in a tough position, while its actual options are limited. It cannot meaningfully disrupt global oil supply, or any other aspect of global trade or economy.

Their navy is very old, poorly maintained, technologically backwards, and simply no match to modern navies like the US or UK. Half their navy was casually sunk by the US in Operation Praying Mantis, and since then they had no strategy or build up of large-vessel navy power. They've been making plenty of threats, because they want to be seen as a strong, menacing regional superpower that should not be pushed around, but the only navy action they took recently was taking over a civilian tanker which was left defenseless, using commando tactics and small boats - practically, all their navy has and is right now. They tried the same tactics in the presence of a single British warship, and it drove their small, weak, poorly-armed boats away immediately. In reality they just don't have the sort of navy that can effectively block shipping, even just in the Straits of Hormuz, when faced with any sort of modern navy opposition. Their airforce is likewise ancient and useless. At the height of the recent clash, they flew some fighter jets along their borders. Guess what jets these were? F-14s, from the 1970s, sold to the Shah by the US. They have no spare parts for these, and except for flying short distances, these planes can do nothing. Not that even a fully supplied F-14 in top shape could do much against an F-22 with its modern air-to-air missiles. The F-14 would go down without even knowing what hit it or seeing the F-22 on radar at all. The only part of the Iranian force that's sort-of-effective is its missile and rocket force. That's what they used in their only successful strategic operation: their attack on Saudi oil facilities. Their biggest threat is repeating such operations. However, if they cause too much damage, the Saudis and/or US will retaliate by taking out Iran's own refineries and other oil facilities, which will be a death blow to Iranian economy that is already teetering. The Iranians have no real capability to prevent such a counterstrike, certainly not by modern stealth bombers. Finally, Iran doesn't have allies to effectively aid it in conflict, let alone snowball such a conflict into anything like a world war, as some of the shrillest panic responses are shrieking. Most of its neighbors are not particular friendly, especially Saudi Arabia which has been at de-facto war with Iran for years. Iran's only loyal allies are sub-state and pseudo-state actors, with which it acquired influence via the provision of weapons, military aid, and cash (which its current depressed economy can ill-afford). The Assad regime is the closest thing to a state-level ally they have, and that regime is effectively a puppet government run by the Russians, controlling a fairly small part of Syria. The Russians themselves are not their friends, and anyone claiming the Russians would enter a conflict against the US to protect the Iranians is entirely ignorant of their actual geopolitical situation. The Russians would enter such a conflict only to defend one nation and that is Russia. The Russians are in no position to enter a conflict with the US just to aid an ally, and even if they were, Iran wouldn't be in their list of allies. All of Iran's other allies are sub-state actors that are typically classified as terror groups, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iraq, and Houthi rebel groups in Yemen. These are very large, well-funded, well-trained, and well-armed - as far as such groups go. They are proficient in guerilla and terror operations under asymmetric conditions. However, they are not military forces, and will not be able to accomplish any of the strategic goals that Iran itself can't achieve, such as disrupting oil shipment or meaningfully harming global trade or economy in any other way. Of course, the idea that they can effectively fight back against the US, NATO, or any modern European nation is a complete joke; quite simply, they have no navy nor airforce. The only way they can get to the US is by buying an airline ticket. They could launch some terror attacks but that's it. TL;DR Iran greatly exaggerates its own capabilities and threats because it's in a tough position, while its actual options are limited. It cannot meaningfully disrupt global oil supply, or any other aspect of global trade or economy.

Iran does not have the capability to significantly disrupt the global oil supply. Not even by the classic ""attacking tankers in the Straits of Hormuz"" tactic. Their navy is very old, poorly maintained, technologically backwards, and simply no match to modern navies like the US or UK. Half their navy was casually sunk by the US in Operation Praying Mantis, and since then they had no strategy or build up of large-vessel navy power. They've been making plenty of threats, because they want to be seen as a strong, menacing regional superpower that should not be pushed around, but the only navy action they took recently was taking over a civilian tanker which was left defenseless, using commando tactics and small boats - practically, all their navy has and is right now. They tried the same tactics in the presence of a single British warship, and it drove their small, weak, poorly-armed boats away immediately. In reality they just don't have the sort of navy that can effectively block shipping, even just in the Straits of Hormuz, when faced with any sort of modern navy opposition. Their airforce is likewise ancient and useless. At the height of the recent clash, they flew some fighter jets along their borders. Guess what jets these were? F-14s, from the 1970s, sold to the Shah by the US. They have no spare parts for these, and except for flying short distances, these planes can do nothing. Not that even a fully supplied F-14 in top shape could do much against an F-22 with its modern air-to-air missiles. The F-14 would go down without even knowing what hit it or seeing the F-22 on radar at all. The only part of the Iranian force that's sort-of-effective is its missile and rocket force. That's what they used in their only successful strategic operation: their attack on Saudi oil facilities. Their biggest threat is repeating such operations. However, if they cause too much damage, the Saudis and/or US will retaliate by taking out Iran's own refineries and other oil facilities, which will be a death blow to Iranian economy that is already teetering. The Iranians have no real capability to prevent such a counterstrike, certainly not by modern stealth bombers. Finally, Iran doesn't have allies to effectively aid it in conflict, let alone snowball such a conflict into anything like a world war, as some of the shrillest panic responses are shrieking. Most of its neighbors are not particular friendly, especially Saudi Arabia which has been at de-facto war with Iran for years. Iran's only loyal allies are sub-state and pseudo-state actors, with which it acquired influence via the provision of weapons, military aid, and cash (which its current depressed economy can ill-afford). The Assad regime is the closest thing to a state-level ally they have, and that regime is effectively a puppet government run by the Russians, controlling a fairly small part of Syria. The Russians themselves are not their friends, and anyone claiming the Russians would enter a conflict against the US to protect the Iranians is entirely ignorant of their actual geopolitical situation. The Russians would enter such a conflict only to defend one nation and that is Russia. The Russians are in no position to enter a conflict with the US just to aid an ally, and even if they were, Iran wouldn't be in their list of allies.

The Iranians have no real capability to prevent such a counterstrike, certainly not by modern stealth bombers. Finally, Iran doesn't have allies to effectively aid it in conflict, let alone snowball such a conflict into anything like a world war, as some of the shrillest panic responses are shrieking. Most of its neighbors are not particular friendly, especially Saudi Arabia which has been at de-facto war with Iran for years. Iran's only loyal allies are sub-state and pseudo-state actors, with which it acquired influence via the provision of weapons, military aid, and cash (which its current depressed economy can ill-afford). The Assad regime is the closest thing to a state-level ally they have, and that regime is effectively a puppet government run by the Russians, controlling a fairly small part of Syria. The Russians themselves are not their friends, and anyone claiming the Russians would enter a conflict against the US to protect the Iranians is entirely ignorant of their actual geopolitical situation. The Russians would enter such a conflict only to defend one nation and that is Russia. The Russians are in no position to enter a conflict with the US just to aid an ally, and even if they were, Iran wouldn't be in their list of allies. All of Iran's other allies are sub-state actors that are typically classified as terror groups, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iraq, and Houthi rebel groups in Yemen. These are very large, well-funded, well-trained, and well-armed - as far as such groups go. They are proficient in guerilla and terror operations under asymmetric conditions. However, they are not military forces, and will not be able to accomplish any of the strategic goals that Iran itself can't achieve, such as disrupting oil shipment or meaningfully harming global trade or economy in any other way. Of course, the idea that they can effectively fight back against the US, NATO, or any modern European nation is a complete joke; quite simply, they have no navy nor airforce. The only way they can get to the US is by buying an airline ticket. They could launch some terror attacks but that's it. TL;DR Iran greatly exaggerates its own capabilities and threats because it's in a tough position, while its actual options are limited. It cannot meaningfully disrupt global oil supply, or any other aspect of global trade or economy. Recent spikes in oil and dips in market indices were caused by typical panicking investors who lend these threads too much credit because they're not aware of the real status of Iranian military capabilities and Iran's true geopolitical standing.","Uuuuuh... tension in the Middle East certainly impacted, quite dramatically, markets in the 70s and 80s.Also, 9/11.I’m not saying something certainly will or will not happen.

,"A conflict with Iran cannot seriously hurt the American or global economy. The selloffs we're seeing right now are panic reactions, driven by investors' ignorance of Iran's actual capabilities and geopolitical status, as well as far too much credence to Iranian propaganda aimed to misrepresent themselves as a regional power that can unleash hell.

They've been making plenty of threats, because they want to be seen as a strong, menacing regional superpower that should not be pushed around, but the only navy action they took recently was taking over a civilian tanker which was left defenseless, using commando tactics and small boats - practically, all their navy has and is right now. They tried the same tactics in the presence of a single British warship, and it drove their small, weak, poorly-armed boats away immediately. In reality they just don't have the sort of navy that can effectively block shipping, even just in the Straits of Hormuz, when faced with any sort of modern navy opposition. Their airforce is likewise ancient and useless. At the height of the recent clash, they flew some fighter jets along their borders. Guess what jets these were? F-14s, from the 1970s, sold to the Shah by the US. They have no spare parts for these, and except for flying short distances, these planes can do nothing.

The two worst crises of this period were the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 energy crisis, when the Yom Kippur War and the Iranian Revolution triggered interruptions in Middle Eastern oil exports.The crisis began to unfold as petroleum production in the United States and some other parts of the world peaked in the late 1960s and early 1970s. World oil production per capita began a long-term decline after 1979.The major industrial centers of the world were forced to contend with escalating issues related to petroleum supply.

F-14s, from the 1970s, sold to the Shah by the US. They have no spare parts for these, and except for flying short distances, these planes can do nothing. Not that even a fully supplied F-14 in top shape could do much against an F-22 with its modern air-to-air missiles. The F-14 would go down without even knowing what hit it or seeing the F-22 on radar at all. The only part of the Iranian force that's sort-of-effective is its missile and rocket force. That's what they used in their only successful strategic operation: their attack on Saudi oil facilities. Their biggest threat is repeating such operations. However, if they cause too much damage, the Saudis and/or US will retaliate by taking out Iran's own refineries and other oil facilities, which will be a death blow to Iranian economy that is already teetering. The Iranians have no real capability to prevent such a counterstrike, certainly not by modern stealth bombers. Finally, Iran doesn't have allies to effectively aid it in conflict, let alone snowball such a conflict into anything like a world war, as some of the shrillest panic responses are shrieking. Most of its neighbors are not particular friendly, especially Saudi Arabia which has been at de-facto war with Iran for years. Iran's only loyal allies are sub-state and pseudo-state actors, with which it acquired influence via the provision of weapons, military aid, and cash (which its current depressed economy can ill-afford). The Assad regime is the closest thing to a state-level ally they have, and that regime is effectively a puppet government run by the Russians, controlling a fairly small part of Syria. The Russians themselves are not their friends, and anyone claiming the Russians would enter a conflict against the US to protect the Iranians is entirely ignorant of their actual geopolitical situation. The Russians would enter such a conflict only to defend one nation and that is Russia. The Russians are in no position to enter a conflict with the US just to aid an ally, and even if they were, Iran wouldn't be in their list of allies. All of Iran's other allies are sub-state actors that are typically classified as terror groups, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iraq, and Houthi rebel groups in Yemen. These are very large, well-funded, well-trained, and well-armed - as far as such groups go. They are proficient in guerilla and terror operations under asymmetric conditions. However, they are not military forces, and will not be able to accomplish any of the strategic goals that Iran itself can't achieve, such as disrupting oil shipment or meaningfully harming global trade or economy in any other way. Of course, the idea that they can effectively fight back against the US, NATO, or any modern European nation is a complete joke; quite simply, they have no navy nor airforce. The only way they can get to the US is by buying an airline ticket. They could launch some terror attacks but that's it.

In reality they just don't have the sort of navy that can effectively block shipping, even just in the Straits of Hormuz, when faced with any sort of modern navy opposition. Their airforce is likewise ancient and useless. At the height of the recent clash, they flew some fighter jets along their borders. Guess what jets these were? F-14s, from the 1970s, sold to the Shah by the US. They have no spare parts for these, and except for flying short distances, these planes can do nothing. Not that even a fully supplied F-14 in top shape could do much against an F-22 with its modern air-to-air missiles. The F-14 would go down without even knowing what hit it or seeing the F-22 on radar at all. The only part of the Iranian force that's sort-of-effective is its missile and rocket force. That's what they used in their only successful strategic operation: their attack on Saudi oil facilities. Their biggest threat is repeating such operations. However, if they cause too much damage, the Saudis and/or US will retaliate by taking out Iran's own refineries and other oil facilities, which will be a death blow to Iranian economy that is already teetering. The Iranians have no real capability to prevent such a counterstrike, certainly not by modern stealth bombers. Finally, Iran doesn't have allies to effectively aid it in conflict, let alone snowball such a conflict into anything like a world war, as some of the shrillest panic responses are shrieking. Most of its neighbors are not particular friendly, especially Saudi Arabia which has been at de-facto war with Iran for years. Iran's only loyal allies are sub-state and pseudo-state actors, with which it acquired influence via the provision of weapons, military aid, and cash (which its current depressed economy can ill-afford). The Assad regime is the closest thing to a state-level ally they have, and that regime is effectively a puppet government run by the Russians, controlling a fairly small part of Syria. The Russians themselves are not their friends, and anyone claiming the Russians would enter a conflict against the US to protect the Iranians is entirely ignorant of their actual geopolitical situation. The Russians would enter such a conflict only to defend one nation and that is Russia. The Russians are in no position to enter a conflict with the US just to aid an ally, and even if they were, Iran wouldn't be in their list of allies. All of Iran's other allies are sub-state actors that are typically classified as terror groups, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iraq, and Houthi rebel groups in Yemen. These are very large, well-funded, well-trained, and well-armed - as far as such groups go. They are proficient in guerilla and terror operations under asymmetric conditions. However, they are not military forces, and will not be able to accomplish any of the strategic goals that Iran itself can't achieve, such as disrupting oil shipment or meaningfully harming global trade or economy in any other way. Of course, the idea that they can effectively fight back against the US, NATO, or any modern European nation is a complete joke; quite simply, they have no navy nor airforce. The only way they can get to the US is by buying an airline ticket. They could launch some terror attacks but that's it. TL;DR Iran greatly exaggerates its own capabilities and threats because it's in a tough position, while its actual options are limited.

The selloffs we're seeing right now are panic reactions, driven by investors' ignorance of Iran's actual capabilities and geopolitical status, as well as far too much credence to Iranian propaganda aimed to misrepresent themselves as a regional power that can unleash hell. Iran does not have the capability to significantly disrupt the global oil supply. Not even by the classic ""attacking tankers in the Straits of Hormuz"" tactic. Their navy is very old, poorly maintained, technologically backwards, and simply no match to modern navies like the US or UK. Half their navy was casually sunk by the US in Operation Praying Mantis, and since then they had no strategy or build up of large-vessel navy power. They've been making plenty of threats, because they want to be seen as a strong, menacing regional superpower that should not be pushed around, but the only navy action they took recently was taking over a civilian tanker which was left defenseless, using commando tactics and small boats - practically, all their navy has and is right now. They tried the same tactics in the presence of a single British warship, and it drove their small, weak, poorly-armed boats away immediately. In reality they just don't have the sort of navy that can effectively block shipping, even just in the Straits of Hormuz, when faced with any sort of modern navy opposition. Their airforce is likewise ancient and useless. At the height of the recent clash, they flew some fighter jets along their borders. Guess what jets these were? F-14s, from the 1970s, sold to the Shah by the US. They have no spare parts for these, and except for flying short distances, these planes can do nothing. Not that even a fully supplied F-14 in top shape could do much against an F-22 with its modern air-to-air missiles. The F-14 would go down without even knowing what hit it or seeing the F-22 on radar at all. The only part of the Iranian force that's sort-of-effective is its missile and rocket force. That's what they used in their only successful strategic operation: their attack on Saudi oil facilities. Their biggest threat is repeating such operations. However, if they cause too much damage, the Saudis and/or US will retaliate by taking out Iran's own refineries and other oil facilities, which will be a death blow to Iranian economy that is already teetering. The Iranians have no real capability to prevent such a counterstrike, certainly not by modern stealth bombers. Finally, Iran doesn't have allies to effectively aid it in conflict, let alone snowball such a conflict into anything like a world war, as some of the shrillest panic responses are shrieking. Most of its neighbors are not particular friendly, especially Saudi Arabia which has been at de-facto war with Iran for years. Iran's only loyal allies are sub-state and pseudo-state actors, with which it acquired influence via the provision of weapons, military aid, and cash (which its current depressed economy can ill-afford). The Assad regime is the closest thing to a state-level ally they have, and that regime is effectively a puppet government run by the Russians, controlling a fairly small part of Syria. The Russians themselves are not their friends, and anyone claiming the Russians would enter a conflict against the US to protect the Iranians is entirely ignorant of their actual geopolitical situation. The Russians would enter such a conflict only to defend one nation and that is Russia. The Russians are in no position to enter a conflict with the US just to aid an ally, and even if they were, Iran wouldn't be in their list of allies. All of Iran's other allies are sub-state actors that are typically classified as terror groups, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iraq, and Houthi rebel groups in Yemen. These are very large, well-funded, well-trained, and well-armed - as far as such groups go. They are proficient in guerilla and terror operations under asymmetric conditions. However, they are not military forces, and will not be able to accomplish any of the strategic goals that Iran itself can't achieve, such as disrupting oil shipment or meaningfully harming global trade or economy in any other way. Of course, the idea that they can effectively fight back against the US, NATO, or any modern European nation is a complete joke; quite simply, they have no navy nor airforce. The only way they can get to the US is by buying an airline ticket. They could launch some terror attacks but that's it. TL;DR Iran greatly exaggerates its own capabilities and threats because it's in a tough position, while its actual options are limited. It cannot meaningfully disrupt global oil supply, or any other aspect of global trade or economy.

The Russians are in no position to enter a conflict with the US just to aid an ally, and even if they were, Iran wouldn't be in their list of allies.

,"A conflict with Iran cannot seriously hurt the American or global economy. The selloffs we're seeing right now are panic reactions, driven by investors' ignorance of Iran's actual capabilities and geopolitical status, as well as far too much credence to Iranian propaganda aimed to misrepresent themselves as a regional power that can unleash hell. Iran does not have the capability to significantly disrupt the global oil supply. Not even by the classic ""attacking tankers in the Straits of Hormuz"" tactic. Their navy is very old, poorly maintained, technologically backwards, and simply no match to modern navies like the US or UK. Half their navy was casually sunk by the US in Operation Praying Mantis, and since then they had no strategy or build up of large-vessel navy power. They've been making plenty of threats, because they want to be seen as a strong, menacing regional superpower that should not be pushed around, but the only navy action they took recently was taking over a civilian tanker which was left defenseless, using commando tactics and small boats - practically, all their navy has and is right now. They tried the same tactics in the presence of a single British warship, and it drove their small, weak, poorly-armed boats away immediately. In reality they just don't have the sort of navy that can effectively block shipping, even just in the Straits of Hormuz, when faced with any sort of modern navy opposition. Their airforce is likewise ancient and useless. At the height of the recent clash, they flew some fighter jets along their borders. Guess what jets these were? F-14s, from the 1970s, sold to the Shah by the US. They have no spare parts for these, and except for flying short distances, these planes can do nothing. Not that even a fully supplied F-14 in top shape could do much against an F-22 with its modern air-to-air missiles. The F-14 would go down without even knowing what hit it or seeing the F-22 on radar at all. The only part of the Iranian force that's sort-of-effective is its missile and rocket force. That's what they used in their only successful strategic operation: their attack on Saudi oil facilities. Their biggest threat is repeating such operations. However, if they cause too much damage, the Saudis and/or US will retaliate by taking out Iran's own refineries and other oil facilities, which will be a death blow to Iranian economy that is already teetering. The Iranians have no real capability to prevent such a counterstrike, certainly not by modern stealth bombers. Finally, Iran doesn't have allies to effectively aid it in conflict, let alone snowball such a conflict into anything like a world war, as some of the shrillest panic responses are shrieking. Most of its neighbors are not particular friendly, especially Saudi Arabia which has been at de-facto war with Iran for years. Iran's only loyal allies are sub-state and pseudo-state actors, with which it acquired influence via the provision of weapons, military aid, and cash (which its current depressed economy can ill-afford). The Assad regime is the closest thing to a state-level ally they have, and that regime is effectively a puppet government run by the Russians, controlling a fairly small part of Syria.

All of Iran's other allies are sub-state actors that are typically classified as terror groups, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iraq, and Houthi rebel groups in Yemen. These are very large, well-funded, well-trained, and well-armed - as far as such groups go. They are proficient in guerilla and terror operations under asymmetric conditions. However, they are not military forces, and will not be able to accomplish any of the strategic goals that Iran itself can't achieve, such as disrupting oil shipment or meaningfully harming global trade or economy in any other way. Of course, the idea that they can effectively fight back against the US, NATO, or any modern European nation is a complete joke; quite simply, they have no navy nor airforce. The only way they can get to the US is by buying an airline ticket. They could launch some terror attacks but that's it. TL;DR Iran greatly exaggerates its own capabilities and threats because it's in a tough position, while its actual options are limited.

,"A conflict with Iran cannot seriously hurt the American or global economy. The selloffs we're seeing right now are panic reactions, driven by investors' ignorance of Iran's actual capabilities and geopolitical status, as well as far too much credence to Iranian propaganda aimed to misrepresent themselves as a regional power that can unleash hell. Iran does not have the capability to significantly disrupt the global oil supply. Not even by the classic ""attacking tankers in the Straits of Hormuz"" tactic. Their navy is very old, poorly maintained, technologically backwards, and simply no match to modern navies like the US or UK. Half their navy was casually sunk by the US in Operation Praying Mantis, and since then they had no strategy or build up of large-vessel navy power. They've been making plenty of threats, because they want to be seen as a strong, menacing regional superpower that should not be pushed around, but the only navy action they took recently was taking over a civilian tanker which was left defenseless, using commando tactics and small boats - practically, all their navy has and is right now. They tried the same tactics in the presence of a single British warship, and it drove their small, weak, poorly-armed boats away immediately. In reality they just don't have the sort of navy that can effectively block shipping, even just in the Straits of Hormuz, when faced with any sort of modern navy opposition. Their airforce is likewise ancient and useless. At the height of the recent clash, they flew some fighter jets along their borders. Guess what jets these were? F-14s, from the 1970s, sold to the Shah by the US. They have no spare parts for these, and except for flying short distances, these planes can do nothing. Not that even a fully supplied F-14 in top shape could do much against an F-22 with its modern air-to-air missiles. The F-14 would go down without even knowing what hit it or seeing the F-22 on radar at all. The only part of the Iranian force that's sort-of-effective is its missile and rocket force. That's what they used in their only successful strategic operation: their attack on Saudi oil facilities. Their biggest threat is repeating such operations. However, if they cause too much damage, the Saudis and/or US will retaliate by taking out Iran's own refineries and other oil facilities, which will be a death blow to Iranian economy that is already teetering. The Iranians have no real capability to prevent such a counterstrike, certainly not by modern stealth bombers. Finally, Iran doesn't have allies to effectively aid it in conflict, let alone snowball such a conflict into anything like a world war, as some of the shrillest panic responses are shrieking. Most of its neighbors are not particular friendly, especially Saudi Arabia which has been at de-facto war with Iran for years. Iran's only loyal allies are sub-state and pseudo-state actors, with which it acquired influence via the provision of weapons, military aid, and cash (which its current depressed economy can ill-afford). The Assad regime is the closest thing to a state-level ally they have, and that regime is effectively a puppet government run by the Russians, controlling a fairly small part of Syria. The Russians themselves are not their friends, and anyone claiming the Russians would enter a conflict against the US to protect the Iranians is entirely ignorant of their actual geopolitical situation.
