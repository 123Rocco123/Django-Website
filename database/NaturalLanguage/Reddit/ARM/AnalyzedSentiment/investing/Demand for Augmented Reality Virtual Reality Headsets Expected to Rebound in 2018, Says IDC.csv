,"Link What are your thoughts on the VR industry? Where do you think the best areas to invest in are? I am thinking that the video card industry will see another arms race boom, similar to what we saw with respect to bitcoin. Probably not as intense and sharp, but seeing as how GPUs are one of the primary limiting factors to producing high quality VR, I suspect that there will be a race to develop this technology further and also the quickest.",3D curve flatscreens 2.0.No one cares about this shit but geeks and gamers,0,0.51,NEGATIVE,0.999

Geeks and gamers care only in the sense that they are the typical early adopters. There are many consumer and business applications to AR and VR tech and there is a technical path to reduction of cost. You won’t see people walking down the streets with Oculus VR’s but augmented reality lenses would have a high adoption rate.,1,0.519,NEGATIVE,0.869

I just don't see where the demand will come from",0,0.518,NEGATIVE,1.0

VR today is like what buying a palm pilot in the early 2000’s was like. It’s not good enough yet, but the vision is there.Facebook owns Oculus and is good at distributing ads. Unless someone else jumps in, they are a prime contender to take advantage of the virtual ad space.",3,0.514,NEGATIVE,0.637

Insane future potential but I think it will still be a few years before it hits the mainstream.,0,0.516,NEGATIVE,0.891

You gotta shell out some cash to enjoy VR (not a stutter-y low quality experience). I’m not optimistic about this part of gaming, business-wise, because it’s reliant on hardware manufacturers & producers to step their game up.",0,0.518,NEGATIVE,1.0

Mostly about an arms race similar to what we saw with bit coin?In terms of VR I think it will be the content providers will profit in the long run. Facebook will have a good footing with devices, but I don’t think VR is really going to change how we consume entertainment. I personally can’t stand first person POV. I think it will have the largest impact in gaming of the all the entertainment sectors.",0,0.521,NEGATIVE,1.0

To me, it's investing in Facebook or Apple or other broadly diversified company and hoping that their efforts in VR eventually pay off but if not it wouldn't be the end of the world.",0,0.541,NEGATIVE,1.0
