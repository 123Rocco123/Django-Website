Basically, Westinghouse was this massive company with many different divisions and categories of products. They had a small market share in many different industries. The problem was many of their departments were not as profitable as they used to or they invested in many technologies that weren't as profitable as they thought. They were headed towards bankruptcy until they decided to sell a majority of the their assets and technology to other companies to gain a massive storage of cash. This cash was used to pay debt as well as other obligations. They ended up having leftover cash to use to diversify their company once again to be as big as it once was. So Westinghouse decided to buy what is now the cbs corporation. They've been doing pretty well ever since. I would check some of these facts because I read this a couple of months ago. Might be missing some facts, but the idea is the same. They were too big with many different products in many different markets. They sold their assets and bought cbs corp",3,0.548,NEGATIVE,1.0

,"Key Stats for General Electric Company It's the ultimate industrial conglomerate in the US, even more so than Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway! And it's been going strong 120+ years! From CEO to CEO to CEO. But it stumbled in finance. Has it got back on it's feet yet? |Ticker|GE |:---:|:---:| Sector | Industrial Conglomerates Latest price | $31.34 Value | $277,246M Daily vol | $1,091M Date | 25 November 2016 Useful Links Latest news from Yahoo Finance Latest results from SEC Edgar Website: ge.com Description They've a pretty clear description of themselves in the annual report! We are a global digital industrial company, transforming industry with software-defined machines and solutions that are connected, responsive and predictive. With products and services ranging from aircraft engines, power generation and oil and gas production equipment to medical imaging, financing and industrial products, we serve customers in approximately 180 countries and employ approximately 333,000 people worldwide. Since our incorporation in 1892, we have developed or acquired new technologies and services that have considerably broadened and changed the scope of our activities. Of course, one thing they aren't really highlighting is that they got themselves into a whole mess with their GE Capital arm. At one stage the venerable industrial business felt like its finance arm was here the real action was. But it came to an end with the Great Recession and in early 2015 they decided to largely get our of finance. Recent financials Here are the figures for the last 5 years, though it's not that informative, other than showing that the GE Capital business caused a major headache in 2015! Metric 2015A 2014A 2013A 2012A 2011A Revenue $117bn $117bn $113bn $113bn $110bn EPS $0.17 $0.94 $0.74 $0.82 $0.76 DPS $0.92 $0.89 $0.79 $0.70 $0.61 Though the headline figures don't give a really good picture. Here's what the Industrial only unit looks like, though this is their ""Adjusted EPS"". Metric 2015A 2014A 2013A 2012A 2011A Revenue $109bn $110bn $103bn $103bn $95bn EPS $1.31 $1.12 $1.00 N/A N/A If we look at that $109bn and the 8 major divisions, actually 4 division are 75% of it with 4 making up 25%. The main divisions are Aviation, Power, Healthcare, Oil & Gas. And you may have seen the recent announcement that they are merging their Oil & Gas into Baker Hughes. As for 2016... Industrial revenues increased $7.2 billion, or 9%, mainly from the effects of acquisitions of $9.3 billion, primarily Alstom. And earnings have done really well too, though flattered by the comparison with an ugly 2015! The exit from GE Capital So the GE Capital fiasco is nearing it's end. They've pulling in the financing arms for Aviation, Industrial & Healthcare Equipment and Oil & Gas. They've demerged the retail business, called Synchrony Financial. Reduced their asset base of GE Capital to $203bn from $501bn And in all the restructuring been able to buy back $20 billion of stock. Now...there have been charges and losses on the unwind, but the original estimate of a $23 billion hit to profits, has been stable. And may even be reined in. Competition When you've got 8 major divisions all generating billions of sales on a global basis, it's a bit meaningless to have a shortlist of key competitors. Especially if you are junking a whole troubled division. A straight comparison with Buffett, J&J or even IBM isn't too informative, as they aren't really ""industrial conglomerates""! Instead UTX or Siemens is probably a better match. At 12% margins it's below their levels, but their margin is hurt by the GE Capital business. If we look at the ""Industrial"" unit only the margin was a healthy 15%.

General Electric Company has $96,908M of net debt. That is 7x it's latest operating profit. Scary on the face of it. Take Ford as an example of a bank + company :) It's on 9x operating profit. But this isn't a great way to look at it, as it's still part a financial services company part an industrial conglomerate. On the total $150bn of debts, $100bn are inside the Finance arm...and banks tend to live by very different leverage levels than regular companies! Wall Street thinks? The professionals on Wall Street have a $32.46 for General Electric Company and their recommendation to clients is Buy. That implies an upside of 4% to their target. Valuation 4% upside and a Buy? Seems a little silly. Especially when it's on 21x earnings.

Why? I don't see the logic. If the idea that like Berkshire there is substantial value in the non-core assets? That once they are stripped out the adjusted PE is a lot lower? Dividends General Electric Company is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.94 per share, compared to a forecast EPS of $1.49. And on top of the regular dividend ,they are keen to create more value by disposals of remaining GE Capital units and return that cash to shareholders. Catalysts In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 0% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -1%. Though the stock is up 10% in the last month, following the 3Q results and Baker Hughes deal. On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers they refused to give guidance for 2017, but did say: We'll give you our 2017 outlook in December but all of our metrics for compensation purposes will continue to be linked to $2 of EPS in 2018 are aligned with investors. Buy how much would you pay for $2 of GE earnings? Is 15x today's price not fair? Is there some hidden value in the portfolio? Some ""investments"". A windfall from GE Capital? If there is, then I get the valuation. But if not, I'm left scratching my head. Okay, it's a quality stock, a great deal maker, constantly adjusting its portfolio. But it's hardly a bargain, in the way BRKB is when you take account of its investments. View the archive of Stock a Day posts at its subreddit r/stockaday.
