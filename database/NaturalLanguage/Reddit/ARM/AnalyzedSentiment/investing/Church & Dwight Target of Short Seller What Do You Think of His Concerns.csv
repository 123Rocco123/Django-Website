,Church & Dwight Bear Warns of Accounting ‘Gimmicks’ at Arm & Hammer’s Parent Activist short seller explains bet against Church & Dwight as due to ‘extreme overvaluation’,"Great company, but it still is crazy over valued. Overpaying for horizontal acquisitions is also concerning, but given that M&A is a significant part of their pedigree, and have a fantastic record with it, I will side with the company there.What’s more concerning is their size versus rivals (and the pricing power that comes with that), as well as over dependence on a few major retailers. Private label offerings are really cutting through packaged goods right now. If Walmart or amazon decided to stop carrying CHD products (or large branches of them) then CHD would be in some serious trouble. Margin pressure from price cuts to PG, CL, UL, and CLX products is almost certainly going to occur, as those bigger brands try to fight back against private labels.I might consider CHD at fair value in the low 60s.",0,0.544,NEGATIVE,0.98

,Church & Dwight Bear Warns of Accounting ‘Gimmicks’ at Arm & Hammer’s Parent Activist short seller explains bet against Church & Dwight as due to ‘extreme overvaluation’,"If we look at P/E and CAPE's of most consumer staples + some REITS like AMT we'll find that they are extremely overvalued. Some have P/Es near 100. It's possible that retail investors flocked to these ""safer"" assets as an attempt to find haven against the December selloff and recession woes. The irony is that by doing this, they've (we've) by some metric helped inflate a potential bubble in equities. I don't necessarily think retail investors buying these stocks attribute as much to the inflated prices as ETF purchases have. This is where value investing switched towards trend investing from my estimation.",2,0.514,NEGATIVE,0.997
