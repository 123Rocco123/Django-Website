,"The new 2023 Q3 figures come from a market analysis firm named Omdia (via Tom's Hardware): Meta and Microsoft, each purchasing 150,000 GPUs. Those two companies were responsible for 300,000 units, with the other 200,000 going to the rest: Oracle, Tencent, Google, and Amazon, Tesla, TickTok, Baidu, Alibaba. Q3 reported revenue was 18 bills. The reported 500k number seems to be true. Now the question is, who will be ordering another 500k batch in Q4? so that at least the Q4 result won't pale in comparison and won't be a disappointment for investors? META to the rescue (Hopefully)! As Zuckerberg stated: “By the end of this year, we’re going to have around 350,000 Nvidia H100s. Or around 600,000 H100 equivalents of compute if you include other GPUs.” , which means they might order another 200k from Nvidia, or he may ""find 2*x H100 equivalent to compute"" to avoid paying a premium over generally specialized Nvidia GPUs and buy more specialized and power-to-output optimized ASICs chips like Google's TPUs. I don't think other big tech (Microsoft, OpenAI, and AWS) giants will order more GPUs because running a general-purpose GPU is very expensive: Running ChatGPT is very expensive for the company. Each query costs roughly 4 cents, according to an analysis from Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. Google already has its own ASICs chips called TPU. Apple also has an edge with its M3 chips family. If their name is not on the Nvidia order line list yet, then they are certainly cooking some big updates to their M chip family. Everyone has shown with their dollar that they aren't willing to pay a high NVIDIA premium in the long run. And want to diversify to other chip makers, like AMD, Intel, and specialized ARM makers. Small businesses experiment and run their AI models using rented Amazon, Microsoft, and Google cloud capacities (mostly Google because of their TPU's low power-to-cost ratio). The rest of the market is peanuts to make any dent. [Conclusions]: Their a moderate-low probability Q4 revenues will reach a plateau of around 15-20 billion. A moderate probability that they will be below 15 billion. A low probability of exceeding 20 billion. Let's sidestep to AI marker TAM topic, Meanwhile, looking forward to 2027, the server market's value is estimated at a staggering $195.6 billion. However, this estimated revenue will be brought by those who rent AI processing capacities like AWS, GCP, and Azure cloud providers. And not ChatGPT clones. The market has not figured yet the TAM (total addressable market) of services like ChatGPT. However, I try to speculate on open numbers, which have stagnated for the last 6 months. 100 million monthly active users * 10$ per subscription produces 1 billion in revenue. The average cost of 1 query from a used is 4 cents. A single user runs 2,000 queries per month on average. The query is a single text message you send to the chatbot. 2000 * 0.04 = 80 $ to service 1 user per month. Until the OpenAI level of efficiency improves they will be losing 70$ to service 1 user per month. No wonder OpenAI has closed its ChatGPT Plus subscription. It doesn't seem sustainable. Last note, the majority of data centers upgrade their equipment every 4-5 years. So, if AI expectations won't burst, and chip efficiency improves 10-fold, and other chip makers won't catch up, don't expect big tech to re-stock their chips earlier than the end of 2027.","This is the worst analysis I've ever seen. ""M3 has an edge."" It's laughable.Nvidia is sold out, every chip they can make for the entire year. They will report more than $20B, it's guaranteed, not ""a low probability of exceeding."" Why? Just look at what the CFO said during the last call:""Revenue is expected to be $20.00 billion, plus or minus 2%.GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.5% and 75.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points.""$20B is in the bag and they will be on a $100B run rate ($25B/qtr) before the end of the year.",0,0.561,NEGATIVE,1.0

The query is a single text message you send to the chatbot. 2000 * 0.04 = 80 $ to service 1 user per month. Until the OpenAI level of efficiency improves they will be losing 70$ to service 1 user per month. No wonder OpenAI has closed its ChatGPT Plus subscription. It doesn't seem sustainable.

,"The new 2023 Q3 figures come from a market analysis firm named Omdia (via Tom's Hardware): Meta and Microsoft, each purchasing 150,000 GPUs.
