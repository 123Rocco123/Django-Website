Subject: Canopy Rivers (RIV) - one of the best risk/reward opportunities in the Cannabis space üì∑ Canopy Rivers (RIV) represents one of the best risk/reward opportunities in the cannabis space. Shares trade at a meaningful discount to its public comps due to its non traditional structure and valuation opacity. However**, its 130kg+ production facility is almost near completion and I believe recognition of its development and ultimate cash flow potential will result in a material re-rating.**  I calculate a Sum of the Parts (SOTP) valuation of $11.76/sh, or 227% upside from current levels based on a relative valuation analysis vs. Village Farms (VFF). Note this is my personal sales view and does not represent our Research views. Background RIV is known as the ‚ÄúVenture Capital‚Äù arm of Canopy Growth, and with that, holds a number of investments. Of these, RIV‚Äôs Pharmhouse stake (49% ownership) represents a material part of their NAV, and I would argue is being significantly undervalued within the current share price.  What is Pharmhouse? Pharmhouse (PH) is a joint venture with the Mastronardi Family (Link)) one of the largest tomato grower/distributors in the world. The family has 65 years of experience, and the JV is in the midst of converting 1.3M sq ft of greenhouse that has potential to produce 130kg/yr+. This is a high tech, highly automated, recently constructed facility (2017) that could be fully producing in calendar Q3/19. The facility is awaiting licensing that is expected shortly. Structured within the agreement, RIV has an option to buy into 49% of any future international endeavors at book value via its global non-compete with the partner. VFF is a very relevant comp If you‚Äôve followed the space, this story might sound familiar, as Village Farms (VFF), a vegetable grower with 30 years experience is also converting 1.1M sq ft greenhouse to potentially produce 75kg/yr via their Pure Sunfarms JV. VFF has a 50% interest and is a quarter or 2 ahead of Pharmhouse. As VFF is getting near production and getting more US exposure (Nasdaq listing), shares have spiked, up over 300% YTD. Based on GMP‚Äôs F20 EBITDA (only 2 brokers cover) forecast of $62M, VFF is trading at ~14.5x EV/EBITDA (note this is only Sunfarms EBITDA and excludes their traditional growing business). This implies an EBITDA margin of  $1.65/g, assuming a full year utilization**.** Also note that Pure Sunfarms recently (April 1) exercised its option to double its production to 150kg (Delta 2)‚Ä¶.this will achieve full run rate by end of 2020. This could also be being priced into the share price, but I would argue most of the stock‚Äôs move was well before this. Given our view that industry supply issues will persist over the near/mid term, the $1.65/g margin assumption seems reasonable, and ultimately, we wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this ends up being conservative. Pharmhouse is significantly undervalued It‚Äôs hard not to recognize the parallels between VFF and Pharmhouse‚Äôs stories‚Ä¶both long time vegetable growers, marketers and distributors that are re-purposing their infrastructure to enter the Cannabis space. If we were to put similar metrics on Pharmhouse‚Äôs facility to what VFF is trading at, this implies potential annual EBITDA of $107M. At a 14.5x multiple, implied EV would be $1.56B, or $7.57/sh of value vs the current $600M or $3.50/sh....and remember, this is just for Pharmhouse. **On a side note, our official Pharmhouse EBITDA forecast is $36M and is based on $1/g and utilization of 50-60%...my analysis here shines a light on the potential upside to numbers as well as a more apples/apples comp to VFF** Pharmhouse deserves a premium to VFF I would further make the argument that between the 2 entities, Pharmhouse should deserve a premium given: ¬∑Future international optionality -  Pharmhouse has 28 affiliated global greenhouse facilities (26.1M sq ft) vs 6 for VFF (9.4M sq ft.). It‚Äôs also worth noting that 13 of the 28 GH‚Äôs are in US states with large, legal cannabis markets while VFF‚Äôs US exposure is limited to Texas which has little/no cannabis mkt. PH has a global non-compete (which means option on any greenhouse their partner wants to convert).

This implies an EBITDA margin of  $1.65/g, assuming a full year utilization**.** Also note that Pure Sunfarms recently (April 1) exercised its option to double its production to 150kg (Delta 2)‚Ä¶.this will achieve full run rate by end of 2020. This could also be being priced into the share price, but I would argue most of the stock‚Äôs move was well before this. Given our view that industry supply issues will persist over the near/mid term, the $1.65/g margin assumption seems reasonable, and ultimately, we wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this ends up being conservative. Pharmhouse is significantly undervalued It‚Äôs hard not to recognize the parallels between VFF and Pharmhouse‚Äôs stories‚Ä¶both long time vegetable growers, marketers and distributors that are re-purposing their infrastructure to enter the Cannabis space. If we were to put similar metrics on Pharmhouse‚Äôs facility to what VFF is trading at, this implies potential annual EBITDA of $107M. At a 14.5x multiple, implied EV would be $1.56B, or $7.57/sh of value vs the current $600M or $3.50/sh....and remember, this is just for Pharmhouse. **On a side note, our official Pharmhouse EBITDA forecast is $36M and is based on $1/g and utilization of 50-60%...my analysis here shines a light on the potential upside to numbers as well as a more apples/apples comp to VFF** Pharmhouse deserves a premium to VFF I would further make the argument that between the 2 entities, Pharmhouse should deserve a premium given: ¬∑Future international optionality -  Pharmhouse has 28 affiliated global greenhouse facilities (26.1M sq ft) vs 6 for VFF (9.4M sq ft.). It‚Äôs also worth noting that 13 of the 28 GH‚Äôs are in US states with large, legal cannabis markets while VFF‚Äôs US exposure is limited to Texas which has little/no cannabis mkt. PH has a global non-compete (which means option on any greenhouse their partner wants to convert). Stronger retail/distribution relationships -  as one of the largest distributors of tomatoes globally, the Family has deep relationships with multinational, retail distribution partners that could be highly beneficial for future international expansion plans.Stronger counterparty relationships ‚Äì 35% of Pharmhouse‚Äôs production facility is supported by offtakes, backstopped by an agreement with Canopy Growth, the largest Cannabis company in the World ($19B mkt cap). This compares to 40% for VFF, backstopped by their partner Emerald Health ($600M mkt cap).See below for a side by side comparison of Pharmhouse and VFF: Sum of Parts ValuationBelow is an illustrative SOTP valuation for RIV assuming VFF multiples for RIV‚Äôs production assets. Represents material upside at a potential 227% return. It should also not be overlooked that this does not provide any upside optionality (which I believe is meaningful) to the private assets, proprietary deal flow, Canopy Growth halo effect, and management savvy/expertise. All of these factors can be had for free at this point. üì∑ Looking at it from a different lens, if we were to deduct various assets from current EV, the current multiple implied for the production assets is 3x EV/EBITDA‚Ä¶arguably below ANYTHING in the cannabis sector in the public markets. üì∑ ConclusionCanopy Rivers is one of the most compelling risk/reward opportunities in the Cannabis space currently. As their Pharmhouse asset gets licensed and ramps up production, I‚Äôd look for a significant re-rate in the stock.",$3.69 CAD,1,0.5,POSITIVE,0.838
