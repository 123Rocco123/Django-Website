,"Today we are looking back at $AMD, a stock we totally missed in June 2016. Sorry. When the stock was at $5 we asked: Is there hope for AMD, long-term? Clearly, yes, with the stock at $13 today. Back then we concluded: In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 88%. That's despite revenues in the March quarter off 19% to $832M. Personally I am at a loss as to why the strong performance. What happened next? At the June quarter AMD stopped going backwards, sales rose single digits. In Sept quarter it was double digit growth. And the stock rose steadily as high as $15 in Feb. So what next? First the basics Ticker AMD Sector Semiconductors Latest price $13.42 Value $12,706M Daily vol $969M Date 04 October 2017 Financials SEC Filings Website http://www.amd.com How's the story changed the last 12 months? From declining sales and losses to double digit growth and profits, there's hardly a nicer turn around! $AMD a year ago today change Price $6.50 $13.40 +115% Target price $6.25 $14.20 +130% Sales forecast $4.4bn $5.0bn +14% EPS forecast $-0.03 $0.10 N/A PE ratio -ve 130x n/a And as with many tech stories, when the top line starts growing at double digit rates, the near term PE valuation looks ludicrous. We'll have to think long term! What's so exciting about AMD? Well, they used to be the also ran in the microprocessor industry. Always chasing Intel. And when it comes to graphics processing units, they were always chasing Nvidia. But substantial R&D over many many years has finally paid off... with a set of products that are starting to gain traction! Though let's not get too excited, Intel and Nvidia are the behemoths in those two markets. And then there is ARM, now owned by Softbank.

How are the numbers looking? As I said above, it's a turnaround story.

And just in case you are wondering about their ability to generate cashflow, well, there is over $500m of net debt on the books, so we shouldn't expect any cashflow to come back to us as dividends in the near future. Cheap, no. Let's look at the figures for 2018, when AMD is expected to earn over 30 cents a share. At 40x earnings it's not a bargin, but if the moment is there, with market share gains and margin gains, it's not a shocking price.

And if we look at sales multiples it's trading on 3x in line with Intel and a substantial discount to NVDA at 13x. So, the valuation doesn't look expensive, given the turn-around. Though clearly it is not a bargain. Watch out for dilution Back in 2016 they issued a convertible. It's way in the money, with owners able to convert their debt at $8 a shares. The further the stock rises the bigger the next dilution to common stock holders. And on top of this they've a strategic investor who dumped stock in August still has a substantial stake.

Despite 4 quarters of double digit growth, their recommendation to clients is Hold. Though we have to remember that Wall Street has been in catch up mode for over 2 years, with a target price below the share price and a hold recommendation all the time. Seems that they, like me, missed the inflection point. Are we too late? Fortune favors the brave. A year ago, you'd have been brave. Today, not so. I can see the potential to double my money within 5 years. If the current trends are sustainable. Though it's no longer a moonshot. If you are a believer in their market position vs Intel and Nvidia, then I can see why you'd be willing to buy. But if you think they are still a me-too chip maker, then best you stay away.

,"Today we are looking back at $AMD, a stock we totally missed in June 2016. Sorry. When the stock was at $5 we asked: Is there hope for AMD, long-term? Clearly, yes, with the stock at $13 today. Back then we concluded: In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 88%. That's despite revenues in the March quarter off 19% to $832M. Personally I am at a loss as to why the strong performance. What happened next? At the June quarter AMD stopped going backwards, sales rose single digits. In Sept quarter it was double digit growth.

And just in case you are wondering about their ability to generate cashflow, well, there is over $500m of net debt on the books, so we shouldn't expect any cashflow to come back to us as dividends in the near future. Cheap, no. Let's look at the figures for 2018, when AMD is expected to earn over 30 cents a share.

And if we look at sales multiples it's trading on 3x in line with Intel and a substantial discount to NVDA at 13x. So, the valuation doesn't look expensive, given the turn-around. Though clearly it is not a bargain. Watch out for dilution Back in 2016 they issued a convertible. It's way in the money, with owners able to convert their debt at $8 a shares.

(Losing only to the NVidia Titan and other high-end compute chips)But guess what? This is still an uphill battle for AMD.Computing is just as much about tooling and programming as it is about hardware. OpenCL works just fine, but NVidia's CUDA tools are considered way better in programming circles, and have reached critical mass with regards to AI fields (TensorFlow, etc. etc.)Video Gamers are saddened by Vega64's relatively weak gaming performance. Video Games don't need GPGPU compute performance: they need Frames per Second. In part, Vega64 is proof of AMD's weaker manufacturing capability. NVidia is able to output both a dedicated Compute Chip (The Titan) and a dedicated Video Gamer chip (the 1080 Ti), but AMD only has the engineering prowess to pick one.I think I agree with AMD's long term strategy here. Video Gamers are a secondary market compared to the growing GPGPU community, and generally speaking a good Compute Chip will still be a decent Video Gaming chip. GPGPU compute is just way more profitable than video games. Professionals are willing to pay $3000+ per GPU, while even the most hardcore of Video Gamers really only pay up to $800 or so (with most Video Gamers opting for the $200 price point)The next steps would be for AMD to release better tools to try and catch up to NVidia's strong lead with CUDA / Tensorflow / etc. etc. Vega64 has proven that it can go toe-to-toe in Compute, but without tooling it'd be difficult for AMD to thrive.A key development over the past year is Apple choosing AMD / OpenCL to be the GPGPU solution of the ""Mac Pro"" line. This isn't surprising, because Apple did create OpenCL after all (and AMD hopped on board later).Still, if AMD can be a good 2nd place contender in GPGPU compute, I think they'd be in a good position. Plenty of markets are big enough for two companies: Pepsi and Coke... Yahoo and Gmail... Bing and Google.We usually look down upon the underdog from an investing perspective, but its still potentially profitable.Bulldozer wasn't that bad in the great scheme of things, but Intel really blew AMD out of the water with the release of ""Sandy Bridge"" chips. AMD had virtually no response for years, but now Intel has stopped innovating (years of only single-digit performance gains), finally giving AMD an opportunity to leap-frog a competitive product.RyZEN doesn't seem to be ""superior"" to Intel, but its a strong contender and the price is way cheaper than Intel. Between EPYC ($2000+ market), Threadripper ($500+ market), and RyZEN ($300ish market), AMD has positioned itself as a cheaper alternative to Intel. And its not really much worse than Intel's chips at all.Intel still will have the laptop market on lockdown, because RyZEN doesn't have the power efficiency that Intel's chips have. But in server / workstation / desktop, AMD has made a serious contender.",0,0.552,NEGATIVE,0.999

It compromised single threaded IPC for a weird kind of multithreading that wasn't well supported by operating systems throughout most of its life. I wouldn't characterize Intel as not innovating so much as having a ton of trouble getting their 10nm node off the ground which has heavily limited exactly how far they can increase IPC. I mean yeah Ryzen does have a pretty impressive IPC improvement over Bulldozer but that's more a symptom of Bulldozer sucking in the first place than AMD being amazing. Kind of like how China could grow GDP at over 7% for years since a large part of that was just basic industrialization. Things always get harder when you approach the horizon and now that AMD has more or less 'caught up' they're going to be face similar constraints. Intel has also been focused more on making their processor perform extremely well for poorly threaded workloads. Dynamic overclocking and significantly higher clock rates than most AMD parts without a massive pipeline are part of what put them ahead of previous generation AMD chips so handily.AMD is clearly still focused on multithread and multicore approaches but doing it in a lot more sane manner at this point by focusing on full fledged cores with good IPC on MCMs versus the CMT model Bulldozer both lived and died by.I think the tooling commentary is on point as well. NVIDIA is light years ahead here, but the one thing that AMD does potentially have backing it up is that a lot of the actual task specific APIs could get an OpenCL backend that's pretty much transparent to the developer utilizing them. Getting an OpenCL backend for something like TensorFlow or PyTorch would be huge for them. NVIDIA seems to already be moving towards hybridizing their GPGPUs even further with special tensor units while AMD just caught up with half precision floating point implementations. NVIDIA is also making a bigger push into the embedded auto space with the Drive PX platform and existing Tegra line. The market is definitely big enough to accommodate two players but I think the question with AMD is if they're going to ever get to the point where they can demand the same kind of price premiums or if they're constantly going to be slightly behind the curve but significantly cheaper.",1,0.538,NEGATIVE,1.0

Peers Valuation Forecast PE Long-term Growth Dividend Yield FCF Yield AMD.O $12,706M 40x N/A 0% N/A Peers INTC.O $185,047M 13x 9% 3% 13% NVDA.O $107,622M 45x 12% 0% 2% Other Semis TSM $189,812M 18x 15% 3% 13% AVGO.O $97,711M 15x 18% 2% 6% TXN.O $89,044M 22x 10% 2% 8% MU.O $44,975M 5x N/A 0% 0% If we do our standard back-of-the-envelope, assuming earnings go up 20 cents a year, i.e. $0.10 ,$0.30, $0.50... for 30 years and discount it as 8% then the net present value is worth over $20 a share. And if we look at sales multiples it's trading on 3x in line with Intel and a substantial discount to NVDA at 13x. So, the valuation doesn't look expensive, given the turn-around. Though clearly it is not a bargain. Watch out for dilution Back in 2016 they issued a convertible. It's way in the money, with owners able to convert their debt at $8 a shares. The further the stock rises the bigger the next dilution to common stock holders. And on top of this they've a strategic investor who dumped stock in August still has a substantial stake. So there is a headwind here, as these folks sell down. Wall Street doesn't care The professionals on Wall Street have a $14.23 for AMD, i.e. a paltry 6% upside. Despite 4 quarters of double digit growth, their recommendation to clients is Hold. Though we have to remember that Wall Street has been in catch up mode for over 2 years, with a target price below the share price and a hold recommendation all the time. Seems that they, like me, missed the inflection point. Are we too late? Fortune favors the brave. A year ago, you'd have been brave. Today, not so. I can see the potential to double my money within 5 years. If the current trends are sustainable. Though it's no longer a moonshot. If you are a believer in their market position vs Intel and Nvidia, then I can see why you'd be willing to buy. But if you think they are still a me-too chip maker, then best you stay away. Like a year ago, I'm stuck on the fence. I just don't understand the tech well enough to make that call. Sorry. View the archive of Stock a Day posts at it's subreddit stockaday.

,"Today we are looking back at $AMD, a stock we totally missed in June 2016. Sorry. When the stock was at $5 we asked: Is there hope for AMD, long-term? Clearly, yes, with the stock at $13 today. Back then we concluded: In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 88%. That's despite revenues in the March quarter off 19% to $832M. Personally I am at a loss as to why the strong performance. What happened next? At the June quarter AMD stopped going backwards, sales rose single digits. In Sept quarter it was double digit growth. And the stock rose steadily as high as $15 in Feb. So what next? First the basics Ticker AMD Sector Semiconductors Latest price $13.42 Value $12,706M Daily vol $969M Date 04 October 2017 Financials SEC Filings Website http://www.amd.com How's the story changed the last 12 months? From declining sales and losses to double digit growth and profits, there's hardly a nicer turn around! $AMD a year ago today change Price $6.50 $13.40 +115% Target price $6.25 $14.20 +130% Sales forecast $4.4bn $5.0bn +14% EPS forecast $-0.03 $0.10 N/A PE ratio -ve 130x n/a And as with many tech stories, when the top line starts growing at double digit rates, the near term PE valuation looks ludicrous. We'll have to think long term! What's so exciting about AMD? Well, they used to be the also ran in the microprocessor industry. Always chasing Intel. And when it comes to graphics processing units, they were always chasing Nvidia. But substantial R&D over many many years has finally paid off... with a set of products that are starting to gain traction! Though let's not get too excited, Intel and Nvidia are the behemoths in those two markets. And then there is ARM, now owned by Softbank. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. $4,619M -ve -ve Intel Corporation $61,711M 40% 20% NVIDIA Corporation $8,344M 34% 44% So they are still the challenger even though the stock price has surged! How are the numbers looking? As I said above, it's a turnaround story. Metric 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A 2017E 2018E Revenue $5.4bn $5.3bn $5.5bn $4.0bn $4.3bn $5.0bn $5.7bn EPS $-1.60 $-0.11 $-0.53 $-0.84 $-0.60 $0.10 $0.31 The expectation is they can add $700m a year to the topline with some nice operational leverage. And just in case you are wondering about their ability to generate cashflow, well, there is over $500m of net debt on the books, so we shouldn't expect any cashflow to come back to us as dividends in the near future.
