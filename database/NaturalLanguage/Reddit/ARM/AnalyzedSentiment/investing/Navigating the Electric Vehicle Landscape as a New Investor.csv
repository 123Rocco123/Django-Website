,"Hey fellow investors! I'm a relatively new investor, particularly focussing on long term investments. I spent most of 2023 learning the ropes of valuing companies and now I'm eager to explore a specific industry. Lately, I've been drawn to the electric vehicle (EV) sector. While it's tempting to dream of picking the next Tesla, I'm mindful that savvy investors often analyze historical data, seeking common trends that make sense as the sector matures. This includes looking at the miners of essential metals, as well as the hardware and technology necessary for battery production. To the seasoned investors out there, armed with your current knowledge, what advice would you share with your past selves when initially venturing into this space? Where should one start, and what pitfalls should be avoided?",my advice if youre a new investor is to navigate very far away from anything EV and just park your money in index funds and find a more interesting hobby.,0,0.531,NEGATIVE,0.999

Where should one start, and what pitfalls should be avoided?","The auto sector is capital-intensive. Pretty much any EV company that can't scale and grow fast enough to be profitable before they go bankrupt is at serious risk.The legacy OEM's can survive for quite some time because they have a piggybank and branding behind them as well as ICE vehicles still being in-demand. But most likely you will see companies from China eat into their market share because of how dominant China's EV market is. We are already seeing that with China in regards to Volkswagen, who generate around 50% of their profit in China but every year, sales plummet in China because China's relying on domestic EV makers instead of buying Volkswagen.There are those who think EV's are still a fad. It's not. Any automaker, outside of exotic luxury vehicle brands such as Rolls or Ferrari, will be in trouble if they don't innovate into EV's. Hybrids are a good medium to transition into EV's until the infrastructure is available but it's not going to outperform EV's in the long term, especially when EV technology continues to improve and the infrastructure is available. But for now, yeah, hybrids are a pretty good option for those worried about a lack of charging. By 2030, EV's will sell more than ICE vehicles.You'll see lots of money being pumped into EV stocks right now because everyone is trying to get in to try and get the next Tesla or dominant player in this space. It's not going to be the legacy OEM's because they're not transitioning fast enough so that's why most of the new money being invested into the auto sector is going towards Chinese EV companies, LUCID, and Rivian.My take is EV is a very risky space right now. Most of the 'gains' you are looking for have already been made so unless you're willing to sit in the sidelines for a longer term outlook, I'd park my money elsewhere. The interesting part about EV's is it basically rejuvenated the auto sector stocks. No one really cared about the autosector before Tesla came in and stole all the attention. Traditionally, it was always boring.",0,0.536,NEGATIVE,0.996

I scrutinized both bull and bear perspectives and the bear perspectives were SEVERELY outweighed by the bull case. Key thing here is perspectives and objectively scrutinizing both of them.-Controversy is where the most money is made; as I mentioned, TSLA was major battleground stock from 2016-2019, then, shorts got crushed once the factories started cranking. It's very very hard to hold your conviction when the stock is tanking and it's being heavily shorted and criticized.Which leads me to the most important things if you are going to be successful if you find the ""next TSLA"":CONVICTION- When I was staring at gains equivalent of buying a new house after less than 1 year of investment, everyone said to sell/hedge and sell covered calls and roll if the stock continues to go up. This was a mistake; I probably chewed up roughly $250k in gains from this strategy. Good news is that I held the stock until the $1T valuation and at that point I knew it had reached its peak for a while and got out. Think about it this way: say you invested in AMZN before 2000 and it crashed-- do you hold and buy more or cut and run? There will be MAJOR volatility for stocks that achieve outrageous returns-- do you have the discipline and conviction to hold through the hard times and not to sell too early? Again, AMZN would have taken roughly 5 years to double from 2000-2005 and many would have taken their gains, if they didn't, well, they wouldve seen 20x gains over the next 5 years. So, if it's going well can you hold until maturation? If it's going poorly can you hold until the tides turn?What am I in now that seems to suit this criteria? Public: Quantumscape (QS) They finally had a major public catalyst released today and someone above wrote about solid state battery hype, well guess what, it's definitely not hype anymore. Manufacturing and scaling are the only obstacles for QS now-- tech is unequivocally superior and is likely cheaper or parity to manufacture at scale.Major battleground stock with tons of volatility ✅️VW desperately needs an EV win ✅️Deep established associations and ties (JB Straubel) ✅️QS finally named and validated by VWOne that I like, am in, is currently private, but isn't as controversial and could be a MASSIVE behemoth: Redwood Materials.",0,0.534,POSITIVE,0.791

You want lithium miners/processors that are already mature and are already producing, not ones that may or may not ramp up over the next 5 or 10 years.TSLA is the only auto maker serious about EVs in the West. Other Western auto makers have massively mismanaged their future prospect and have basically handed Tesla a monopoly. Chinese EV makers may end up doing well, but I still find Chinese stocks uninvestable due to government interference.My picks are ALB, LTHM, and TSLA.

That could get messy. I'm not sure there's a graceful to do that. IMO Any ""restructuring cost"" would be significant.If the EV adoption doesn't go to plan, they'll have to figure out how to continue supporting both ICE and EV sides of the business.
