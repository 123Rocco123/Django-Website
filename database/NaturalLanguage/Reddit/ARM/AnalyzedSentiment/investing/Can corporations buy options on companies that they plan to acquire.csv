,"See title. Softbank is planning to sell ARM holdings to Nvidia, while they appear to be actively trading Nvidia options. Isn't there some kind of regulation against this? Corporation A could buy a bunch of deep OTM calls on company B, then announce that A is buying B, allowing A to buy B for pennies on the dollar. Or even more nefarious, company A can buy calls on B, announce an acquisition, dump the calls and buy puts, then call off the deal to double dip the pump and dump.","Berkshire sold naked puts on BNSF back when it was still a publicly traded company.Many of the puts ended up going into the money by a few dollars and Berkshire ended up with the shares.In the end, Berkshire bought all the shares and took BNSF private, I'm assuming selling the puts was a way of Buffet having some fun and pocketing some premium.https://www.gurufocus.com/news/36577/warren-buffett-sells-put-option-on-burlington-northern-santa-fe-berkshire-hathaway-filing-revealsPublicly, Buffett often laments the use of options, describing them as ""Weapons of Mass Destruction,"" despite him telling the public that, Berkshire is often very active in the options markets.",0,0.528,NEGATIVE,1.0

If it was, no large investor (mutual funds, hedge funds, etc) could ever trade anything, since their trades are large enough to be market moving, and so knowledge of their intention to trade is material.If individual employees of Softbank were trading in their personal accounts, based on their knowledge of the deal, that would be insider trading. The key idea is that there is an expectation or duty of trust/confidentiality here. An employee would be misappropriating information belonging to their employer for personal gain.As Matt Levine so often and succinctly puts it in his columns, insider trading (at least in the US) is not about fairness, it is about theft of IP.",0,0.529,NEGATIVE,1.0

If I know someone from another company, and they tell me something, I cannot use it for financial gain.

They know their purchases will likely move markets while having a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders to be cost efficient. That would seem like insider trading, but it happens all the time. Just like all the bond action that occurs before the Fed starts a liquidity injection. The only people that get nailed for insider trader—a rare event—are those who don’t have enough political connections.",0,0.525,NEGATIVE,0.889
