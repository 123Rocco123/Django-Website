We are in a market where: Fed is tightening monetary policy and will do so for the near future S&P and Dow are overvalued Shiller PE is 29 vs median of 16 Regular S&P PE is 20 vs median of 15 (and Dow is 22) S&P Price to Sales is 2.4 vs median of 1.5 Borrowing rates are nearly guaranteed to increase and negatively impact valuations Both indexes are faced with a potential 25%+ decrease (or years of sideways price movement) before hitting median historical valuations Bonds are paying very little or even negative real returns and subject to inflationary risk Commercial, retail, and residential real estate are hard to predict due to disruptions from telework & COVID, with valuations potentially readjusting due to shifts in demand and headwinds from the end of cheap borrowing Commodities are volatile due to disrupted supply chains, inflation, and conflicts like Russia/Ukraine Cash would be king if you were willing to bet on inflation being tamer in the future, but my arm-chair QB call is that this is unlikely Given all of these asset classes face some major challenge, broadly investing in them passively has some risks.

If it is more attractive, what price would you pay? -- mine is around 265 for the B-shares but your risk appetite may vary. If you feel an alternative (like the Dow or the S&P) are better investments -- why? How are they better positioned and what upside would they offer? EDIT: For those wondering about how I arrived at $265. It was nothing fancy or sophisticated.

Source for BVPS: https://roic.ai/company/BRK-B BTW, some more interesting analysis: BRK has had a CAGR of 10% - 11% on their BVPS since 2006 -- Not too shabby for a managed mutual fund with bond like safety BRK was trading at a low of $70 in Jan 2007 -- but it was also a very rich 1.5x BVPS Compound $70 at 10% to Jan 2023 and we have $322, or what I would consider the upper limit for the fair value of BRK There are many ways to arrive at fair value. I do not aim to be precise but relatively accurate within a band/tolerance.","Well, BRK-B at 317 right now is wildly overvalued based on your target of 265, so I don't feel it's fair for you to say BRK is your choice because SPY is overvalued. I also think that the claim that SPY is facing a ""25% decline"" to be doubtful (although, of course, possible), what are the assumptions and evidence that you are using to get to that conclusion?I also disagree BRK has ""bond like safety"". Drawdown of 45% in 2008, and 24% in 2022.FWIW, I agree that BRK at a P/B of 1.2 is definitely where I'd buy, since I think that's where WB said they'd buy. Around 5% of my portfolio is BRK, but at current prices I'm not looking to add. I'll re-evaluate when 2022 report is out with the new book value.",0,0.551,NEGATIVE,1.0

The stock was at the 265 range in October and has climbed nearly 20% since then. I've watched it for years and it can bounce around, especially in times of volatility so it pays to keep an eye on it and buy when it's a bargain. And my comparison to a bond is in terms of the predictability of their income and earnings (at least pre-mark to market) and the general stability of their businesses. Lastly, since 2006, BKR has grown book value by a 10% CAGR while the S&P 500 has only grown by 4.4%.

EDIT: For those wondering about how I arrived at $265. It was nothing fancy or sophisticated. I averaged the book value per share (BVPS) for 2021 and TTM and multiplied it by 1.2 ---- (223.46 + 217.63) / 2 * 1.2 = ~265. Source for BVPS: https://roic.ai/company/BRK-B BTW, some more interesting analysis: BRK has had a CAGR of 10% - 11% on their BVPS since 2006 -- Not too shabby for a managed mutual fund with bond like safety BRK was trading at a low of $70 in Jan 2007 -- but it was also a very rich 1.5x BVPS Compound $70 at 10% to Jan 2023 and we have $322, or what I would consider the upper limit for the fair value of BRK There are many ways to arrive at fair value. I do not aim to be precise but relatively accurate within a band/tolerance.","I actually linked that in my comment. from 1965-2021, 20.1% compounded annual returns vs 10.5% for the S&P. Cumulative that is 3,641,613%(BRK) vs 30,209%(S&P). I agree that picking time frames to dispute performance is dumb especially when you try to do it against Berkshire because you REALLY have to cherry pick. The ironic thing is that if the Berkshire stock was higher(all other things held equal), it would have more outperformance and would cause more people to want to buy it with that reasoning, but it would be an objectively worse investment because it would make it more expensive, thus lowering your future returns.",5,0.526,NEGATIVE,1.0
