,"Key Stats for Vista Outdoor Inc 10 days to the US election, wish you'd gone fishing? Well if you can't how about about hedging your bets with an Outdoor + Firearm stock! Ticker VSTO Sector Recreational Products Latest price $38.88 Value $2,346M Daily vol $15M Date 28 October 2016 Useful Links Latest news from Yahoo Finance Latest results from SEC Edgar Website: http://vistaoutdoor.com/ Description Vista Outdoor Inc. is a designer, manufacturer and marketer of consumer products in the outdoor sports and recreation markets. The Company operates through two segments: Shooting Sports and Outdoor Products. It serves a range of end consumers, including outdoor enthusiasts, hunters and recreational shooters, athletes, as well as law enforcement and military professionals. Its Shooting Sports segment (62% of sales) designs, develops, produces and sources ammunition and firearms for the hunting and sport shooting enthusiast markets, as well as ammunition for local law enforcement, the United States Government and international markets. Its Outdoor Products (38% of sales) segment product lines include archery/hunting accessories, global eyewear and sport protection, golf, hydration products, optics, shooting accessories, tactical products and water sports. Recent financials On the face of it, growth looks good, but that's been driven by major acquisitions. For example they spent $460m in the March year end 2016 to buy CamelBak and Jimmy Styks. That aside, there's been a steady increase in margin. So seems like management's doing a reasonably job adding to its stable of brands. March year-end 2016A 2015A 2014A 2013A 2012A Revenue $2.3bn $2.1bn $1.9bn $1.2bn $1.0bn Operating margin 12% 9% 13% 9% 3% EPS $2.35 $1.25 $2.09 $1.01 $0.17 But where they've done well on acquisitions, the stock took a hit in the June quarter, with results failing to impress. Why? Here's the commentary from the call with analysts: Our performance last quarter was also impacted by shooting sports consumers who shifted their spending to certain firearm platforms outside our firearms offering, primarily modern sporting rifles and handguns, and to certain ammunition products where we are currently capacity constrained, primarily 9 millimeter for handguns and 5.56 and .223 ammunition that support the major platforms in modern sporting rifles. We believe the shift in consumer share of wallet impacted sales of our optics and shooting accessories. We were also impacted by recent inventory liquidations from the outdoor retailer bankruptcies that weâ€™ve seen and the timing of certain international orders that we have now seen slip to later in our year. So a perfect storm. Competition When they talk about the competition in the annual report they say: Significant competitors in the outdoor sporting market include Amer Sports, Jarden, Johnson Outdoors, and Thule Group. Significant accessories competitors include major optics companies Luxottica Group and Nikon and hydration system competitors including Bubba, Contigo, and Nalgene. Significant ammunition competitors include Remington Arms, Winchester Ammunition of Olin Corporation and various smaller manufacturers and importers, including Black Hills Ammunition, CBC Group, Fiocchi Ammunition, Hornady, PMC, Rio Ammunition and Wolf. Significant firearms competitors include Mossberg, Marlin, Ruger, Remington Arms, Smith and Wesson and Winchester. Looking at the figures, margins are fine compared to the other Outdoors players, but nothing like that of the firearms guys.

No. The sales growth was driven by acquisitions, and the quarter actually contained a profit warning. :( On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, they gave a lot of color to the profit warning.

IF theyre at capacity and posted .48 last quarter, to meet their target of .61 for q3, im thinking their sports side would need to have had one hell of a summer. Some of the brands they picked are really good, but I'm not seeing how they can meet projections when 38% of the company needs to have more than doubled if we assume 0% growth in their majority sector, ammunitions. They sell that much golf equipment now that nike left? I'm exiting my position at avg cost 38.90. Thanks for the post.",0,0.558,NEGATIVE,0.999

It's worse than I thought. Their outdoor segment has grown twice as fast as their shooting segment and account for 48% of revenue in q2. Again, assuming they maxed out their potential shooting segment, their outdoor segment would need very little growth to obtain the same EPS as last quarter (which would still miss the projected .61); however, when looking at other outdoor retailers like Columbia (COLM) and Cabela's (CAB), both had Q3 earnings misses. SOOOOO the minority segment that has nearly an equal share of revenue needs to double when competitors posted Q3 losses. PLUS their revenue from outdoor is inflated from their acquisitions meaning it's not even real revenue at this point. I have no idea what I'm talking abut because 7 different analysts have this stock hitting mid-40s by eoy, the last 3 months have had a flury of insider purchases and increased positions by institutional owners. PLUS COLM is up and CAB has good guidance. I'm not selling my position as the whole sector looks to have a good future. idk",1,0.538,NEGATIVE,1.0

Significant ammunition competitors include Remington Arms, Winchester Ammunition of Olin Corporation and various smaller manufacturers and importers, including Black Hills Ammunition, CBC Group, Fiocchi Ammunition, Hornady, PMC, Rio Ammunition and Wolf. Significant firearms competitors include Mossberg, Marlin, Ruger, Remington Arms, Smith and Wesson and Winchester. Looking at the figures, margins are fine compared to the other Outdoors players, but nothing like that of the firearms guys. Companies Latest Sales Operating Profit Return on Equity Vista Outdoor Inc $2,387M 14% 9% Johnson Outdoors Inc. $444M 10% 8% Olin Corporation $4,513M 15% -6% Sturm Ruger & Company Inc $614M 25% 33% Smith & Wesson Holding Corp $782M 28% 41% Cash / Debt? Vista Outdoor Inc has $992M of net debt. That is 2.9x it's latest operating profit. I usually get edgy when it's over 3x. Wall Street thinks? The professionals on Wall Street have a $51.63 for Vista Outdoor Inc and their recommendation to clients is Buy. That implies an upside of 33% to their target. Valuation Clearly it's not expensive though we can see it's not like this is a high PE sector. Plus there's scant dividends in sight.

I wonder if consensus is being mis calculated. Have asked Reuters to correct. Especially since the annual says: We have not paid, and do not currently expect to pay, dividends on our common stock. Catalysts In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -22% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -5%. So the PE ratio's come in to 15x from 18x. That's against a backdrop on sales up 20% in the last 3 months. Strange? No. The sales growth was driven by acquisitions, and the quarter actually contained a profit warning. :( On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, they gave a lot of color to the profit warning. But effectively the Shooting business is flat and the Outdoor business declined at a double digit rate, excluding acquisitions. So you could say that confidence in management's guidance is shot. Either that or part of the business is in trouble. If it's a confidence think, then I'm not worried. In fact means we've got a nice buying opportunity. But if the Outdoor business is trading badly... then I don't see where the good news comes from. Which is it? View the archive of Stock a Day posts at its subreddit r/stockaday.
