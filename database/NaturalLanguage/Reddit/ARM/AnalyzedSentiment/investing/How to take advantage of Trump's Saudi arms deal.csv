,Buy Raytheon and Lockheed? I'm very new to investing so don't really know how best to take advantage of this or is too late? Any thoughts/discussion appreciated.,Already priced in. Most of the deal was negoiated by the Obama administration over the last two years. You don't just ink this kind of arms deal in a month. When you sell weapons technology particularlly to Arab nations you have to make sure that Isreal can potentially defend against it (its the reason we don't for example sell advanced fighter jets to the Saudis but we do to Isreal),0,0.529,NEGATIVE,1.0

,Buy Raytheon and Lockheed? I'm very new to investing so don't really know how best to take advantage of this or is too late? Any thoughts/discussion appreciated.,"An ETF is basically an index, it's usually dozens of companies - so you're more diversified. In case, you put all your 5k on 1 stock, something bad happens to that company, it's share price will go down and you'll start panicking. However, if something happened bad happened to a company that's listed in that ETF, it won't impact the share price much because it might only make up a couple % of the total allocation, there are so many companies in it. Basically diversification, in those ETFS, all the major companies in the defense industry are in it and allocated accordingly by the manager of the ETF. Since you're new, it might be tough for you to keep up with 1 stock and follow what it's doing, an ETF makes your life easier because you're betting on the WHOLE sector because the ETF consists of dozens of companies in it.",3,0.56,POSITIVE,0.815

,Buy Raytheon and Lockheed? I'm very new to investing so don't really know how best to take advantage of this or is too late? Any thoughts/discussion appreciated.,"Not sure what you're asking? Are you talking about the holdings (companies) inside the ETF? The companies inside the ETFs that I listed are exclusively in the defense sector(military contractors); IVV and SPY track the S&P 500 index, which means the 500 biggest companies ranging from Tech, healthcare, industrials etc. So, no the ETFs I listed are very different compared to IVV and SPY.",2,0.52,NEGATIVE,0.998
