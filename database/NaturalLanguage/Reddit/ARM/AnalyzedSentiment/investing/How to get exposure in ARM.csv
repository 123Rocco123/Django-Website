,"Hey folks, How might one go about getting exposure to ARM as a technology? Everybody is talking about AMD (and they're doing an amazing job) but I believe because of the power efficiency of ARM it's going to become more widely popular.",I believe you may have held or mentioned Softbank the past. It has some attractive assets but also some dumpers like WeWork and Uber investments. Have you exited this position due to those moves?,1,0.524,NEGATIVE,0.992

Everybody is talking about AMD (and they're doing an amazing job) but I believe because of the power efficiency of ARM it's going to become more widely popular.","I haven't owned it in a while. I think there's some appeal to following Masa Son's lunacy a little bit, but I really didn't understand the appeal or path to profitability of ride sharing and WeWork was both problematic from a corporate governance standpoint and the fact that the business model wasn't anything new but was presented as a ""tech"" company. Investing in Uber has also been a considerable loser for Paypal.There are interesting investments in the Vision Fund that are never talked about, such as Guardant Health (GH.) Unfortunately, the problems are either big and serious (Uber, WeWork) or small and ridiculous (Wag.) I'm not sure if the fund still has a stake in IRBT, but that hasn't gone well either. Masa Son apologized a couple of months ago so will be interesting to see if Vision Fund 2 changes anything.",2,0.536,NEGATIVE,1.0
