A huge portion of the earnings disappointments have been resultant from large drops from overseas revenues. Eventually this stuff will trickle into the US economy more succinctly similar to what we saw in late 2015 / early 2016.Italy is in a recession right now. France, Germany, and the rest of the eurozone are on the brink of being in a recession. Yet the only discussion seen anywhere is stuff about Trump or the trade war.",1,0.516,NEGATIVE,0.67

Given, in the past, the USA has been able to shrug off some other parts of the world slowing down and experiencing problems, but the world is far more global now, and there is also a considerably bigger amount of the global economy that is slowing down precipitously. This time around, it's not ""other parts""... it's literally the entire global economy.The old adage has always been that if the USA sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold. Well right now, it's kind of the opposite, which explains the lag in economic data coming through. With that said, given the scale of the slowdown around the globe and the basic fact that the USA is facing tougher domestic headwinds going forward with really tough YOY earnings comps, and you get a recipe for ""the usa catching a cold"" from the rest of the world here. To my point that a lot of domestic investors are being really naive here, I think they're assuming that stuff outside USA's borders won't come back to affect us, but there is no real reason it wouldn't. Even in 2015-2016, we saw that what happens outside our borders can strongly affect our domestic economy.Then beyond that, you get a lot of feedback loops that can kick in to the downside if things slowdown too much and if we don't get a record global wave of stimulus like we got in 2016. Either we get record stimulus, or this global slowdown will continue, and likely accelerate, regardless of what happens in the trade war.",3,0.529,NEGATIVE,0.993
