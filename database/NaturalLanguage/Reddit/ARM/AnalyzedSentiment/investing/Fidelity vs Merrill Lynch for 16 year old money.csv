I donâ€™t think the pros and cons you listed are the ones you should be concerned with, rather you should be more concerned about cost and how friendly the broker is to smaller accounts. Merrill seems to be more focused on larger accounts whereas Schwab (and I suspect Fidelity) are more friendly to smaller investors.Both Merrill and brokers like Fidelity and Schwab now have similar costs so that isnâ€™t much of a difference.",0,0.508,NEGATIVE,0.957
