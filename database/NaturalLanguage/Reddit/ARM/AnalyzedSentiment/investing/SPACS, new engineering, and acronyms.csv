I am sick of private equity sucking all the growth curve out of companies and then bringing them public at a 60x to revenue valuation. That trend of the past 10yrs or so has been one of the most damaging trends for retail investors.Yes, buying SPACs before confirmation is a gamble. Historically they have done poorly after consummation. CLOV, for example, seems to be following that path. But CLOV and many others I will be very interested in after they have established a couple quarters of earnings and we get clarity and consistency on fundamentals. If we get a great SPAC collapse there will be excellent stock picking opportunities for those willing to do their DD. jmtc",0,0.527,POSITIVE,0.932

Leveraged buyouts paid with debt that ends up on the companys books, consulting fees, and almost no organizational investment.However, most**, of these transactions are not framed as alternatives to PE. They are marketed in the IB community as alternatives to IPOs. Though PE firms do bring aquired firms back to marker on occassion, I dont see the volume of these transactions having any resemblance to PE transactions.As a side note, I think we are on the same page with respect to shareholder value not being held hostage by debt, fees, and BS engineering...but the article referenced indicated new forms of spacs had to be created because that is exactly what they have been doing with high returns to a very specific few, then dilution to the shareholders.Thanks for the reply and discussion.

However, I think these SPACS are not the solution to that problem, these companies are not of the quality that PE has access to and I suspect the better quality private companies will not be shared with the public vis-à-vis SPAC, there is no incentive to do. Currently, SPAC sponsers get an approximate 956% return on their ""investment"" as sponser shares are given out like free candy. SPACs seem to be a quick way for the richer to get richer at this point, atleast per the data.",1,0.522,NEGATIVE,1.0

I thought it would be profitbale also(not sure).Trust me I am a big shot is leading to what we are faced with now. Over 132 stocks going ipo in 2021 so far. Very few if any after ipo will get better price either. They are mostly based on a concept not proven get rushed into ipo taking gain and run.The more I look at companies like Social Capital Hedosophia the sicker I feel about Spacs. Look at Clover Health. It lost -50% lost 100Ms every year....Here are are some news.,1,0.558,NEGATIVE,1.0

I think that at some point folks are going to want companies with real paths to profitability, and not some ambiguous plan that may or may not be accomplished. I also have to believe that there’s only so much capital that can go around and with the constant flood of SPACs, it’s going to be hard for everyone to emerge a winner.",2,0.532,NEGATIVE,0.996

In all honesty, I feel very uncomfortable with some companies in Iceland or Asia that claim they are the global leader etc. Right now even eV companies actually are shipping vehicles are very affordable. Assuming there are 900 more merges this year, some suggest delay purchase until a DA or voting. I even find that is somewhat challenging as the list is too long already. Those suggest to baghold a pre-ipo for 2 years probably wish they never tied up that much money and will liquidate for other play. Another thing happended last week most warrants have tanked about -30 to 40% than week prior. This is another redflag. All happened after CCIV price correction time.",3,0.536,NEGATIVE,1.0
