,"Fellow redditors, I like looking at blue chip companies in trouble and presented TEVA on this subreddit (here, update here). In my last post I mentioned that Bayer (BAYRY) has some similarities and there were some requests for insights into the company. Both companies are well known and respected in the pharmaceutical sector (my professional field) and overpaid for acquisitions that gained them a lot of debt and lawsuits. Bayer acquired Monsanto in 2018 for about 63 Billion USD and currently has a market cap of around 50B USD (less than half that of 2017). The company is made up of a crop science and a pharmaceutical arm, with some calling for the two to be split. While lawsuits are routine in both sectors and can get very ugly, the ones around glyphosate had gained an almost political level due to the cumulative hate directed at Monsanto. Monsanto was known to be cynically „ultracapitalist“ in their dealings and became a lightning rod of sorts. The takeover by Bayer with its de-facto rebranding did little to mitigate this. Fittingly enough, selling Monsanto was the cherry on the cake of cynical dealings. Since tables are messy to present in a post, I prefer just linking the sources this time: Q3/2022 Report, 2021 Report, 2020 Report. The acquisition did gain Bayer a ""complete"" cropsciences portfolio and some synergies, but the bad overshadowed the good. Net Debt went from 3.6 B EUR in 2017 to about 36 B EUR currently. Sales did rise from mid-30 to mid-40 B EUR, but the -13B EUR from „Litigations/Legal Risks“ in 2020 needs digesting. Bayer did not stop paying dividends, but is reasonably quite conservative in the amounts paid out (about a third of core earnings per share, 2.0 EUR for 2021). Overall I do not think that Bayer leadership handled the acquisition fallout particularly well, showing little dynamism. However, its current market capitalization is close to the bare bones. With continuing strong sales in two essential businesses, any value investor should pay attention. Debt management will need some consideration and many will steer clear for as long as lawsuits make headlines. That being said, Bayer represent the biggest allocation for individual stocks in my portfolio, so I’m personally quite confident in its future. Again, I wish you happy holidays and good luck with your investments!","This appears to be a DD submission. Please note that we expect such posts to meet a higher standard of analysis.

They’re fighting against the tide on a lot of fronts, they still have poor leadership, and competitors seem to still manage to innovate while Bayer are still trying to keep their shit together.On the Crop Science front, Corteva is a more solid investment. New CEO came in a year ago now and is consolidation their commercial and research presence, as well as aggressive restructuring for increased profitability.On the Pharma front, I know less, but would assume that there are better options out there that don’t have a risky business bolted onto the side of them.",0,0.537,NEGATIVE,1.0

From the crop science side the main risk would be more restriction on dicamba applications on xtend beans. The trait sales are a moneymaker. The Enlist trait is taking large market share gains in my area. In terms of crop science I’d rather own Corteva. But they both should have a pretty good year with high crop prices and they have raised prices on crop protection and seed.Edit. Bayers retail seed business is the flagship brand and the private dealer brand is kind of secondary. Corteva’s private dealer brand is their flagship and retail is secondary. I think this is a better strategy as retailers usually sell multiple brands and probably don’t drive sales as good as good as a private sales agency. High turnover and consolidation has hurt retail seed sellers imo.,0,0.546,NEGATIVE,1.0

Side note, these stupid screeners include (exclusively) cannabis companies in ""Pharma manufacturing""; small PITA to sort that.Anyway, I noted huge discrepancies. I am not sure if some of these, like Bayer, are underpriced or if some, like Pfizer, are overpriced.What I can say is that basketing pharmaceuticals doesnt make a lot of sense because of how different the individual products are. The reason I mentioned the cannabis thing is to exemplify that. In many other industries products are somewhat comparable in how customers interact with the finished good; for instance a passenger car moves people. With Pharma every drug has a discrete purpose and even with a portfolio of drugs each product's accessible market is usually pretty small....except in the case of things like OTC analgesics which are cornered and low margin.It seems like acquisition is the flavor of diversification in Pharma. This is usually with the goal of accessing larger and more constant customer demand. With that in mind the Bayer-Monsanto deal makes sense on paper in lieu of the debt. Some of the assets (chemical manufacturing) are even potentially cross functional. It's certainly risky, as Monsanto's portfolio is definitely not a public relations machine.I think Bayer is underpriced if it were not for the bad PR, but bad press will keep it down. That uncertainty is why I do not have a position.",0,0.519,NEGATIVE,1.0

Both companies are well known and respected in the pharmaceutical sector (my professional field) and overpaid for acquisitions that gained them a lot of debt and lawsuits. Bayer acquired Monsanto in 2018 for about 63 Billion USD and currently has a market cap of around 50B USD (less than half that of 2017). The company is made up of a crop science and a pharmaceutical arm, with some calling for the two to be split. While lawsuits are routine in both sectors and can get very ugly, the ones around glyphosate had gained an almost political level due to the cumulative hate directed at Monsanto. Monsanto was known to be cynically „ultracapitalist“ in their dealings and became a lightning rod of sorts. The takeover by Bayer with its de-facto rebranding did little to mitigate this. Fittingly enough, selling Monsanto was the cherry on the cake of cynical dealings. Since tables are messy to present in a post, I prefer just linking the sources this time: Q3/2022 Report, 2021 Report, 2020 Report. The acquisition did gain Bayer a ""complete"" cropsciences portfolio and some synergies, but the bad overshadowed the good. Net Debt went from 3.6 B EUR in 2017 to about 36 B EUR currently. Sales did rise from mid-30 to mid-40 B EUR, but the -13B EUR from „Litigations/Legal Risks“ in 2020 needs digesting. Bayer did not stop paying dividends, but is reasonably quite conservative in the amounts paid out (about a third of core earnings per share, 2.0 EUR for 2021). Overall I do not think that Bayer leadership handled the acquisition fallout particularly well, showing little dynamism. However, its current market capitalization is close to the bare bones. With continuing strong sales in two essential businesses, any value investor should pay attention. Debt management will need some consideration and many will steer clear for as long as lawsuits make headlines. That being said, Bayer represent the biggest allocation for individual stocks in my portfolio, so I’m personally quite confident in its future.

For generics manufacturers it‘s about size and reducing competition, for specialty drugs it‘s more complex. Usually a big player will invest in a promising new company and may buy it or its product to further develop in clinical programs. Clinical research is a field where having the right workforce and connections is essential, especially as complexity is increasing across the board.This increased complexity is why decades ago you could just employ some new promising graduates to develop an innovative product and now you buy entire biotech companies or their products.Now the Bayer-Monsanto acquisition is unlike the rest so it‘s objectively difficult to compare and even argue about its merits -or lack thereof. The sheer costs and PR downsides however overshadow everything else.",1,0.543,POSITIVE,0.979

Again, I wish you happy holidays and good luck with your investments!","I did mention the risks in the post, but they are difficult to quantify. Since you asked I will give my personal (!) opinion.Meta-analyses point to a higher risk of developing NHL with exposure to glyphosate in farming activities. These are chronic exposure analyses of multiple studies and have the big limitation of having to eliminate confounding factors (for instance other pesticides, but also more mundane risk factors like smoking or pollutants), as well as having to compare and weigh individual studies. Hence, and this was likely how Bayer thought, there will be no way to conclusively link glyphosate to NHL. Missing is the mechanism of action (the „how“), which puts Glyphosate in a different ballpark from asbestos, and makes determining causality scientifically untenable. It also puts Glyphosate in a different ballpark from smoking, simply because the relative risks are lower and amount of individuals affected much lower. Bayer likely underestimated the political aspect of the lawsuits: if the jury believes the EPA and EFSA to be in the pocket of (or gaslit by) Monsanto, anything becomes possible. Chronic toxicity tests in humans (to disprove the claim) are notoriously impractical, so it becomes a question of trust.The discussion around glyphosate has reached the point where I‘d argue its toxicity is overestimated. I‘d never use pesticides without proper protective equipment, even if all data indicates they are safe for use. Also if you don‘t use glyphosate (as a precautionary measure) you need to make sure the alternatives are not worse.The ruling on future claims is a fundamental and thorny matter that the supreme court may well try to avoid. Anything with the supreme court these days is highly political too.Regarding the opioid epidemic, fentanyl (newer generation opioids) was the big culprit. Pointing the finger to drug development more than a century ago makes little sense to me. Opium was a drug before that. Even fentanyl should not be erased from existence, it‘s a matter of controlling use and distribution.",3,0.511,NEGATIVE,1.0

Although you say you discussed the risks, I'm not sure you really appreciate the severity that they could represent. The 2020 amount they posted isn't necessarily the end of the issue. But I think we just agree to disagree and that's OK.For the opioid epidemic, I think you're missing my point here, so let me try to restate it. Regardless of Bayer's involvement in the early 20th century, the epidemic (along with other pharma changes, like overuse of antibiotics, renewed awareness of side effects, etc.) may (my opinion!) lead to more stringent script-writing than the past 70 years has seen. Couple this with the social pressure on pharma companies to not profit in ""healthcare"" (see: Covid vaccines & treatment), I think pharma is under pressure to re-brand to ""helping companies"" and not ""profit centers"". There has been a lot of politics in this space and loads of anecdotal stories (insulin costs, unavailability of chemo treatments, etc.) that I think paint pharma companies in a poor light. Then we have all the supply chain concerns (see: Kodak) and desire to bring more manufacturing back to more allied countries that will put pressure on the cost-side of the business.So in my mind, the methods for pharma companies to make money in the 21st century are different than they were in the 20th, and I'm not convinced that Bayer management is on board with that (hence the illegal kickbacks).I don't really think the stock is going to tank per se, but purely looking at ""market cap to debt"" ratio ignores a lot of the social and political headwinds that I think Bayer will inevitably face.",4,0.531,NEGATIVE,1.0

,"Fellow redditors, I like looking at blue chip companies in trouble and presented TEVA on this subreddit (here, update here). In my last post I mentioned that Bayer (BAYRY) has some similarities and there were some requests for insights into the company.
