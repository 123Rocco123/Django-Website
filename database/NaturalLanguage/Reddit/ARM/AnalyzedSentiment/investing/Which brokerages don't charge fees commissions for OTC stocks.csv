,"I'm sick and tired of Schwab charging me an arm and a leg every time I want to buy the dip or sell stock of major names like Nintendo, Rolls Royce, Sony, et cetera that are Other OTC stocks. I feel like a number of brokerages reversed on across-the-board $0 trading and began charging fees for things like penny stocks, but what brokerages still charge $0 on OTC stocks if I want to buy more traditional, less volatile ones?",I don't think that Fidelity charges a fee for domestic OTC but there is a $50/transaction fee for foreign ordinaries.I think Webull doesn't charge OTC fees either but they don't offer access to F shares afaik.In contrast - I think Schwab has a flat $6.95 OTC transaction fee plus $50/transaction fee for F shares.,0,0.512,NEGATIVE,0.999

So you don't necessarily need to invest via the F share.And Sony - for example - has a listed ADR so - it can make more sense to invest via the listed ADR than the OTC F share.I'm curious - why do you prefer holding the F shares? There is usually a lot less liquidity in the F shares vs the ADS's.,2,0.537,NEGATIVE,0.903

However, there are a couple companies where I really believe in their long-term vision and would like to continue slowly building a position on. i just ask because it’s pretty irritating getting charged $7 bucks every time I want to purchase a modest amount every few months.",1,0.526,NEGATIVE,0.999

While it may be irritating to a degree, it is much better now than it ever was. I am curious how you are getting charged $7 unless you are playing in foreign markets. I can only recall one instance of this happening to me myself, and I don't trade in Italian markets anymore because of it. If that IS the case for you, you may be better off starting a company offshore in the country you want to trade in with a local broker (though they will probably tax you just as bad, or worse, in some other manner). Sometimes you just have to chalk it up to the cost of doing business, or change where you do business at if you don't want to absorb the costs. If you have a good relationship with another broker then by all means. I use Schwab myself, and have a few qualms, but when I ask for my money I get it on demand. Their account security is much better than average as well (can't spend what ain't there). They aren't packing their shit up in the middle of the night and pulling out a Houdini anytime soon either. Every link in the chain is all risk, from the first dollar put in to the last one out. If you are on the ropes, make an account with multiple brokers in case shit happens with one, or so you can reap a benefit that isn't jointly offered. Compile a list of pros and cons and start weighing things out. Everything counts.",2,0.528,POSITIVE,0.747

They had a fancy website and everything! I get you, though, now 7 bucks a pop is annoying if you’re making frequent small moves.I had to sell a stock back then worth less than 20 bucks after the Tech Bubble. So in essence I had to pay Schwab just to remove the visual reminder of my stupidity.I like the Nintendo idea, btw.",2,0.517,NEGATIVE,0.998
