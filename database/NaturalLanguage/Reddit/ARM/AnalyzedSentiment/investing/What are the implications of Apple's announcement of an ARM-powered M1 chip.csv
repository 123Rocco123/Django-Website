Could Apple's more comprehensive and ecosystem backed shift to ARM lead to increased share in the personal computing market?","So the answer goes to the root of the difference between x86 and ARM. x86 is a CISC architecture (complex instruction set computer) while ARM is a RISC architecture (reduced instruction set computer). In layman's terms, what that means is x86 can do more in 1 instruction than an ARM computer can. So, in general, for an x86 and a ARM running at the same clock speed the x86 will be faster.But wait there are tradeoffs... having simpler instructions means ARM uses less power per instruction and is cheaper to design and produce.Is the threat to x86 architecture firms overstated?Will it eat market share? Sure. Is it a x86 replacement yet? No.Which companies are best suited to take advantage of this shift if it occurs?NVIDIA maybe if they buy ARM... but that already seems priced in. Apple maybe if it helps their margins. For the other integrators themselves (PC makers), I don't see much change as computer hardware market is mostly commodity... if the price of materials goes down so will the price of overall product.Does this affect the softbank sale and NVIDIA acquisition of ARM holdings?Doesn't appear too... Apple has some type of perpetual ARM license different than most other ARM license deals. I think think it was because they helped found that standard, can't remmeber.Any other lesser known companies that will benefit or lose out from a bigger shift to ARM computing?Probably not.Could Apple's more comprehensive and ecosystem backed shift to ARM lead to increased share in the personal computing market?Probably not. You pretty much are already an Apple computer user if you want to be and the PC market seems to be declining and is more locked by dependency on Windows for many workplaces than anything I would imagine.

They probably spend a higher % by $ amount on processors. I also wouldn’t be surprised if they start gaining laptop market share because of efficient power consumption. This will shrink that market by maybe 10% for x86 (mostly Intel due to switch).I don’t see Apple moving into the server market at all — which is really lucrative for Intel. Intel is being hit hard by AMD there. I wouldn’t be surprised if some ARM chip vendor (ie Qualcomm or marvel/cavium) decided to try to hit the server market again (there was hubbub on this in 2017-2018 but didn’t pan out for various reasons).Basically Intel is fucked and this explains why they are the only big tech with an 8 PE.,0,0.545,NEGATIVE,1.0

I haven't seen any discussion of the M1 chip on this subreddit (maybe something was deleted) so I wanted to bring it up and hear everyone's takes. The ARM architecture has hitherto been largely restricted to low power consumption devices (phones, tablets), but the M1 chip may popularize larger, higher performance form factors, providing direct competition to Intel and AMD, who design chips with the x86 and x86-64 architecture, the typical architecture in most PCs and Macs. Here is some reading I have done on the recent news: Review of the M1 chip with some context on ARM vs x86: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/hands-on-with-the-apple-m1-a-seriously-fast-x86-competitor/ A wikipedia article on Apple's transition to ARM processorsr: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_transition_to_Apple_Silicon Another article talking about Microsoft's efforts to move to the ARM architecture as well: https://siliconangle.com/2020/06/26/exiting-x86-apple-microsoft-embracing-arm-based-pc/ I have a few discussion questions: Is the threat to x86 architecture firms overstated? Which companies are best suited to take advantage of this shift if it occurs? Does this affect the softbank sale and NVIDIA acquisition of ARM holdings? Any other lesser known companies that will benefit or lose out from a bigger shift to ARM computing? Could Apple's more comprehensive and ecosystem backed shift to ARM lead to increased share in the personal computing market?",The only one who can compete with Apple and realize the same advantages that Apple will be enjoying due to this move to ARM is Microsoft. No one else will be able to. And in order for Microsoft to pull it off they need to design their own processors.I think the m1 products will take some market share from the x86 notebook market but probably won’t take a devastating chunk of it.But students and professionals looking for new laptops will certainly be eyeing MacBooks more than ever before.Only Microsoft can effectively counter but Apple has a decade of silicon design experience already under its belt.,0,0.542,NEGATIVE,0.925
