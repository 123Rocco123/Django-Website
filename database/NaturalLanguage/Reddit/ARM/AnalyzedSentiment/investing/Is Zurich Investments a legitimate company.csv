,They reached out to my dad (not their client) about selling him ARM stock for IPO price @51$ after the ARM was already trading on the stock market around 58$. Apparently they found him based on his big ‚investments’ in cryptos and want him as their client. Now they are offering Birkenstock at 25$ a share pre IPO. All this looks very sketchy to me but I cannot find a single negative review online on them or anything that would prove that this is a scam. I thought that pre IPO shares have a lock up period but somehow they can sell the shares to my dad and promise my dad to be able to sell on the day of IPO. Is this real/legal?,I'm suspicious of ANY company that reaches out to me on principle. They are by definition hoping to make a financial gain from me by creating a perception of needing their product or service.To me the burden is on them to make me understand why they want my money. Especially since I'm a little guy.,0,0.584,NEGATIVE,0.998
