,"Russia announced that they now have hypersonic technology. Considering this would be a next arms race, what would be favorable companies to invest in if this is true?",Why get fancy? Just drop a bundle of inanimate tungsten telephone poles from orbit onto anything you want to obliterate.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brilliant_Pebbles,0,0.52,NEGATIVE,0.623
,"Russia announced that they now have hypersonic technology. Considering this would be a next arms race, what would be favorable companies to invest in if this is true?","Brilliant PebblesBrilliant Pebbles was a ballistic missile defense (BMD) system proposed by Lowell Wood and Edward Teller of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in 1987, near the end of Cold War. The system would consist of thousands of small missiles, not unlike conventional heat seeking missiles, which would be placed in orbits so that hundreds would be above the Soviet Union at all times. If the Soviets launched its ICBM fleet, the pebbles would detect their rocket motors using infrared seekers and collide with them. Because the pebble strikes the ICBM before the latter could release its warheads, each pebble could destroy several warheads with one shot.[ ^PM | Exclude ^me | Exclude from ^subreddit | FAQ / ^Information | ^Source ] Downvote to remove | v0.28",1,0.509,NEGATIVE,1.0

All ICBMs are hypersonic, and both sides have deployed maneuverable MIRVs for decades. I don't think anyone's that worked up about it outside the popular press.https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-the-us-is-quietly-winning-the-hypersonic-arms-race",0,0.525,NEGATIVE,0.951
,"Russia announced that they now have hypersonic technology. Considering this would be a next arms race, what would be favorable companies to invest in if this is true?","Hypersonic Glide Vehicles are used to evade ABM systems. It is not obvious that russian HGVs will result in an arms race, as they just reset the status quo to where it was for decades: Neither side has an effective ABM systen and deterence is in place.If there is an arms race between ABM systems and Hypersonic systems, the usual companies may benefit: LM, NG, Boeing and Raytheon in no particular order. Additionally upstarts like SpaceX and BO may provide the launchb capabilities to finally make space-based ABM systems like Brilliant Pebbels a reality. Traditional launch companies simply couldnt provide the necessairy $/kg into LEO.PS: rods from god are a meme that no one is seriously considering. And no, Brilliant Pebbles has nothing to do with rods from god.",0,0.517,NEGATIVE,0.999
