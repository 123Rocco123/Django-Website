,"If you hold investments through a bank that fails, are those at risk of loss? Say I own a share of $ABC through the investment arm of whatever custodian, and that entity fails. Do I still have my share of $ABC? If not, are investments protected at all like deposit accounts?","Custodians are covered under SIPC if they fail or go bankrupt. Similar to FDIC, but specific to investment firms compared to banks.SIPC protects against the loss of cash and securities – such as stocks and bonds – held by a customer at a financially-troubled SIPC-member brokerage firm. The limit of SIPC protection is $500,000, which includes a $250,000 limit for cash.",0,0.511,POSITIVE,0.988

Do I still have my share of $ABC? If not, are investments protected at all like deposit accounts?","Would an investor with >$500k be wise to consider splitting their investments among multiple custodians, then? Or is every individual account insured (my IRA, spouse’s IRA, this investment account, that investment account…), and you just need to keep each account under $500k?",1,0.511,NEGATIVE,0.975

It is commonly disclosed by the broker so check with your broker. Bear in mind that SIPC limits are aggregated limits on per account type/owner.As for splitting out accounts - it's not a bad idea or you do stuff like hold treasuries in the account.Additionally - some brokers offer automatic bank sweeps which sweep excess cash into separate FDIC insured bank accounts at different banks as well if that is desirable.Also - custodians and brokers are technically separate functions. Many brokers provide the custodial service. But it is possible to use a separatee custodial relationship managed through an investment manager and using execution services are different brokers - but this more typical with institutions and very high networth families.,2,0.523,NEGATIVE,0.938

Do I still have my share of $ABC? If not, are investments protected at all like deposit accounts?","What this guy said, but also you may want to consider having accounts and different brokers. Yes all your accounts would be insured, but it's a lot less risk to have potentially 1 account with 1 broker going insolvent, than 5 accounts at 1 broker going insolvent.",3,0.549,NEGATIVE,0.982

They would be transferred to another broker.,0,0.515,NEGATIVE,0.999

For example, Merrill which is part of Bank of America or ETrade which is part of Morgan Stanley are separate entities.If a bank that owns a broker-dealer fails - the broker-dealer would be an asset which could just be sold off and the accounts would go with it.Your stocks and bonds would be in that broker-dealer who would be a member of SIPC. If the broker-dealer becomes insolvent, SIPC would make sure that you get your share of $ABC back.Even thought not a bank example - a recent example would be FTX - when FTX failed and even with all the fraud involved. FTX had a separate business in the US for customers who could buy stocks. Those stocks were actually held at a different clearing firm and accessible to customers who bought stocks through FTX.",0,0.534,NEGATIVE,1.0

I don't know how that would be handled since fractional shares are a facility provided by the broker.,2,0.525,NEGATIVE,0.957

Do I still have my share of $ABC? If not, are investments protected at all like deposit accounts?",As long as the bankruptcy is contained to one or two banks. FDIC or SIPC should cover it or your assets will be moved to another company if they buy up the bankrupt banks assets. Depositors/creditors are always first in line to paid out in case the bad banks assets are liquidated.,0,0.554,POSITIVE,0.743
