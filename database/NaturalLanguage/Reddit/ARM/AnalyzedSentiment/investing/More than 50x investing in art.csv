,"This is the story of how I multiplied my investment by more than 50x by buying art. This is the story of how I became an art dealer. I am Brazilian, 36 years old, a marketer with an MBA in marketing and branding. In 2020, I owned two barbershops in my city, with an annual turnover of approximately 350k USD. Like many others, we had to close during the pandemic, and I found myself newly married and without income. I tried to think of various new businesses, played online poker, battled depression, and in the midst of it all, I saw an opportunity: investing in art. Art has always been a passion in my life. My mother, who had me at 16, had her first degree in Fine Arts. So, when she had no one to leave me with, she took me to her art classes. I have many tattoos and a great appreciation for surrealism and Salvador Dalí. I even have his face tattooed on my left arm and the elephant with thin legs on my leg. My original idea was to create a hybrid gallery (a marketplace and host exhibitions in non-traditional venues like restaurants, stores, and even my own barbershop). I started collecting various artists with this strategy in mind and held my first exhibition in the barbershop, but it resulted in zero sales. Three exhibitions in a friend's home decor store and another in a restaurant also resulted in no sales. I needed to learn from this—either my artworks didn't work, or I was in the wrong place. During this journey, I pursued a new specialization in Art Business and learned more about how the art market operates. Brazil, being a third-world country with a significantly deflated currency compared to the dollar and euro (1 USD = approximately 4.85 Brazilian Reais), led me to a new theory: buy in Reais and sell in a strong currency. For this, I needed a truly unique product that would attract collectors worldwide. Among the artists I started buying from, one stood out. This artist had over a million followers on social media and ticked all the validation points—mastery of technique, academic refinement, authentic work, and most importantly, customers! This artist released serialized sculptures (50 to 70 units per edition), and the prices increased with each sold-out batch, ranging from 200 USD to 1.5k USD in a matter of weeks. My mind exploded when I saw this. I seized the opportunity and bought three sculptures, two from the first batch and one from the second. Over time, I observed the artist's creative process—creating a drawing, transforming it into a painting and/or sculpture. I concluded that if the serialized sculptures appreciated so quickly, why wouldn't the paintings that inspired them be equally valuable? It involved a higher investment, but the returns could be exponentially greater. All of his paintings were oil-based, taking months to complete and were unique. I made my first painting acquisition and scheduled a trip to São Paulo to pick it up and meet the artist in person. In August 2021, during the pandemic, my wife and I visited the artist's old 300m² apartment, which served as both a studio and residence. This turned out to be the luckiest moment of my life, defined as being in the right place at the right time with the right vision and attitude. The artist had a dispute with his former art dealer, and I seized the opportunity, buying nine paintings with every penny I had. In December of the same year, the artist invited me to exhibit my collection at his first major solo exhibition in São Paulo in April. He also granted me priority to buy new works and handle the pre-sale, earning a 20% commission on sales. Despite being financially tight, I sold 20 paintings to friends and family in four days, acquiring three more with my commission. I then founded a ""collectors' club,"" taking responsibility for the next sale and tasks related to exhibitions and artwork storage. The São Paulo exhibition was incredible, attracting over 15,000 visitors in a month. Our partnership solidified with a contract designating me as the commercial sector representative. The first part of my strategy was coming together—I now had a powerful collection capable of being exported. The question remained: how? I continued studying, improving my English, and found a Brazilian government program for exporting, offering free training. Simultaneously, I worked relentlessly to find works from previous collectors. In 2022, I found a collection in Rio de Janeiro at an incredible price. In 2022, I continued handling sales to clients in Brazil, still without any sales from my collection. In April 2023, the first sale to a foreign customer emerged—a collector from Texas who discovered me through Twitter. This individual acquired one painting from the artist's collection and one from my collection (I will provide the values at the end). In my research, I found interesting marketplaces to list the artist's collection, with Saatchiart being the most suitable. It didn't take long, and in May, the first sale was completed to a customer in Denmark. However, we encountered a customs issue during the artwork shipment. I had to get in touch with the customer, leading to a better acquaintance. I introduced my collection, and the customer showed interest in two pieces, which I personally delivered to him in June. Here are the values of the three paintings that I have sold so far: Painting 1 - Purchase price: 200 USD (1/10 of the Rio de Janeiro collector's collection) Selling price: 12,000 USD Painting 2 - Purchase price: 720 USD (acquired from the artist with my commission during the São Paulo exhibition pre-sale) Selling price: 12,000 euros Painting 3 - Purchase price: 2,100 USD (purchased from the artist in 2021) Selling price: 23,000 euros Currently, I have 35 paintings in the club's collection, and the next steps include an exhibition in Rio de Janeiro in August/24 and the first European exhibition in 2025. I hope this story inspires you to invest in what you believe in. If I could offer four tips to those reading: Don't listen to friends and family when starting a new, unusual project. They won't understand until the first cent comes in, which may take years. Study! Don't just go for shallow and superficial content; be curious. Be resilient. It may sound cliché, but it's fundamental and real. I faced many difficulties until the first sale, over two years. Be a diamond hand! Understand exactly how much your worth is and be willing to hold onto that value until the end. That's what will provide a foundation for your wealth.

My mother, who had me at 16, had her first degree in Fine Arts. So, when she had no one to leave me with, she took me to her art classes. I have many tattoos and a great appreciation for surrealism and Salvador Dalí. I even have his face tattooed on my left arm and the elephant with thin legs on my leg. My original idea was to create a hybrid gallery (a marketplace and host exhibitions in non-traditional venues like restaurants, stores, and even my own barbershop). I started collecting various artists with this strategy in mind and held my first exhibition in the barbershop, but it resulted in zero sales. Three exhibitions in a friend's home decor store and another in a restaurant also resulted in no sales. I needed to learn from this—either my artworks didn't work, or I was in the wrong place. During this journey, I pursued a new specialization in Art Business and learned more about how the art market operates. Brazil, being a third-world country with a significantly deflated currency compared to the dollar and euro (1 USD = approximately 4.85 Brazilian Reais), led me to a new theory: buy in Reais and sell in a strong currency. For this, I needed a truly unique product that would attract collectors worldwide. Among the artists I started buying from, one stood out. This artist had over a million followers on social media and ticked all the validation points—mastery of technique, academic refinement, authentic work, and most importantly, customers! This artist released serialized sculptures (50 to 70 units per edition), and the prices increased with each sold-out batch, ranging from 200 USD to 1.5k USD in a matter of weeks. My mind exploded when I saw this. I seized the opportunity and bought three sculptures, two from the first batch and one from the second. Over time, I observed the artist's creative process—creating a drawing, transforming it into a painting and/or sculpture. I concluded that if the serialized sculptures appreciated so quickly, why wouldn't the paintings that inspired them be equally valuable? It involved a higher investment, but the returns could be exponentially greater. All of his paintings were oil-based, taking months to complete and were unique. I made my first painting acquisition and scheduled a trip to São Paulo to pick it up and meet the artist in person. In August 2021, during the pandemic, my wife and I visited the artist's old 300m² apartment, which served as both a studio and residence. This turned out to be the luckiest moment of my life, defined as being in the right place at the right time with the right vision and attitude. The artist had a dispute with his former art dealer, and I seized the opportunity, buying nine paintings with every penny I had. In December of the same year, the artist invited me to exhibit my collection at his first major solo exhibition in São Paulo in April. He also granted me priority to buy new works and handle the pre-sale, earning a 20% commission on sales. Despite being financially tight, I sold 20 paintings to friends and family in four days, acquiring three more with my commission. I then founded a ""collectors' club,"" taking responsibility for the next sale and tasks related to exhibitions and artwork storage. The São Paulo exhibition was incredible, attracting over 15,000 visitors in a month. Our partnership solidified with a contract designating me as the commercial sector representative. The first part of my strategy was coming together—I now had a powerful collection capable of being exported. The question remained: how? I continued studying, improving my English, and found a Brazilian government program for exporting, offering free training. Simultaneously, I worked relentlessly to find works from previous collectors. In 2022, I found a collection in Rio de Janeiro at an incredible price. In 2022, I continued handling sales to clients in Brazil, still without any sales from my collection. In April 2023, the first sale to a foreign customer emerged—a collector from Texas who discovered me through Twitter. This individual acquired one painting from the artist's collection and one from my collection (I will provide the values at the end). In my research, I found interesting marketplaces to list the artist's collection, with Saatchiart being the most suitable. It didn't take long, and in May, the first sale was completed to a customer in Denmark. However, we encountered a customs issue during the artwork shipment. I had to get in touch with the customer, leading to a better acquaintance. I introduced my collection, and the customer showed interest in two pieces, which I personally delivered to him in June. Here are the values of the three paintings that I have sold so far: Painting 1 - Purchase price: 200 USD (1/10 of the Rio de Janeiro collector's collection) Selling price: 12,000 USD Painting 2 - Purchase price: 720 USD (acquired from the artist with my commission during the São Paulo exhibition pre-sale) Selling price: 12,000 euros Painting 3 - Purchase price: 2,100 USD (purchased from the artist in 2021) Selling price: 23,000 euros Currently, I have 35 paintings in the club's collection, and the next steps include an exhibition in Rio de Janeiro in August/24 and the first European exhibition in 2025. I hope this story inspires you to invest in what you believe in. If I could offer four tips to those reading: Don't listen to friends and family when starting a new, unusual project. They won't understand until the first cent comes in, which may take years. Study! Don't just go for shallow and superficial content; be curious. Be resilient. It may sound cliché, but it's fundamental and real. I faced many difficulties until the first sale, over two years. Be a diamond hand! Understand exactly how much your worth is and be willing to hold onto that value until the end. That's what will provide a foundation for your wealth. I know that my sales are far below the values shown here, but I believe it's just the tip of the iceberg. This is not just a story about numbers but about believing. Wishing you much art and ""luck"" on your journey!","The “buy from the artist and flip to the patron” is a good gig if you can get it. Finding an artist that likes to work, keeps prices reasonable, isn’t crazy, continues to make “displayable art” and doesn’t somehow self destruct has been tricky in my experience. This is especially true as the artist (and the dealer) reaches middle age. Great work my man!!",0,0.508,POSITIVE,0.999

Wishing you much art and ""luck"" on your journey!",I’ve been a dealer in the past but found that it was difficult for me to maintain the spread between collector and artist. The artists I worked with wanted as much $$ as they could get for their work (naturally) esp as they got older and most had a very hard time seeing the value add I brought to the table after the price for their work increased past a certain price point. Further it became much easier for collectors to connect directly with artists they were interested in (since Instagram for sure) and the collectors would pay full price (or more). Interestingly the spouse/boyfriend/girlfriend of the artist would push them to go direct to collectors and the spouse/Xfriend would manage the business side. Works great for some…I eventually moved on to bigger better things so no biggie but it was an interesting time and I enjoyed the experience.,2,0.522,POSITIVE,0.993

,"This is the story of how I multiplied my investment by more than 50x by buying art. This is the story of how I became an art dealer. I am Brazilian, 36 years old, a marketer with an MBA in marketing and branding. In 2020, I owned two barbershops in my city, with an annual turnover of approximately 350k USD. Like many others, we had to close during the pandemic, and I found myself newly married and without income. I tried to think of various new businesses, played online poker, battled depression, and in the midst of it all, I saw an opportunity: investing in art. Art has always been a passion in my life. My mother, who had me at 16, had her first degree in Fine Arts. So, when she had no one to leave me with, she took me to her art classes. I have many tattoos and a great appreciation for surrealism and Salvador Dalí. I even have his face tattooed on my left arm and the elephant with thin legs on my leg. My original idea was to create a hybrid gallery (a marketplace and host exhibitions in non-traditional venues like restaurants, stores, and even my own barbershop). I started collecting various artists with this strategy in mind and held my first exhibition in the barbershop, but it resulted in zero sales. Three exhibitions in a friend's home decor store and another in a restaurant also resulted in no sales. I needed to learn from this—either my artworks didn't work, or I was in the wrong place. During this journey, I pursued a new specialization in Art Business and learned more about how the art market operates. Brazil, being a third-world country with a significantly deflated currency compared to the dollar and euro (1 USD = approximately 4.85 Brazilian Reais), led me to a new theory: buy in Reais and sell in a strong currency. For this, I needed a truly unique product that would attract collectors worldwide. Among the artists I started buying from, one stood out. This artist had over a million followers on social media and ticked all the validation points—mastery of technique, academic refinement, authentic work, and most importantly, customers! This artist released serialized sculptures (50 to 70 units per edition), and the prices increased with each sold-out batch, ranging from 200 USD to 1.5k USD in a matter of weeks. My mind exploded when I saw this. I seized the opportunity and bought three sculptures, two from the first batch and one from the second. Over time, I observed the artist's creative process—creating a drawing, transforming it into a painting and/or sculpture. I concluded that if the serialized sculptures appreciated so quickly, why wouldn't the paintings that inspired them be equally valuable? It involved a higher investment, but the returns could be exponentially greater. All of his paintings were oil-based, taking months to complete and were unique. I made my first painting acquisition and scheduled a trip to São Paulo to pick it up and meet the artist in person. In August 2021, during the pandemic, my wife and I visited the artist's old 300m² apartment, which served as both a studio and residence. This turned out to be the luckiest moment of my life, defined as being in the right place at the right time with the right vision and attitude. The artist had a dispute with his former art dealer, and I seized the opportunity, buying nine paintings with every penny I had. In December of the same year, the artist invited me to exhibit my collection at his first major solo exhibition in São Paulo in April. He also granted me priority to buy new works and handle the pre-sale, earning a 20% commission on sales. Despite being financially tight, I sold 20 paintings to friends and family in four days, acquiring three more with my commission. I then founded a ""collectors' club,"" taking responsibility for the next sale and tasks related to exhibitions and artwork storage. The São Paulo exhibition was incredible, attracting over 15,000 visitors in a month. Our partnership solidified with a contract designating me as the commercial sector representative. The first part of my strategy was coming together—I now had a powerful collection capable of being exported. The question remained: how? I continued studying, improving my English, and found a Brazilian government program for exporting, offering free training. Simultaneously, I worked relentlessly to find works from previous collectors. In 2022, I found a collection in Rio de Janeiro at an incredible price. In 2022, I continued handling sales to clients in Brazil, still without any sales from my collection. In April 2023, the first sale to a foreign customer emerged—a collector from Texas who discovered me through Twitter. This individual acquired one painting from the artist's collection and one from my collection (I will provide the values at the end). In my research, I found interesting marketplaces to list the artist's collection, with Saatchiart being the most suitable. It didn't take long, and in May, the first sale was completed to a customer in Denmark. However, we encountered a customs issue during the artwork shipment. I had to get in touch with the customer, leading to a better acquaintance. I introduced my collection, and the customer showed interest in two pieces, which I personally delivered to him in June. Here are the values of the three paintings that I have sold so far: Painting 1 - Purchase price: 200 USD (1/10 of the Rio de Janeiro collector's collection) Selling price: 12,000 USD Painting 2 - Purchase price: 720 USD (acquired from the artist with my commission during the São Paulo exhibition pre-sale) Selling price: 12,000 euros Painting 3 - Purchase price: 2,100 USD (purchased from the artist in 2021) Selling price: 23,000 euros Currently, I have 35 paintings in the club's collection, and the next steps include an exhibition in Rio de Janeiro in August/24 and the first European exhibition in 2025. I hope this story inspires you to invest in what you believe in. If I could offer four tips to those reading: Don't listen to friends and family when starting a new, unusual project. They won't understand until the first cent comes in, which may take years. Study! Don't just go for shallow and superficial content; be curious. Be resilient. It may sound cliché, but it's fundamental and real. I faced many difficulties until the first sale, over two years. Be a diamond hand! Understand exactly how much your worth is and be willing to hold onto that value until the end. That's what will provide a foundation for your wealth.

Like many others, we had to close during the pandemic, and I found myself newly married and without income. I tried to think of various new businesses, played online poker, battled depression, and in the midst of it all, I saw an opportunity: investing in art. Art has always been a passion in my life. My mother, who had me at 16, had her first degree in Fine Arts. So, when she had no one to leave me with, she took me to her art classes. I have many tattoos and a great appreciation for surrealism and Salvador Dalí. I even have his face tattooed on my left arm and the elephant with thin legs on my leg. My original idea was to create a hybrid gallery (a marketplace and host exhibitions in non-traditional venues like restaurants, stores, and even my own barbershop). I started collecting various artists with this strategy in mind and held my first exhibition in the barbershop, but it resulted in zero sales. Three exhibitions in a friend's home decor store and another in a restaurant also resulted in no sales. I needed to learn from this—either my artworks didn't work, or I was in the wrong place. During this journey, I pursued a new specialization in Art Business and learned more about how the art market operates. Brazil, being a third-world country with a significantly deflated currency compared to the dollar and euro (1 USD = approximately 4.85 Brazilian Reais), led me to a new theory: buy in Reais and sell in a strong currency. For this, I needed a truly unique product that would attract collectors worldwide. Among the artists I started buying from, one stood out. This artist had over a million followers on social media and ticked all the validation points—mastery of technique, academic refinement, authentic work, and most importantly, customers! This artist released serialized sculptures (50 to 70 units per edition), and the prices increased with each sold-out batch, ranging from 200 USD to 1.5k USD in a matter of weeks. My mind exploded when I saw this. I seized the opportunity and bought three sculptures, two from the first batch and one from the second. Over time, I observed the artist's creative process—creating a drawing, transforming it into a painting and/or sculpture. I concluded that if the serialized sculptures appreciated so quickly, why wouldn't the paintings that inspired them be equally valuable? It involved a higher investment, but the returns could be exponentially greater. All of his paintings were oil-based, taking months to complete and were unique. I made my first painting acquisition and scheduled a trip to São Paulo to pick it up and meet the artist in person. In August 2021, during the pandemic, my wife and I visited the artist's old 300m² apartment, which served as both a studio and residence. This turned out to be the luckiest moment of my life, defined as being in the right place at the right time with the right vision and attitude. The artist had a dispute with his former art dealer, and I seized the opportunity, buying nine paintings with every penny I had. In December of the same year, the artist invited me to exhibit my collection at his first major solo exhibition in São Paulo in April. He also granted me priority to buy new works and handle the pre-sale, earning a 20% commission on sales. Despite being financially tight, I sold 20 paintings to friends and family in four days, acquiring three more with my commission. I then founded a ""collectors' club,"" taking responsibility for the next sale and tasks related to exhibitions and artwork storage. The São Paulo exhibition was incredible, attracting over 15,000 visitors in a month. Our partnership solidified with a contract designating me as the commercial sector representative. The first part of my strategy was coming together—I now had a powerful collection capable of being exported. The question remained: how? I continued studying, improving my English, and found a Brazilian government program for exporting, offering free training. Simultaneously, I worked relentlessly to find works from previous collectors. In 2022, I found a collection in Rio de Janeiro at an incredible price. In 2022, I continued handling sales to clients in Brazil, still without any sales from my collection. In April 2023, the first sale to a foreign customer emerged—a collector from Texas who discovered me through Twitter. This individual acquired one painting from the artist's collection and one from my collection (I will provide the values at the end). In my research, I found interesting marketplaces to list the artist's collection, with Saatchiart being the most suitable. It didn't take long, and in May, the first sale was completed to a customer in Denmark. However, we encountered a customs issue during the artwork shipment. I had to get in touch with the customer, leading to a better acquaintance. I introduced my collection, and the customer showed interest in two pieces, which I personally delivered to him in June. Here are the values of the three paintings that I have sold so far: Painting 1 - Purchase price: 200 USD (1/10 of the Rio de Janeiro collector's collection) Selling price: 12,000 USD Painting 2 - Purchase price: 720 USD (acquired from the artist with my commission during the São Paulo exhibition pre-sale) Selling price: 12,000 euros Painting 3 - Purchase price: 2,100 USD (purchased from the artist in 2021) Selling price: 23,000 euros Currently, I have 35 paintings in the club's collection, and the next steps include an exhibition in Rio de Janeiro in August/24 and the first European exhibition in 2025. I hope this story inspires you to invest in what you believe in. If I could offer four tips to those reading: Don't listen to friends and family when starting a new, unusual project. They won't understand until the first cent comes in, which may take years. Study! Don't just go for shallow and superficial content; be curious. Be resilient. It may sound cliché, but it's fundamental and real. I faced many difficulties until the first sale, over two years. Be a diamond hand! Understand exactly how much your worth is and be willing to hold onto that value until the end. That's what will provide a foundation for your wealth. I know that my sales are far below the values shown here, but I believe it's just the tip of the iceberg. This is not just a story about numbers but about believing.
