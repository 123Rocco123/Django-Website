The result of more than 10,000 engineering years of work, the NVIDIA Grace™ CPU is designed to address the computing requirements for the world’s most advanced applications — including natural language processing, recommender systems and AI supercomputing — that analyze enormous datasets requiring both ultra-fast compute performance and massive memory. It combines energy-efficient Arm CPU cores with an innovative low-power memory subsystem to deliver high performance with great efficiency. “Leading-edge AI and data science are pushing today’s computer architecture beyond its limits – processing unthinkable amounts of data,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Using licensed Arm IP, NVIDIA has designed Grace as a CPU specifically for giant-scale AI and HPC. Coupled with the GPU and DPU, Grace gives us the third foundational technology for computing, and the ability to re-architect the data center to advance AI.

They're both great companies and they constantly amaze, constantly outdoing themselves and each other with innovative technology. I chose NVDA because they were a solid company with great earnings history andso their recent chips and graphics cards were amazing. They are producing on x86 architecture and actually beat intel in terms of cpu performance which basically nobody expected. Like people were blown away by the new zen architecture. However they do not have their own chip production facility like intel.They also are not nearly as big in the machine earning space. Basically everything I know is built on NVIDIA GPU's. This is because nvidia has great support for ml applications such as CUDA. Now some companies might build their own ml frameworks but basically AMD needs to get it together if they ever want people to use radeon graphics for machine learning.Anyway this recent dip into a new ARM architecture is insanely massive. Apple basically blew up the space with the m1 processor based on ARM. Ohh and btw if the acquisition of ARM doesn't get blocked they will own the future of computing.So I would say AMD is not yet out of the race they have shown incredibly adaptable. They also have the potential to grow a lot more as their market cap is still smaller.However to me NVIDIA looks like just as easy win.",4,0.548,POSITIVE,0.964
