,"Many years ago, I started investing with USAA. Although their management rates and services weren't ideal, it was easy and straightforward - so I stuck with it, and continued to stay with it out of convenience. Well, now USAA has sold its investment arm to Schwab and Victory Capital. I have one remaining mutual fund with USAA (USSPX), this is due to be transferred to Victory Capital during Q3 of this year. I am not super impressed with Victory Capital and would prefer to wipe my hands clean of USAA funds. Ideally, to move it to SWPPX. The problem is that I have a 5-figure gain in USSPX and if I exit the mutual fund, I create a taxable event in the thousands of dollars. I would like to avoid this for obvious reasons, but I can't think of any way to do that. I have a feeling that there is no way around this, but am posting just in case I am wrong.",Regular brokerage.

If you are married then that could be an option without having to sell it. Also with kids you could likely gift assets to them too up to max of 15k per year.If you are involved in charitable causes then you could look into donating assets rather than moneyIf you have any stinkers in your portfolio you could harvest some losses to offset the gains.With a 5 figgy gain it's probably worth the money to get professional tax help.",0,0.53,NEGATIVE,1.0

I wouldn't worry about Victory not handling that. The ER while not terrific is reasonable. I think the reasonable thing to do is leave it. When you need to rebalance out of USA or large cap you know what to sell.If you really want to move out start doing paired transaction to generate some long term capital losses. But that's an aweful lot of annoyance for essentially nothing.,0,0.516,NEGATIVE,1.0

Is there anything specific about victory capital that you are concerned about.You could do the math to see if deferring taxes would be better than eating the expense fee. Assuming a 7% annual return and a 20% capital gains rate, that means you are “losing” 1.4% per year on the money subject to capital gains. You may have a higher or lower taxes (state taxes) or a different assumption on long term returns.It really depends on how high your cost basis is relative to the gains you have.",2,0.533,NEGATIVE,0.993

This would give you the full value in write-off, subject to some limits which you DEFINITELY should check first, and would not cause you to pay any capital gains. If you donate to a donor advised fund or something, you can then write checks to charities out of that whenever, while staying invested, forever. You just can't use the money for personal purposes any more.The fees are a little high, but it's not a total loser. I'd not be in a rush to sell, and just should disable dividend reinvestment if you aren't donating it.",0,0.513,NEGATIVE,0.97
