Is this because they ran up a lot earlier in the year and people just taking profits? Do we expect a strong recovery in 2025?","Short answer (IMO) - there is some growing pessimism regarding the rate of AI expansion by researchers/analysts due to potential limitations in energy availability and the theoretical maximum capability/usefulness of current gen AI systems, causing devaluation of the near term theoretical TAM for the industry. Much of the justification for the extremely high revenue/earnings multiples in semis was driven by not just anticipated growth of AI systems and the hardware they run on, but anticipated acceleration of that growth. There's now a percolating sentiment (whether you agree with it or not) that AI may not (yet) be quite capable enough to justify the accelerating ramp up in data center capacity that was anticipated ~9 months ago. Major players in the space have been insisting for a while now that there is no foreseeable future bottleneck in AI intelligence capability, and that energy and computing infrastructure were the only bottlenecks to arbitrarily large improvements in the actual intelligence of the AI systems (almost all CEOs are still sticking to this theory). Some researchers however are now second guessing that assertion, and future energy demands have still not been resolved at the planning level, which may limit build out of AI focused data centers even if the research/results justify doing so. All that is to say that the near future (1-3 year) growth of semis may be less dramatic than expected ~ a year ago. So, while the current results show us staying on that growth curve, folks are now less optimistic about where the actual top of that curve will be, resulting in diminished enthusiasm for the correlated stocks. The next upward catalyst I'll be looking in the AI space will be release of a feature/product by openAI or other provider that demonstrates a clear and compelling value proposition for businesses to reinvigorate fervor about the potential value of AI technology. That, or if we start seeing more stories about entrepreneurs using existing AI to disrupt existing business models/industries then it may reinforce the competitive necessity of the systems, thus potentially allowing more aggressive pricing by the semi providers and higher earnings margins.

It appears to be a typical boom bust cycle. Shortages during covid lead to too much probuction after it passed. Big advances in AI leading to a surge of new AI companies and a demand for more chips. And a law encouraging manufacturing in the US. It's the industry has had this issue for at least 40years.One of the big reasons to this boom bust cycle is the manufacturing facilities take years to build and and the manufacturing equipment is expensive. And also you need to train and hire workers to run operate and maintain the equipment. So companies are reluctant to spend the money util they are sure they will need it. And if several companies decide to start construction at the same time stock prices go up. But if there is too much production companies cut back on new production.
