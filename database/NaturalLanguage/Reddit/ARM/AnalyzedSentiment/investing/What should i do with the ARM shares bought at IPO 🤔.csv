ARM while being a fundamental product in smart phones/ Autos and almost everywhere else, is not growing that much. Plus they make peanuts out of every chip sold. So for them to 10x, they have to make something new that get them more $ per chip sold and sell a lot of them and keep growing.Buying a new IPO is always a huge risk. Even companies that keep climbing a lot at IPO ultimately goes down. $SNOW did go below its IPO price as did $ZM. So its better to put a new stock on watchlist and monitor the business before going all in. You need consistencies in revenue/earnings/free cash flow/growth before buying the stock.
