,"Hey! Today is without a doubt a substantial day. $10,000 earnt throughout my year of investing. From a tech-crash with a venomous drawdown in August to this new high, with more to come... I feel I've established a strong mentality around all this, and as we say in my country; ""learnt to keep my stomach cool"". Resourses, fame, or power shouldn't change who you are. The ones who let it get to their head and expect to be treated in difference are naive. But you can carry it like a badge of honour. 'You worked hard, and these were the results'. In every waking moment, through hardship and joy, you can look back to those unyielding numbers and feel a sense of pride. This goes for anything, developing your language skills, your physical body or rating in chess. When you enter a room with a cluster of new and undiscovered personalities, no one needs, or has to know these things. You did these things for yourself, and so they should treat you, and not anybody else. At the end of your life, it won't be these trivial things that you look back on, but rather the work that was put into it. You will realise that all the labour reflected into all other parts of your life, your close family, and friends, your achivements, betterment of society, and the people around you. The small but positive things you did, that you wouldn't had done if you didn't wear your ""badge"". In the weak moments, where you could look at yourself as an object, and feel good with what you say, where you realized that 'maybe all hope isn't so lost, because I have this foundation of which I've built through my own hard work, that has my back'. This milestone is hopefully just the beginning for me. I have ambitions, both in my career, investing, and future as a person. Now, the next time I start to doubt myself, I have this milestone to lift me by arms up again, but just up on my knees, where I'll once again put in my provably hard work to get back on my feet. Thank you!","Going to be honest, I have no idea what you mean by this, but I'm happy for you. ",0,0.588,POSITIVE,0.998
