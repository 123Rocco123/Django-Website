,"Hello, In the light of recent news and the way I see the evolution of the industry I would like to invest in the ARM architecture continued success. The stock for ARM holdings seems to have been halted after Softbank’s acquisition, so I would like to study different options on how to indirectly invest in its success. Any ideas? Thanks","Kinda answered your own question. Softbank is publicly traded. I don't like having to own Softbank to own ARM, and was pretty disappointed ARM was acquired - not because I think Softbank made a mistake, but ARM is a very attractive company.",0,0.546,POSITIVE,0.93

Thanks","ARM already dominates the mobile space. Mobile has nowhere to grow, so ARM won't grow there.The next play is if ARM can make its way into the data center market, which is dominated by Intel/AMD.So I'd look for companies that are planning to break into the data center market with an ARM architecture.I would be on the lookout for any developments of ARM's in the AI space, though I'm not current on that.",2,0.582,NEGATIVE,0.999
