,"Tl;dr: EXPC stock is worth at least 154% more than its present price of $12.9 (As of 03/14/2021). Both EXPC and RTP have significant catalysts lined up ahead that will likely boost the SP from current lows post-NASDAQ sell-off. What to expect Understanding the eVTOL Space Outlook for EXPC and RTP SPAC Transaction Summary What Blade/ EXPC and Joby/ RTP Stocks are Worth How I am playing EXPC and RTP Useful Links Understanding the eVTOL Space (Note: Skip to next section if you feel reading this background info is a drag) Before I even start discussing tickers and plays, I'd first like to shed some light on the groundbreaking Urban Air Mobility (UAM) space, where it's heading and who are the top players vying for the bigger piece of the pie. Understanding the potential investment opportunities without understanding this nascent space is a mooo point. Electric VTOL (Vertical Take off & Landing) air taxis are one of the great emerging technologies of our time, promising to unlock the skies as traffic-free, high-speed, 3D commuting routes. Much quieter and cheaper than helicopter travel, they'll also run on zero-local-emission electric power, and many models suggest they'll cost around the same per mile as a ground-based ride share. Currently there are over 100 players around the globe (check this article to get an overview of some the key players in the eVTOL space) in various stages of designing, building and commercializing eVTOL airframes. As is the case with any disruptive industry, the development and production of eVTOLs is an insanely cash hungry undertaking. Currently, we've a handful of frontrunners around the world who have gone public (Chinese eVTOL $EH) or are ripe to go public soon. Here's a the link to a well rounded DD comparing RTP-ACIC-EXPC-EH-Volo-Lilium that I highly recommend checking out. The United States is acutely aware that it 'missed the boat' on consumer drones, and it's an understandably sore point. But perhaps more importantly the geopolitical consequences of Chinese drone dominance appear to have reverberated around the corridors of the Pentagon for some time. One consequence of this situation is that the latest area of rapid aerospace innovation - eVTOL - has firmly captured the attention of US industry, investors and now the Department of Defense. Leaders of all stripes Stateside are determined that America will indeed be 'first' in this new and exciting area of aerospace innovation. The Air Force recently launched Agility Prime, a non-traditional program seeking to accelerate the commercial market for advanced air mobility vehicles (i.e., ""flying cars""). Check their website here and highly recommend reading this Wired article by USAF's former Acquisition Executive, Will Roper who starts his argument by drawing inspiration from the Jetsons. The outlook for UAM looks positive based on increasing congestion in cities. There are various estimates of the TAM (total addressable market) of UAM. In its presentation, Archer Aviation said that it expects a TAM of $1.5 trillion for UAM, which stretches to $3 trillion in the optimistic scenario. Joby Aviation said that it sees the TAM for UAM at $1 trillion globally and $500 billion in the U.S. Joby Aviation cited the 2018 UAM Market Study from Booz Allen Hamilton for its forecasts. Now, What's stopping us from having eVTOL air taxis today, then? Here are some of the factors you should be considering while evaluating potential investment opportunities: Batteries!! - Battery manufacturers' roadmaps are currently focused on satiating EV manufacturers and developing battery packs with required energy density and specific power (i.e. ability to sustain Tesla's ludicrous mode for a few minutes v/s a few seconds) could take a few years. Alakai Skai's (currently supported by a single private investor) decision however, to ditch lithium batteries for a liquid hydrogen powertrain completely eliminates the battery technology bottleneck that almost every other company is hoping will resolve itself by the time they launch commercial services Certification - These are entirely new categories of aircraft, and the process of certifying, testing and regulating them is going to be monstrously expensive and time consuming. Federal support and urgency to outcompete global players should help the cause. Safety - To coordinate their thrust, each of the electric motor and fan units will need reliable sensors to accurately measure pressure, temperature and other indicators. Each of the motors will induce vibrations in the wings, and their fans may not all spin with the same efficiencies as wear and tear set in. It will be complicated to write software to reliably control all that, says Ella Atkins, an aerospace engineering professor at the University of Michigan. While Atkins says she doesn’t see anything that’s “absolutely a showstopper” with the design, she thinks the many years it took to solve the deadly control problems of the first tiltrotor aircraft, the U.S. military’s V-22 Osprey, offers a sobering parallel for Lilium and other EVTOL developers. “You need a lot of money and time to be successful in aerospace, and the truth is, this industry is trying to go too fast,” says Atkins. Next issue is use of ballistic parachutes. Ballistic parachutes can only save you above a certain altitude, maybe 120 feet or so. Below that, they don't have time to open up, which means that every time you take off or land in one of these machines, you're exposed to a window of time in which total system failure would drop you like a stone. Air Traffic Control - Down the track, there will also have to be a considerable leap forward in air traffic control if the skies are going to safely hold large numbers of these machines zipping about between a bunch of skyports/ vertiports dotted around an urban area. Public Perception - Public perception (trust and safety in tech) is a large obstacle. Safety is the greatest concern with “unruly” passengers, “lasing” of pilots, and aircraft sabotage being main contributors. New importance of travel time, increase in telecommuting, urbanization and de-congestion scenarios could reduce the viability of UAM markets. Advancement in driverless car tech will likely make UAMs suitable for long-distance commute only. All these problems are being worked on, and now we are ready to discuss 2 important SPAC plays that I have rounded up for investment in this space: Joby Aviation - $RTP (eVTOL Manufacturer | Long term play) Blade - $EXPC (eVTOL Asset Light Platform, aka 'Uber of skies'| Short-Mid term play) Outlook for EXPC and RTP Blade - EXPC Investor's presentation Blade is an eVTOL index play, often thought as the ""Uber of skies"" operates by connecting contract pilots with passengers to generate revenue via their proprietary platform. Blade’s business model is proven and is profitable; eVTOL is expected to improve unit economics and dramatically expand the addressable market of BLADE’s existing products. There are currently 167 different eVTOL aircraft under development. Blade is 1 of 1 asset light platform — poised to benefit regardless of which eVTOL manufacturer is first to market. Basically, Blade's strategy is akin to selling shovels in a gold rush. Rob Wiesenthal, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Blade, commented, “Ground mobility has been radically transformed by software and battery technology, as evidenced by the rapid adoption of electric vehicles. The next battle is in the air. This transaction provides the capital for Blade to profitably expand its urban air mobility business using conventional rotorcraft today, while providing a seamless transition to EVA aircraft tomorrow.” Blade and KSL have already identified around $300 million in short- to mid-term investment opportunities that will help Blade expand its presence in the northeastern United States, on the West Coast in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and in new markets that could include Vancouver, Jakarta, and Tokyo. (EXPC is sponsored by an affiliate of KSL Capital Partners, making the EXPC<>Blade strategic merger even more prudent). Blade operates in four key lines of business: Short Distance – Flights between 60 and 100 miles in distance, primarily servicing commuters for prices between $595 and $795 per seat (or $295 for monthly commuter pass holders). BLADE Airport – Flights between all New York area airports and dedicated Blade lounges in Manhattan’s heliports. Prices start at $195 per seat (or $95 per seat with the purchase of an annual Airport Pass)1 . BLADE MediMobility – Blade is the largest transporter of human organs in the Northeast United States, reducing the costs and transport time for hospitals versus legacy competitors. This business is a critical part of the Company’s growth strategy as organ movements are expected to be one of the first uses of EVA, before flights for passengers. International Joint Ventures – As part of its expansion strategy, the Company forms joint ventures with local partners in key overseas markets to provide the technology, customer experience, infrastructure design, and employee training, that enables a scalable and consistent Blade experience. Blade’s first international joint venture launched helicopter services late last year in India flying between Mumbai, Pune, and Shirdi. The Company expects to use proceeds from the transaction to fund expansion into new markets, including the Northeast Corridor and West Coast in the United States, as well as target addressable markets internationally (Vancouver, Jakarta and Tokyo). Blade's projected revenue outlook: Blade estimates its revenue in 2021 will reach $52 million. Moreover, by 2023, Blade estimates revenue will reach $181 million and $402 million by the end of 2024. This is all still before significant revenues occur from eVTOL which the company calls Phase 3 starting in 2025 and 2026. It does not assume any passenger eVTOL revenue before then. But in Phase 3, revenue is forecast to skyrocket to $601 million in 2025 and $875 million in 2026. (These numbers should be considered with a grain of salt) Blade's Competitive Moat: BLADE’s first mover advantage, extensive and loyal customer base and control of strategic infrastructure secures its leading position in the future of urban air mobility. #1 market share in key short-distance aviation markets, brings credibility to new market expansion. Strong management team with domain expertise and public market experience. BLADE is already slated to leverage and partner with KSL’s portfolio companies to generate attractive growth opportunities. Proprietary technologies and asset-light model enables flight volume growth and accelerates launch timeline for new markets While Joby Aviation - Uber partnership pose a significant competitive threat, it's worth noting that Uber Elevate failed to take off even with its branding and it'll be challenging for Joby to front the customer acquisition cost (after bleeding dry with production upscaling and certification costs) and outcompete Blade who have an edge in that domain with their ever growing loyal customer base. Another point to note is that Joby will be limited to their own aircrafts while Blade is already scanning potential players and will likely partner with different eVTOL operators depending on the nature of routes. ARKQ is holding 2,748,457 shares, which represents 9.99% of public float for EXPC. Once the merger is complete, there will be a total of 82.5M shares. This means ARK currently own 2.9% of the 82.5M shares. Leadership: Upon completion of the transaction, the combined company will continue to be led by Mr. Wiesenthal as Chief Executive Officer. The senior management team will also include Will Heyburn, Chief Financial Officer and Head of Corporate Development, Brandon Keene, Chief Technology Officer, and Melissa Tomkiel, General Counsel.

Joby Aviation - RTP Investor's presentation Fact Sheet Company has spent more than a decade developing piloted, all-electric, vertical takeoff and landing passenger aircraft, with over 1,000 test flights conducted to date. Intends to operate clean, quiet and affordable air taxi service starting in 2024; with a vision to offer flights at the same price as a ground-based taxi. First company to agree certification basis for an eVTOL aircraft with FAA First company to be granted airworthiness approval for an eVTOL aircraft by U.S. Air Force Company has strategic partnership with Toyota for production and recently acquired Uber Elevate and will be partnering with Uber for go-to-market and demand generation. Other partners include: Agility Prime - A USAF program that will provide Joby access to key research facilities and equipment and allows us to prove out the maturity and reliability of our aircraft. Toray - Joby Aviation and Toray Advanced Composites completed a long-term supply agreement for the composite material used for Joby’s aircraft. Garmin - Garmin will be providing their state-of-the-art G3000 integrated flight deck to Joby for our aircraft. The G3000 integrated flight deck has been reliably demonstrated across a variety of aircraft and brings seamless integration for the unique requirements of eVTOL aircraft. In 10 years, Joby’s presentation to investors projects a presence in over 20 cities worldwide with 14,000 aircraft in service generating more than $20 billion in revenue — electric air mobility at scale around the world. Up to five-year lock-up agreement and price-based vesting on certain sponsor shares ensures unprecedented long-term alignment, with some shares not vesting until Company achieves $30 billion market capitalization. Proceeds are expected to fund Company through start of passenger service launch, including certification of aircraft and development of manufacturing facilities. Joby's Competitive Moat: Expect to be first to market with the right aircraft 4 passenger aircraft to optimize unit economics Significant progress in certification Well developed go-to-market strategy enhanced through Uber Elevate acquisition World class engineering and certification team FAA Part 23 general aviation certification enables global reach Leadership: JoeBen Bevirt; Founder and Chief Executive Officer Paul Sciarra; Executive Chairman Matt Field; Chief Financial Officer (ex-CFO, North America, at Ford Motor Company, Prior to joining Ford, he worked at Goldman Sachs and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.)

SPAC Transaction Summary Blade - EXPC (Investor's presentation) The transaction will be funded by a combination of EIC ($EXPC) cash held in a trust account and proceeds from a $125m PIPE, of which KSL has committed to subscribing for ~$20m PF shares outstanding: 82.5 million Transaction reflects pro forma market capitalization of $1.604 billion (The share price as I'm writing this is $12.9) Transaction will result in $375m of cash to balance sheet to fund growth Transaction implies a fully diluted pro forma equity value of $689.25m for Blade Existing Blade shareholders expected to receive 43.2% of the pro forma equity The boards of directors of both Blade and Experience Investment Corp. have unanimously approved the proposed transaction. The transaction is expected to close in 1H 2021; predictions expect voting to happen in the last week of March/first week of April. Form 8-K Joby - RTP (Investor's presentation) PF shares outstanding: 660 million The pro forma implied market capitalization of the combined company is $6.6 billion, at the $10.00 per share PIPE subscription price and assuming no public shareholders of Reinvent exercise their redemption rights. The Company will receive at the time of transaction close up to $690 million in proceeds from Reinvent’s cash in trust and an $835 million private placement of common stock at a $10.00 per share value and will also convert a $75 million convertible note into common stock at a $10.00 per share value. Pro-forma for the transaction, Joby expects to have up to $1.974Bn of cash to fund growth and commercialize its operations Transaction implies a fully diluted pro-forma aggregate value of $4.6Bn (2.3x AV / 2026E Revenue) Existing Joby shareholders to roll 100% of their equity and expected to receive 76% of the pro-forma equity Up to five-year lock-up on founder shares. Major stockholders and key executives of Joby have agreed to enter into separate lockup agreements as well. Price-based vesting triggers of $12, $18, $24, $32 and $50 per share on founder shares The boards of directors of both Reinvent and Joby have unanimously approved the transaction, which is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2021. Form 8-K What Blade/ EXPC and Joby/ RTP Stocks are Worth Blade - EXPC PF shares outstanding: 82.5 million EXPC SP as of 03/14: $12.9 SPAC Cash = $375MM 82.5MM * $12.9/share = 1.064Bn PF Market Cap PF EV is = $689MM (PF Market Cap - SPAC Cash) Disruptive technology platforms have an average EV-sales ratio of 8.2x. In addition, luxury brands are at 7.5x and recent EV / SPAC mobility deals have averaged 6.5x. The average of all four of these groups of stocks is 7.4x. On page 37 of the presentation, Blade shows the EV-sales ratios of four groups of its peers. Unadjusted: 2024 estimated revenue is expected to be $402MM (Blade isn't accounting any eVTOL revenue, international expansion, operational upside or any strategic upside in this number). This means that the unadjusted EV-sales ratio for 2024 is 1.71x sales. That is very low. This means that at 7.4x $402 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $2.975 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is $3.35 billion. That is 215% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion. Unadjusted fair share price: 3.35Bn/82.5M = $40.61 Adjusted: We need to adjust the 2024 numbers to derive their present value. At a 15% discount rate for 4 years, the 2024 sales are worth 57.175% of this in today’s dollars. The present value sales number is $230 million (i.e., $402 million times 57.175%). As a result, the adjusted EV-sales multiple is 3x (i.e., $689 million EV divided by $230 million). This means that at 7.4x $230 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $1.702 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is $2.077 billion. That is 95.2% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion. Adjusted fair share price: 2.077Bn/82.5M = $25.2 Average between adjusted and unadjusted: Target market value is $2.713 billion. Fair share price: $32.89 Conclusion: EXPC stock is worth at least 154% more than its present price of $12.9 (As of 03/14/2021) This is without accounting all the hype from the merger announcement. Joby - RTP (Speculation) It's difficult to value this stock since all the revenue projections are subject to a lot of variables (Timely certification, customer acquisition, production delays, etc.) Yet, I am long term bullish on this stock. With almost $2 billion in capital on-hand, the Elevate team, and Toyota as a manufacturing partner, Bevirt’s company has everything it needs to achieve his vision of saving a billion people an hour a day. Check Ehang (Chinese competitor) stock's trajectory over past 6 months. Clear that there's a lot of excitement surrounding eVTOLs and the news of merger should send this stock soaring in next few months. ARKX ETF is slated to launch end of this month and RTP is a great match for Cathie Wood's sub-orbital space category. How I am playing EXPC and RTP Catalysts: ARKX ETF launch EOM makes both EXPC and RTP a great spec play EXPC - A lot of spec predictions floating around about the shareholder vote on 3/31 Post NASDAQ sell-off was brutal for all SPACs and especially EXPC and RTP but these stocks are bound to rebound. Positions: 30 calls for 05/21 at $20 strike price, 18 calls for 8/20 at $25 strike price. I am tempted to pick up 04/16 $30 calls tomorrow. I don't have any RTP shares/calls but I might pick up a few calls tomorrow as well. Note that I am only playing catalysts at this point but may buy shares for RTP for long term investment (>5years). I find advent of eVTOLs super exciting. Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, heck this is my first time writing a DD so what do I even know about investing.

But in Phase 3, revenue is forecast to skyrocket to $601 million in 2025 and $875 million in 2026. (These numbers should be considered with a grain of salt) Blade's Competitive Moat: BLADE’s first mover advantage, extensive and loyal customer base and control of strategic infrastructure secures its leading position in the future of urban air mobility. #1 market share in key short-distance aviation markets, brings credibility to new market expansion. Strong management team with domain expertise and public market experience. BLADE is already slated to leverage and partner with KSL’s portfolio companies to generate attractive growth opportunities. Proprietary technologies and asset-light model enables flight volume growth and accelerates launch timeline for new markets While Joby Aviation - Uber partnership pose a significant competitive threat, it's worth noting that Uber Elevate failed to take off even with its branding and it'll be challenging for Joby to front the customer acquisition cost (after bleeding dry with production upscaling and certification costs) and outcompete Blade who have an edge in that domain with their ever growing loyal customer base. Another point to note is that Joby will be limited to their own aircrafts while Blade is already scanning potential players and will likely partner with different eVTOL operators depending on the nature of routes.

SPAC Transaction Summary Blade - EXPC (Investor's presentation) The transaction will be funded by a combination of EIC ($EXPC) cash held in a trust account and proceeds from a $125m PIPE, of which KSL has committed to subscribing for ~$20m PF shares outstanding: 82.5 million Transaction reflects pro forma market capitalization of $1.604 billion (The share price as I'm writing this is $12.9) Transaction will result in $375m of cash to balance sheet to fund growth Transaction implies a fully diluted pro forma equity value of $689.25m for Blade Existing Blade shareholders expected to receive 43.2% of the pro forma equity The boards of directors of both Blade and Experience Investment Corp. have unanimously approved the proposed transaction. The transaction is expected to close in 1H 2021; predictions expect voting to happen in the last week of March/first week of April. Form 8-K Joby - RTP (Investor's presentation) PF shares outstanding: 660 million The pro forma implied market capitalization of the combined company is $6.6 billion, at the $10.00 per share PIPE subscription price and assuming no public shareholders of Reinvent exercise their redemption rights. The Company will receive at the time of transaction close up to $690 million in proceeds from Reinvent’s cash in trust and an $835 million private placement of common stock at a $10.00 per share value and will also convert a $75 million convertible note into common stock at a $10.00 per share value. Pro-forma for the transaction, Joby expects to have up to $1.974Bn of cash to fund growth and commercialize its operations Transaction implies a fully diluted pro-forma aggregate value of $4.6Bn (2.3x AV / 2026E Revenue) Existing Joby shareholders to roll 100% of their equity and expected to receive 76% of the pro-forma equity Up to five-year lock-up on founder shares. Major stockholders and key executives of Joby have agreed to enter into separate lockup agreements as well. Price-based vesting triggers of $12, $18, $24, $32 and $50 per share on founder shares The boards of directors of both Reinvent and Joby have unanimously approved the transaction, which is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2021. Form 8-K What Blade/ EXPC and Joby/ RTP Stocks are Worth Blade - EXPC PF shares outstanding: 82.5 million EXPC SP as of 03/14: $12.9 SPAC Cash = $375MM 82.5MM * $12.9/share = 1.064Bn PF Market Cap PF EV is = $689MM (PF Market Cap - SPAC Cash) Disruptive technology platforms have an average EV-sales ratio of 8.2x. In addition, luxury brands are at 7.5x and recent EV / SPAC mobility deals have averaged 6.5x. The average of all four of these groups of stocks is 7.4x. On page 37 of the presentation, Blade shows the EV-sales ratios of four groups of its peers. Unadjusted: 2024 estimated revenue is expected to be $402MM (Blade isn't accounting any eVTOL revenue, international expansion, operational upside or any strategic upside in this number). This means that the unadjusted EV-sales ratio for 2024 is 1.71x sales. That is very low. This means that at 7.4x $402 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $2.975 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is $3.35 billion. That is 215% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion. Unadjusted fair share price: 3.35Bn/82.5M = $40.61 Adjusted: We need to adjust the 2024 numbers to derive their present value. At a 15% discount rate for 4 years, the 2024 sales are worth 57.175% of this in today’s dollars. The present value sales number is $230 million (i.e., $402 million times 57.175%). As a result, the adjusted EV-sales multiple is 3x (i.e., $689 million EV divided by $230 million). This means that at 7.4x $230 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $1.702 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is $2.077 billion. That is 95.2% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion. Adjusted fair share price: 2.077Bn/82.5M = $25.2 Average between adjusted and unadjusted: Target market value is $2.713 billion. Fair share price: $32.89 Conclusion: EXPC stock is worth at least 154% more than its present price of $12.9 (As of 03/14/2021) This is without accounting all the hype from the merger announcement. Joby - RTP (Speculation) It's difficult to value this stock since all the revenue projections are subject to a lot of variables (Timely certification, customer acquisition, production delays, etc.) Yet, I am long term bullish on this stock. With almost $2 billion in capital on-hand, the Elevate team, and Toyota as a manufacturing partner, Bevirt’s company has everything it needs to achieve his vision of saving a billion people an hour a day. Check Ehang (Chinese competitor) stock's trajectory over past 6 months. Clear that there's a lot of excitement surrounding eVTOLs and the news of merger should send this stock soaring in next few months. ARKX ETF is slated to launch end of this month and RTP is a great match for Cathie Wood's sub-orbital space category. How I am playing EXPC and RTP Catalysts: ARKX ETF launch EOM makes both EXPC and RTP a great spec play EXPC - A lot of spec predictions floating around about the shareholder vote on 3/31 Post NASDAQ sell-off was brutal for all SPACs and especially EXPC and RTP but these stocks are bound to rebound. Positions: 30 calls for 05/21 at $20 strike price, 18 calls for 8/20 at $25 strike price. I am tempted to pick up 04/16 $30 calls tomorrow. I don't have any RTP shares/calls but I might pick up a few calls tomorrow as well. Note that I am only playing catalysts at this point but may buy shares for RTP for long term investment (>5years). I find advent of eVTOLs super exciting. Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, heck this is my first time writing a DD so what do I even know about investing. Do your own DD and most importantly, let me know if I've got any part of the thesis glaringly wrong.

I like the long term potential of EVTOL more than electric cars since I believe there will be far better moats here with a lot less competition. Also has some potential for future crossover with defense industry.Not saying I would go whole hog on this, but I picked up some warrants as a speculative play on RTX after the SPAC shares crashed back to being close to the initial $10 value. In my view, the long-term warrants (expire in 2027) present an opportunity for a LOT of upside, where the downside is not necessarily that high.In other words, I think that right now, the risk assymetry is heavily skewed to the upside.That being said, unless WSB catches onto hype in this sector, I'm not sure I would want to play these short term. I would not buy options on these here personally. Overall, I think the macro headwinds to growth stocks is going to be a little bit tough over the next few quarters. It'll probably help that these are small caps, but I still think these are best viewed as speculative long term call options on a potential new disruptive technology.",0,0.541,NEGATIVE,0.978
,"Tl;dr: EXPC stock is worth at least 154% more than its present price of $12.9 (As of 03/14/2021). Both EXPC and RTP have significant catalysts lined up ahead that will likely boost the SP from current lows post-NASDAQ sell-off. What to expect Understanding the eVTOL Space Outlook for EXPC and RTP SPAC Transaction Summary What Blade/ EXPC and Joby/ RTP Stocks are Worth How I am playing EXPC and RTP Useful Links Understanding the eVTOL Space (Note: Skip to next section if you feel reading this background info is a drag) Before I even start discussing tickers and plays, I'd first like to shed some light on the groundbreaking Urban Air Mobility (UAM) space, where it's heading and who are the top players vying for the bigger piece of the pie. Understanding the potential investment opportunities without understanding this nascent space is a mooo point. Electric VTOL (Vertical Take off & Landing) air taxis are one of the great emerging technologies of our time, promising to unlock the skies as traffic-free, high-speed, 3D commuting routes. Much quieter and cheaper than helicopter travel, they'll also run on zero-local-emission electric power, and many models suggest they'll cost around the same per mile as a ground-based ride share. Currently there are over 100 players around the globe (check this article to get an overview of some the key players in the eVTOL space) in various stages of designing, building and commercializing eVTOL airframes. As is the case with any disruptive industry, the development and production of eVTOLs is an insanely cash hungry undertaking. Currently, we've a handful of frontrunners around the world who have gone public (Chinese eVTOL $EH) or are ripe to go public soon. Here's a the link to a well rounded DD comparing RTP-ACIC-EXPC-EH-Volo-Lilium that I highly recommend checking out. The United States is acutely aware that it 'missed the boat' on consumer drones, and it's an understandably sore point. But perhaps more importantly the geopolitical consequences of Chinese drone dominance appear to have reverberated around the corridors of the Pentagon for some time. One consequence of this situation is that the latest area of rapid aerospace innovation - eVTOL - has firmly captured the attention of US industry, investors and now the Department of Defense. Leaders of all stripes Stateside are determined that America will indeed be 'first' in this new and exciting area of aerospace innovation. The Air Force recently launched Agility Prime, a non-traditional program seeking to accelerate the commercial market for advanced air mobility vehicles (i.e., ""flying cars""). Check their website here and highly recommend reading this Wired article by USAF's former Acquisition Executive, Will Roper who starts his argument by drawing inspiration from the Jetsons. The outlook for UAM looks positive based on increasing congestion in cities. There are various estimates of the TAM (total addressable market) of UAM. In its presentation, Archer Aviation said that it expects a TAM of $1.5 trillion for UAM, which stretches to $3 trillion in the optimistic scenario. Joby Aviation said that it sees the TAM for UAM at $1 trillion globally and $500 billion in the U.S. Joby Aviation cited the 2018 UAM Market Study from Booz Allen Hamilton for its forecasts. Now, What's stopping us from having eVTOL air taxis today, then? Here are some of the factors you should be considering while evaluating potential investment opportunities: Batteries!! - Battery manufacturers' roadmaps are currently focused on satiating EV manufacturers and developing battery packs with required energy density and specific power (i.e. ability to sustain Tesla's ludicrous mode for a few minutes v/s a few seconds) could take a few years. Alakai Skai's (currently supported by a single private investor) decision however, to ditch lithium batteries for a liquid hydrogen powertrain completely eliminates the battery technology bottleneck that almost every other company is hoping will resolve itself by the time they launch commercial services Certification - These are entirely new categories of aircraft, and the process of certifying, testing and regulating them is going to be monstrously expensive and time consuming. Federal support and urgency to outcompete global players should help the cause. Safety - To coordinate their thrust, each of the electric motor and fan units will need reliable sensors to accurately measure pressure, temperature and other indicators. Each of the motors will induce vibrations in the wings, and their fans may not all spin with the same efficiencies as wear and tear set in. It will be complicated to write software to reliably control all that, says Ella Atkins, an aerospace engineering professor at the University of Michigan. While Atkins says she doesn’t see anything that’s “absolutely a showstopper” with the design, she thinks the many years it took to solve the deadly control problems of the first tiltrotor aircraft, the U.S. military’s V-22 Osprey, offers a sobering parallel for Lilium and other EVTOL developers. “You need a lot of money and time to be successful in aerospace, and the truth is, this industry is trying to go too fast,” says Atkins. Next issue is use of ballistic parachutes. Ballistic parachutes can only save you above a certain altitude, maybe 120 feet or so. Below that, they don't have time to open up, which means that every time you take off or land in one of these machines, you're exposed to a window of time in which total system failure would drop you like a stone. Air Traffic Control - Down the track, there will also have to be a considerable leap forward in air traffic control if the skies are going to safely hold large numbers of these machines zipping about between a bunch of skyports/ vertiports dotted around an urban area. Public Perception - Public perception (trust and safety in tech) is a large obstacle. Safety is the greatest concern with “unruly” passengers, “lasing” of pilots, and aircraft sabotage being main contributors. New importance of travel time, increase in telecommuting, urbanization and de-congestion scenarios could reduce the viability of UAM markets. Advancement in driverless car tech will likely make UAMs suitable for long-distance commute only. All these problems are being worked on, and now we are ready to discuss 2 important SPAC plays that I have rounded up for investment in this space: Joby Aviation - $RTP (eVTOL Manufacturer | Long term play) Blade - $EXPC (eVTOL Asset Light Platform, aka 'Uber of skies'| Short-Mid term play) Outlook for EXPC and RTP Blade - EXPC Investor's presentation Blade is an eVTOL index play, often thought as the ""Uber of skies"" operates by connecting contract pilots with passengers to generate revenue via their proprietary platform. Blade’s business model is proven and is profitable; eVTOL is expected to improve unit economics and dramatically expand the addressable market of BLADE’s existing products. There are currently 167 different eVTOL aircraft under development. Blade is 1 of 1 asset light platform — poised to benefit regardless of which eVTOL manufacturer is first to market. Basically, Blade's strategy is akin to selling shovels in a gold rush. Rob Wiesenthal, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Blade, commented, “Ground mobility has been radically transformed by software and battery technology, as evidenced by the rapid adoption of electric vehicles. The next battle is in the air. This transaction provides the capital for Blade to profitably expand its urban air mobility business using conventional rotorcraft today, while providing a seamless transition to EVA aircraft tomorrow.” Blade and KSL have already identified around $300 million in short- to mid-term investment opportunities that will help Blade expand its presence in the northeastern United States, on the West Coast in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and in new markets that could include Vancouver, Jakarta, and Tokyo. (EXPC is sponsored by an affiliate of KSL Capital Partners, making the EXPC<>Blade strategic merger even more prudent). Blade operates in four key lines of business: Short Distance – Flights between 60 and 100 miles in distance, primarily servicing commuters for prices between $595 and $795 per seat (or $295 for monthly commuter pass holders). BLADE Airport – Flights between all New York area airports and dedicated Blade lounges in Manhattan’s heliports. Prices start at $195 per seat (or $95 per seat with the purchase of an annual Airport Pass)1 . BLADE MediMobility – Blade is the largest transporter of human organs in the Northeast United States, reducing the costs and transport time for hospitals versus legacy competitors. This business is a critical part of the Company’s growth strategy as organ movements are expected to be one of the first uses of EVA, before flights for passengers. International Joint Ventures – As part of its expansion strategy, the Company forms joint ventures with local partners in key overseas markets to provide the technology, customer experience, infrastructure design, and employee training, that enables a scalable and consistent Blade experience. Blade’s first international joint venture launched helicopter services late last year in India flying between Mumbai, Pune, and Shirdi. The Company expects to use proceeds from the transaction to fund expansion into new markets, including the Northeast Corridor and West Coast in the United States, as well as target addressable markets internationally (Vancouver, Jakarta and Tokyo). Blade's projected revenue outlook: Blade estimates its revenue in 2021 will reach $52 million. Moreover, by 2023, Blade estimates revenue will reach $181 million and $402 million by the end of 2024. This is all still before significant revenues occur from eVTOL which the company calls Phase 3 starting in 2025 and 2026. It does not assume any passenger eVTOL revenue before then. But in Phase 3, revenue is forecast to skyrocket to $601 million in 2025 and $875 million in 2026. (These numbers should be considered with a grain of salt) Blade's Competitive Moat: BLADE’s first mover advantage, extensive and loyal customer base and control of strategic infrastructure secures its leading position in the future of urban air mobility. #1 market share in key short-distance aviation markets, brings credibility to new market expansion. Strong management team with domain expertise and public market experience. BLADE is already slated to leverage and partner with KSL’s portfolio companies to generate attractive growth opportunities. Proprietary technologies and asset-light model enables flight volume growth and accelerates launch timeline for new markets While Joby Aviation - Uber partnership pose a significant competitive threat, it's worth noting that Uber Elevate failed to take off even with its branding and it'll be challenging for Joby to front the customer acquisition cost (after bleeding dry with production upscaling and certification costs) and outcompete Blade who have an edge in that domain with their ever growing loyal customer base. Another point to note is that Joby will be limited to their own aircrafts while Blade is already scanning potential players and will likely partner with different eVTOL operators depending on the nature of routes. ARKQ is holding 2,748,457 shares, which represents 9.99% of public float for EXPC. Once the merger is complete, there will be a total of 82.5M shares.

In addition, luxury brands are at 7.5x and recent EV / SPAC mobility deals have averaged 6.5x. The average of all four of these groups of stocks is 7.4x. On page 37 of the presentation, Blade shows the EV-sales ratios of four groups of its peers. Unadjusted: 2024 estimated revenue is expected to be $402MM (Blade isn't accounting any eVTOL revenue, international expansion, operational upside or any strategic upside in this number). This means that the unadjusted EV-sales ratio for 2024 is 1.71x sales. That is very low. This means that at 7.4x $402 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $2.975 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is $3.35 billion. That is 215% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion. Unadjusted fair share price: 3.35Bn/82.5M = $40.61 Adjusted: We need to adjust the 2024 numbers to derive their present value. At a 15% discount rate for 4 years, the 2024 sales are worth 57.175% of this in today’s dollars. The present value sales number is $230 million (i.e., $402 million times 57.175%). As a result, the adjusted EV-sales multiple is 3x (i.e., $689 million EV divided by $230 million). This means that at 7.4x $230 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $1.702 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is $2.077 billion. That is 95.2% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion. Adjusted fair share price: 2.077Bn/82.5M = $25.2 Average between adjusted and unadjusted: Target market value is $2.713 billion. Fair share price: $32.89 Conclusion: EXPC stock is worth at least 154% more than its present price of $12.9 (As of 03/14/2021) This is without accounting all the hype from the merger announcement. Joby - RTP (Speculation) It's difficult to value this stock since all the revenue projections are subject to a lot of variables (Timely certification, customer acquisition, production delays, etc.) Yet, I am long term bullish on this stock.

There're a ton of studies validating the 1T+ eVTOL global market in next few years and as I said above, I'm long term bullish on Joby but it'll take strong conviction to hold these stocks over a long time and through a ton of turbulence (no pun intended) as the acceptance for this nascent industry grows. The fact that the hype mania hasn't caught up to this sector makes me even more optimistic. Hopefully we'll see a significant number of new investors looking for the next shiny thing once the EV and GME hype dies down.My short term play for EXPC is based on how fundamentally undervalued it is and the catalysts lined up ahead. More importantly, ARKX is about to launch soon and I think both EXPC and RTP hits the bullseye when it comes to the sub-orbital category delineated by Cathie for the space ETF. Joby was also named one of the most innovative companies of 2020 by FastCompany mag. You're absolutely right about the WSB factor though.

,"Tl;dr: EXPC stock is worth at least 154% more than its present price of $12.9 (As of 03/14/2021). Both EXPC and RTP have significant catalysts lined up ahead that will likely boost the SP from current lows post-NASDAQ sell-off. What to expect Understanding the eVTOL Space Outlook for EXPC and RTP SPAC Transaction Summary What Blade/ EXPC and Joby/ RTP Stocks are Worth How I am playing EXPC and RTP Useful Links Understanding the eVTOL Space (Note: Skip to next section if you feel reading this background info is a drag) Before I even start discussing tickers and plays, I'd first like to shed some light on the groundbreaking Urban Air Mobility (UAM) space, where it's heading and who are the top players vying for the bigger piece of the pie. Understanding the potential investment opportunities without understanding this nascent space is a mooo point. Electric VTOL (Vertical Take off & Landing) air taxis are one of the great emerging technologies of our time, promising to unlock the skies as traffic-free, high-speed, 3D commuting routes. Much quieter and cheaper than helicopter travel, they'll also run on zero-local-emission electric power, and many models suggest they'll cost around the same per mile as a ground-based ride share. Currently there are over 100 players around the globe (check this article to get an overview of some the key players in the eVTOL space) in various stages of designing, building and commercializing eVTOL airframes. As is the case with any disruptive industry, the development and production of eVTOLs is an insanely cash hungry undertaking. Currently, we've a handful of frontrunners around the world who have gone public (Chinese eVTOL $EH) or are ripe to go public soon. Here's a the link to a well rounded DD comparing RTP-ACIC-EXPC-EH-Volo-Lilium that I highly recommend checking out. The United States is acutely aware that it 'missed the boat' on consumer drones, and it's an understandably sore point. But perhaps more importantly the geopolitical consequences of Chinese drone dominance appear to have reverberated around the corridors of the Pentagon for some time. One consequence of this situation is that the latest area of rapid aerospace innovation - eVTOL - has firmly captured the attention of US industry, investors and now the Department of Defense. Leaders of all stripes Stateside are determined that America will indeed be 'first' in this new and exciting area of aerospace innovation. The Air Force recently launched Agility Prime, a non-traditional program seeking to accelerate the commercial market for advanced air mobility vehicles (i.e., ""flying cars""). Check their website here and highly recommend reading this Wired article by USAF's former Acquisition Executive, Will Roper who starts his argument by drawing inspiration from the Jetsons. The outlook for UAM looks positive based on increasing congestion in cities. There are various estimates of the TAM (total addressable market) of UAM. In its presentation, Archer Aviation said that it expects a TAM of $1.5 trillion for UAM, which stretches to $3 trillion in the optimistic scenario. Joby Aviation said that it sees the TAM for UAM at $1 trillion globally and $500 billion in the U.S. Joby Aviation cited the 2018 UAM Market Study from Booz Allen Hamilton for its forecasts. Now, What's stopping us from having eVTOL air taxis today, then? Here are some of the factors you should be considering while evaluating potential investment opportunities: Batteries!! - Battery manufacturers' roadmaps are currently focused on satiating EV manufacturers and developing battery packs with required energy density and specific power (i.e. ability to sustain Tesla's ludicrous mode for a few minutes v/s a few seconds) could take a few years. Alakai Skai's (currently supported by a single private investor) decision however, to ditch lithium batteries for a liquid hydrogen powertrain completely eliminates the battery technology bottleneck that almost every other company is hoping will resolve itself by the time they launch commercial services Certification - These are entirely new categories of aircraft, and the process of certifying, testing and regulating them is going to be monstrously expensive and time consuming. Federal support and urgency to outcompete global players should help the cause. Safety - To coordinate their thrust, each of the electric motor and fan units will need reliable sensors to accurately measure pressure, temperature and other indicators. Each of the motors will induce vibrations in the wings, and their fans may not all spin with the same efficiencies as wear and tear set in. It will be complicated to write software to reliably control all that, says Ella Atkins, an aerospace engineering professor at the University of Michigan. While Atkins says she doesn’t see anything that’s “absolutely a showstopper” with the design, she thinks the many years it took to solve the deadly control problems of the first tiltrotor aircraft, the U.S. military’s V-22 Osprey, offers a sobering parallel for Lilium and other EVTOL developers. “You need a lot of money and time to be successful in aerospace, and the truth is, this industry is trying to go too fast,” says Atkins. Next issue is use of ballistic parachutes. Ballistic parachutes can only save you above a certain altitude, maybe 120 feet or so. Below that, they don't have time to open up, which means that every time you take off or land in one of these machines, you're exposed to a window of time in which total system failure would drop you like a stone. Air Traffic Control - Down the track, there will also have to be a considerable leap forward in air traffic control if the skies are going to safely hold large numbers of these machines zipping about between a bunch of skyports/ vertiports dotted around an urban area. Public Perception - Public perception (trust and safety in tech) is a large obstacle. Safety is the greatest concern with “unruly” passengers, “lasing” of pilots, and aircraft sabotage being main contributors. New importance of travel time, increase in telecommuting, urbanization and de-congestion scenarios could reduce the viability of UAM markets. Advancement in driverless car tech will likely make UAMs suitable for long-distance commute only. All these problems are being worked on, and now we are ready to discuss 2 important SPAC plays that I have rounded up for investment in this space: Joby Aviation - $RTP (eVTOL Manufacturer | Long term play) Blade - $EXPC (eVTOL Asset Light Platform, aka 'Uber of skies'| Short-Mid term play) Outlook for EXPC and RTP Blade - EXPC Investor's presentation Blade is an eVTOL index play, often thought as the ""Uber of skies"" operates by connecting contract pilots with passengers to generate revenue via their proprietary platform. Blade’s business model is proven and is profitable; eVTOL is expected to improve unit economics and dramatically expand the addressable market of BLADE’s existing products. There are currently 167 different eVTOL aircraft under development. Blade is 1 of 1 asset light platform — poised to benefit regardless of which eVTOL manufacturer is first to market. Basically, Blade's strategy is akin to selling shovels in a gold rush. Rob Wiesenthal, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Blade, commented, “Ground mobility has been radically transformed by software and battery technology, as evidenced by the rapid adoption of electric vehicles. The next battle is in the air. This transaction provides the capital for Blade to profitably expand its urban air mobility business using conventional rotorcraft today, while providing a seamless transition to EVA aircraft tomorrow.” Blade and KSL have already identified around $300 million in short- to mid-term investment opportunities that will help Blade expand its presence in the northeastern United States, on the West Coast in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and in new markets that could include Vancouver, Jakarta, and Tokyo. (EXPC is sponsored by an affiliate of KSL Capital Partners, making the EXPC<>Blade strategic merger even more prudent). Blade operates in four key lines of business: Short Distance – Flights between 60 and 100 miles in distance, primarily servicing commuters for prices between $595 and $795 per seat (or $295 for monthly commuter pass holders). BLADE Airport – Flights between all New York area airports and dedicated Blade lounges in Manhattan’s heliports. Prices start at $195 per seat (or $95 per seat with the purchase of an annual Airport Pass)1 . BLADE MediMobility – Blade is the largest transporter of human organs in the Northeast United States, reducing the costs and transport time for hospitals versus legacy competitors. This business is a critical part of the Company’s growth strategy as organ movements are expected to be one of the first uses of EVA, before flights for passengers. International Joint Ventures – As part of its expansion strategy, the Company forms joint ventures with local partners in key overseas markets to provide the technology, customer experience, infrastructure design, and employee training, that enables a scalable and consistent Blade experience. Blade’s first international joint venture launched helicopter services late last year in India flying between Mumbai, Pune, and Shirdi. The Company expects to use proceeds from the transaction to fund expansion into new markets, including the Northeast Corridor and West Coast in the United States, as well as target addressable markets internationally (Vancouver, Jakarta and Tokyo). Blade's projected revenue outlook: Blade estimates its revenue in 2021 will reach $52 million. Moreover, by 2023, Blade estimates revenue will reach $181 million and $402 million by the end of 2024. This is all still before significant revenues occur from eVTOL which the company calls Phase 3 starting in 2025 and 2026. It does not assume any passenger eVTOL revenue before then. But in Phase 3, revenue is forecast to skyrocket to $601 million in 2025 and $875 million in 2026. (These numbers should be considered with a grain of salt) Blade's Competitive Moat: BLADE’s first mover advantage, extensive and loyal customer base and control of strategic infrastructure secures its leading position in the future of urban air mobility. #1 market share in key short-distance aviation markets, brings credibility to new market expansion. Strong management team with domain expertise and public market experience. BLADE is already slated to leverage and partner with KSL’s portfolio companies to generate attractive growth opportunities. Proprietary technologies and asset-light model enables flight volume growth and accelerates launch timeline for new markets While Joby Aviation - Uber partnership pose a significant competitive threat, it's worth noting that Uber Elevate failed to take off even with its branding and it'll be challenging for Joby to front the customer acquisition cost (after bleeding dry with production upscaling and certification costs) and outcompete Blade who have an edge in that domain with their ever growing loyal customer base. Another point to note is that Joby will be limited to their own aircrafts while Blade is already scanning potential players and will likely partner with different eVTOL operators depending on the nature of routes. ARKQ is holding 2,748,457 shares, which represents 9.99% of public float for EXPC. Once the merger is complete, there will be a total of 82.5M shares. This means ARK currently own 2.9% of the 82.5M shares. Leadership: Upon completion of the transaction, the combined company will continue to be led by Mr. Wiesenthal as Chief Executive Officer. The senior management team will also include Will Heyburn, Chief Financial Officer and Head of Corporate Development, Brandon Keene, Chief Technology Officer, and Melissa Tomkiel, General Counsel.

Understanding the potential investment opportunities without understanding this nascent space is a mooo point. Electric VTOL (Vertical Take off & Landing) air taxis are one of the great emerging technologies of our time, promising to unlock the skies as traffic-free, high-speed, 3D commuting routes. Much quieter and cheaper than helicopter travel, they'll also run on zero-local-emission electric power, and many models suggest they'll cost around the same per mile as a ground-based ride share. Currently there are over 100 players around the globe (check this article to get an overview of some the key players in the eVTOL space) in various stages of designing, building and commercializing eVTOL airframes. As is the case with any disruptive industry, the development and production of eVTOLs is an insanely cash hungry undertaking. Currently, we've a handful of frontrunners around the world who have gone public (Chinese eVTOL $EH) or are ripe to go public soon. Here's a the link to a well rounded DD comparing RTP-ACIC-EXPC-EH-Volo-Lilium that I highly recommend checking out. The United States is acutely aware that it 'missed the boat' on consumer drones, and it's an understandably sore point. But perhaps more importantly the geopolitical consequences of Chinese drone dominance appear to have reverberated around the corridors of the Pentagon for some time. One consequence of this situation is that the latest area of rapid aerospace innovation - eVTOL - has firmly captured the attention of US industry, investors and now the Department of Defense. Leaders of all stripes Stateside are determined that America will indeed be 'first' in this new and exciting area of aerospace innovation. The Air Force recently launched Agility Prime, a non-traditional program seeking to accelerate the commercial market for advanced air mobility vehicles (i.e., ""flying cars""). Check their website here and highly recommend reading this Wired article by USAF's former Acquisition Executive, Will Roper who starts his argument by drawing inspiration from the Jetsons. The outlook for UAM looks positive based on increasing congestion in cities. There are various estimates of the TAM (total addressable market) of UAM. In its presentation, Archer Aviation said that it expects a TAM of $1.5 trillion for UAM, which stretches to $3 trillion in the optimistic scenario. Joby Aviation said that it sees the TAM for UAM at $1 trillion globally and $500 billion in the U.S. Joby Aviation cited the 2018 UAM Market Study from Booz Allen Hamilton for its forecasts. Now, What's stopping us from having eVTOL air taxis today, then? Here are some of the factors you should be considering while evaluating potential investment opportunities: Batteries!! - Battery manufacturers' roadmaps are currently focused on satiating EV manufacturers and developing battery packs with required energy density and specific power (i.e. ability to sustain Tesla's ludicrous mode for a few minutes v/s a few seconds) could take a few years. Alakai Skai's (currently supported by a single private investor) decision however, to ditch lithium batteries for a liquid hydrogen powertrain completely eliminates the battery technology bottleneck that almost every other company is hoping will resolve itself by the time they launch commercial services Certification - These are entirely new categories of aircraft, and the process of certifying, testing and regulating them is going to be monstrously expensive and time consuming. Federal support and urgency to outcompete global players should help the cause. Safety - To coordinate their thrust, each of the electric motor and fan units will need reliable sensors to accurately measure pressure, temperature and other indicators. Each of the motors will induce vibrations in the wings, and their fans may not all spin with the same efficiencies as wear and tear set in. It will be complicated to write software to reliably control all that, says Ella Atkins, an aerospace engineering professor at the University of Michigan. While Atkins says she doesn’t see anything that’s “absolutely a showstopper” with the design, she thinks the many years it took to solve the deadly control problems of the first tiltrotor aircraft, the U.S. military’s V-22 Osprey, offers a sobering parallel for Lilium and other EVTOL developers. “You need a lot of money and time to be successful in aerospace, and the truth is, this industry is trying to go too fast,” says Atkins. Next issue is use of ballistic parachutes. Ballistic parachutes can only save you above a certain altitude, maybe 120 feet or so. Below that, they don't have time to open up, which means that every time you take off or land in one of these machines, you're exposed to a window of time in which total system failure would drop you like a stone. Air Traffic Control - Down the track, there will also have to be a considerable leap forward in air traffic control if the skies are going to safely hold large numbers of these machines zipping about between a bunch of skyports/ vertiports dotted around an urban area. Public Perception - Public perception (trust and safety in tech) is a large obstacle. Safety is the greatest concern with “unruly” passengers, “lasing” of pilots, and aircraft sabotage being main contributors. New importance of travel time, increase in telecommuting, urbanization and de-congestion scenarios could reduce the viability of UAM markets. Advancement in driverless car tech will likely make UAMs suitable for long-distance commute only. All these problems are being worked on, and now we are ready to discuss 2 important SPAC plays that I have rounded up for investment in this space: Joby Aviation - $RTP (eVTOL Manufacturer | Long term play) Blade - $EXPC (eVTOL Asset Light Platform, aka 'Uber of skies'| Short-Mid term play) Outlook for EXPC and RTP Blade - EXPC Investor's presentation Blade is an eVTOL index play, often thought as the ""Uber of skies"" operates by connecting contract pilots with passengers to generate revenue via their proprietary platform. Blade’s business model is proven and is profitable; eVTOL is expected to improve unit economics and dramatically expand the addressable market of BLADE’s existing products. There are currently 167 different eVTOL aircraft under development. Blade is 1 of 1 asset light platform — poised to benefit regardless of which eVTOL manufacturer is first to market. Basically, Blade's strategy is akin to selling shovels in a gold rush. Rob Wiesenthal, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Blade, commented, “Ground mobility has been radically transformed by software and battery technology, as evidenced by the rapid adoption of electric vehicles. The next battle is in the air. This transaction provides the capital for Blade to profitably expand its urban air mobility business using conventional rotorcraft today, while providing a seamless transition to EVA aircraft tomorrow.” Blade and KSL have already identified around $300 million in short- to mid-term investment opportunities that will help Blade expand its presence in the northeastern United States, on the West Coast in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and in new markets that could include Vancouver, Jakarta, and Tokyo. (EXPC is sponsored by an affiliate of KSL Capital Partners, making the EXPC<>Blade strategic merger even more prudent). Blade operates in four key lines of business: Short Distance – Flights between 60 and 100 miles in distance, primarily servicing commuters for prices between $595 and $795 per seat (or $295 for monthly commuter pass holders). BLADE Airport – Flights between all New York area airports and dedicated Blade lounges in Manhattan’s heliports. Prices start at $195 per seat (or $95 per seat with the purchase of an annual Airport Pass)1 . BLADE MediMobility – Blade is the largest transporter of human organs in the Northeast United States, reducing the costs and transport time for hospitals versus legacy competitors. This business is a critical part of the Company’s growth strategy as organ movements are expected to be one of the first uses of EVA, before flights for passengers. International Joint Ventures – As part of its expansion strategy, the Company forms joint ventures with local partners in key overseas markets to provide the technology, customer experience, infrastructure design, and employee training, that enables a scalable and consistent Blade experience. Blade’s first international joint venture launched helicopter services late last year in India flying between Mumbai, Pune, and Shirdi. The Company expects to use proceeds from the transaction to fund expansion into new markets, including the Northeast Corridor and West Coast in the United States, as well as target addressable markets internationally (Vancouver, Jakarta and Tokyo). Blade's projected revenue outlook: Blade estimates its revenue in 2021 will reach $52 million. Moreover, by 2023, Blade estimates revenue will reach $181 million and $402 million by the end of 2024. This is all still before significant revenues occur from eVTOL which the company calls Phase 3 starting in 2025 and 2026. It does not assume any passenger eVTOL revenue before then. But in Phase 3, revenue is forecast to skyrocket to $601 million in 2025 and $875 million in 2026. (These numbers should be considered with a grain of salt) Blade's Competitive Moat: BLADE’s first mover advantage, extensive and loyal customer base and control of strategic infrastructure secures its leading position in the future of urban air mobility. #1 market share in key short-distance aviation markets, brings credibility to new market expansion. Strong management team with domain expertise and public market experience. BLADE is already slated to leverage and partner with KSL’s portfolio companies to generate attractive growth opportunities. Proprietary technologies and asset-light model enables flight volume growth and accelerates launch timeline for new markets While Joby Aviation - Uber partnership pose a significant competitive threat, it's worth noting that Uber Elevate failed to take off even with its branding and it'll be challenging for Joby to front the customer acquisition cost (after bleeding dry with production upscaling and certification costs) and outcompete Blade who have an edge in that domain with their ever growing loyal customer base. Another point to note is that Joby will be limited to their own aircrafts while Blade is already scanning potential players and will likely partner with different eVTOL operators depending on the nature of routes. ARKQ is holding 2,748,457 shares, which represents 9.99% of public float for EXPC. Once the merger is complete, there will be a total of 82.5M shares. This means ARK currently own 2.9% of the 82.5M shares. Leadership: Upon completion of the transaction, the combined company will continue to be led by Mr. Wiesenthal as Chief Executive Officer. The senior management team will also include Will Heyburn, Chief Financial Officer and Head of Corporate Development, Brandon Keene, Chief Technology Officer, and Melissa Tomkiel, General Counsel.

Joby Aviation - RTP Investor's presentation Fact Sheet Company has spent more than a decade developing piloted, all-electric, vertical takeoff and landing passenger aircraft, with over 1,000 test flights conducted to date. Intends to operate clean, quiet and affordable air taxi service starting in 2024; with a vision to offer flights at the same price as a ground-based taxi. First company to agree certification basis for an eVTOL aircraft with FAA First company to be granted airworthiness approval for an eVTOL aircraft by U.S. Air Force Company has strategic partnership with Toyota for production and recently acquired Uber Elevate and will be partnering with Uber for go-to-market and demand generation. Other partners include: Agility Prime - A USAF program that will provide Joby access to key research facilities and equipment and allows us to prove out the maturity and reliability of our aircraft. Toray - Joby Aviation and Toray Advanced Composites completed a long-term supply agreement for the composite material used for Joby’s aircraft. Garmin - Garmin will be providing their state-of-the-art G3000 integrated flight deck to Joby for our aircraft. The G3000 integrated flight deck has been reliably demonstrated across a variety of aircraft and brings seamless integration for the unique requirements of eVTOL aircraft. In 10 years, Joby’s presentation to investors projects a presence in over 20 cities worldwide with 14,000 aircraft in service generating more than $20 billion in revenue — electric air mobility at scale around the world. Up to five-year lock-up agreement and price-based vesting on certain sponsor shares ensures unprecedented long-term alignment, with some shares not vesting until Company achieves $30 billion market capitalization. Proceeds are expected to fund Company through start of passenger service launch, including certification of aircraft and development of manufacturing facilities. Joby's Competitive Moat: Expect to be first to market with the right aircraft 4 passenger aircraft to optimize unit economics Significant progress in certification Well developed go-to-market strategy enhanced through Uber Elevate acquisition World class engineering and certification team FAA Part 23 general aviation certification enables global reach Leadership: JoeBen Bevirt; Founder and Chief Executive Officer Paul Sciarra; Executive Chairman Matt Field; Chief Financial Officer (ex-CFO, North America, at Ford Motor Company, Prior to joining Ford, he worked at Goldman Sachs and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.)

Latham & Watkins LLP served as legal advisor and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Allen & Company LLC served as financial advisors to Joby. SPAC Transaction Summary Blade - EXPC (Investor's presentation) The transaction will be funded by a combination of EIC ($EXPC) cash held in a trust account and proceeds from a $125m PIPE, of which KSL has committed to subscribing for ~$20m PF shares outstanding: 82.5 million Transaction reflects pro forma market capitalization of $1.604 billion (The share price as I'm writing this is $12.9) Transaction will result in $375m of cash to balance sheet to fund growth Transaction implies a fully diluted pro forma equity value of $689.25m for Blade Existing Blade shareholders expected to receive 43.2% of the pro forma equity The boards of directors of both Blade and Experience Investment Corp. have unanimously approved the proposed transaction. The transaction is expected to close in 1H 2021; predictions expect voting to happen in the last week of March/first week of April. Form 8-K Joby - RTP (Investor's presentation) PF shares outstanding: 660 million The pro forma implied market capitalization of the combined company is $6.6 billion, at the $10.00 per share PIPE subscription price and assuming no public shareholders of Reinvent exercise their redemption rights. The Company will receive at the time of transaction close up to $690 million in proceeds from Reinvent’s cash in trust and an $835 million private placement of common stock at a $10.00 per share value and will also convert a $75 million convertible note into common stock at a $10.00 per share value. Pro-forma for the transaction, Joby expects to have up to $1.974Bn of cash to fund growth and commercialize its operations Transaction implies a fully diluted pro-forma aggregate value of $4.6Bn (2.3x AV / 2026E Revenue) Existing Joby shareholders to roll 100% of their equity and expected to receive 76% of the pro-forma equity Up to five-year lock-up on founder shares. Major stockholders and key executives of Joby have agreed to enter into separate lockup agreements as well. Price-based vesting triggers of $12, $18, $24, $32 and $50 per share on founder shares The boards of directors of both Reinvent and Joby have unanimously approved the transaction, which is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2021. Form 8-K What Blade/ EXPC and Joby/ RTP Stocks are Worth Blade - EXPC PF shares outstanding: 82.5 million EXPC SP as of 03/14: $12.9 SPAC Cash = $375MM 82.5MM * $12.9/share = 1.064Bn PF Market Cap PF EV is = $689MM (PF Market Cap - SPAC Cash) Disruptive technology platforms have an average EV-sales ratio of 8.2x. In addition, luxury brands are at 7.5x and recent EV / SPAC mobility deals have averaged 6.5x. The average of all four of these groups of stocks is 7.4x. On page 37 of the presentation, Blade shows the EV-sales ratios of four groups of its peers. Unadjusted: 2024 estimated revenue is expected to be $402MM (Blade isn't accounting any eVTOL revenue, international expansion, operational upside or any strategic upside in this number). This means that the unadjusted EV-sales ratio for 2024 is 1.71x sales. That is very low. This means that at 7.4x $402 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $2.975 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is $3.35 billion. That is 215% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion. Unadjusted fair share price: 3.35Bn/82.5M = $40.61 Adjusted: We need to adjust the 2024 numbers to derive their present value. At a 15% discount rate for 4 years, the 2024 sales are worth 57.175% of this in today’s dollars. The present value sales number is $230 million (i.e., $402 million times 57.175%). As a result, the adjusted EV-sales multiple is 3x (i.e., $689 million EV divided by $230 million). This means that at 7.4x $230 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $1.702 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is $2.077 billion. That is 95.2% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion. Adjusted fair share price: 2.077Bn/82.5M = $25.2 Average between adjusted and unadjusted: Target market value is $2.713 billion. Fair share price: $32.89 Conclusion: EXPC stock is worth at least 154% more than its present price of $12.9 (As of 03/14/2021) This is without accounting all the hype from the merger announcement. Joby - RTP (Speculation) It's difficult to value this stock since all the revenue projections are subject to a lot of variables (Timely certification, customer acquisition, production delays, etc.) Yet, I am long term bullish on this stock. With almost $2 billion in capital on-hand, the Elevate team, and Toyota as a manufacturing partner, Bevirt’s company has everything it needs to achieve his vision of saving a billion people an hour a day. Check Ehang (Chinese competitor) stock's trajectory over past 6 months. Clear that there's a lot of excitement surrounding eVTOLs and the news of merger should send this stock soaring in next few months. ARKX ETF is slated to launch end of this month and RTP is a great match for Cathie Wood's sub-orbital space category. How I am playing EXPC and RTP Catalysts: ARKX ETF launch EOM makes both EXPC and RTP a great spec play EXPC - A lot of spec predictions floating around about the shareholder vote on 3/31 Post NASDAQ sell-off was brutal for all SPACs and especially EXPC and RTP but these stocks are bound to rebound. Positions: 30 calls for 05/21 at $20 strike price, 18 calls for 8/20 at $25 strike price. I am tempted to pick up 04/16 $30 calls tomorrow. I don't have any RTP shares/calls but I might pick up a few calls tomorrow as well. Note that I am only playing catalysts at this point but may buy shares for RTP for long term investment (>5years). I find advent of eVTOLs super exciting. Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, heck this is my first time writing a DD so what do I even know about investing.

Joby is definitely my long eVTOL pick, I just think Blade is a great play short-mid term since it's already operational with revenue flow and future revenue doesn't even account the eVTOL upside. Also, I disagree with ""Blade claims to be an EVTOL Co"".. even their investor's presentation positions them as an eVTOL index play. They basically aren't in the competition of building the eVTOL's per se, they'll most likely partner with multiple manufacturers (once they are ready) and create demand for them with Blade's proprietary asset-light platform and strategic partnerships.

SPAC Transaction Summary Blade - EXPC (Investor's presentation) The transaction will be funded by a combination of EIC ($EXPC) cash held in a trust account and proceeds from a $125m PIPE, of which KSL has committed to subscribing for ~$20m PF shares outstanding: 82.5 million Transaction reflects pro forma market capitalization of $1.604 billion (The share price as I'm writing this is $12.9) Transaction will result in $375m of cash to balance sheet to fund growth Transaction implies a fully diluted pro forma equity value of $689.25m for Blade Existing Blade shareholders expected to receive 43.2% of the pro forma equity The boards of directors of both Blade and Experience Investment Corp. have unanimously approved the proposed transaction. The transaction is expected to close in 1H 2021; predictions expect voting to happen in the last week of March/first week of April. Form 8-K Joby - RTP (Investor's presentation) PF shares outstanding: 660 million The pro forma implied market capitalization of the combined company is $6.6 billion, at the $10.00 per share PIPE subscription price and assuming no public shareholders of Reinvent exercise their redemption rights. The Company will receive at the time of transaction close up to $690 million in proceeds from Reinvent’s cash in trust and an $835 million private placement of common stock at a $10.00 per share value and will also convert a $75 million convertible note into common stock at a $10.00 per share value. Pro-forma for the transaction, Joby expects to have up to $1.974Bn of cash to fund growth and commercialize its operations Transaction implies a fully diluted pro-forma aggregate value of $4.6Bn (2.3x AV / 2026E Revenue) Existing Joby shareholders to roll 100% of their equity and expected to receive 76% of the pro-forma equity Up to five-year lock-up on founder shares. Major stockholders and key executives of Joby have agreed to enter into separate lockup agreements as well. Price-based vesting triggers of $12, $18, $24, $32 and $50 per share on founder shares The boards of directors of both Reinvent and Joby have unanimously approved the transaction, which is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2021. Form 8-K What Blade/ EXPC and Joby/ RTP Stocks are Worth Blade - EXPC PF shares outstanding: 82.5 million EXPC SP as of 03/14: $12.9 SPAC Cash = $375MM 82.5MM * $12.9/share = 1.064Bn PF Market Cap PF EV is = $689MM (PF Market Cap - SPAC Cash) Disruptive technology platforms have an average EV-sales ratio of 8.2x. In addition, luxury brands are at 7.5x and recent EV / SPAC mobility deals have averaged 6.5x. The average of all four of these groups of stocks is 7.4x. On page 37 of the presentation, Blade shows the EV-sales ratios of four groups of its peers. Unadjusted: 2024 estimated revenue is expected to be $402MM (Blade isn't accounting any eVTOL revenue, international expansion, operational upside or any strategic upside in this number). This means that the unadjusted EV-sales ratio for 2024 is 1.71x sales. That is very low. This means that at 7.4x $402 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $2.975 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is $3.35 billion. That is 215% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion. Unadjusted fair share price: 3.35Bn/82.5M = $40.61 Adjusted: We need to adjust the 2024 numbers to derive their present value. At a 15% discount rate for 4 years, the 2024 sales are worth 57.175% of this in today’s dollars. The present value sales number is $230 million (i.e., $402 million times 57.175%). As a result, the adjusted EV-sales multiple is 3x (i.e., $689 million EV divided by $230 million). This means that at 7.4x $230 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $1.702 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is $2.077 billion. That is 95.2% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion. Adjusted fair share price: 2.077Bn/82.5M = $25.2 Average between adjusted and unadjusted: Target market value is $2.713 billion. Fair share price: $32.89 Conclusion: EXPC stock is worth at least 154% more than its present price of $12.9 (As of 03/14/2021) This is without accounting all the hype from the merger announcement. Joby - RTP (Speculation) It's difficult to value this stock since all the revenue projections are subject to a lot of variables (Timely certification, customer acquisition, production delays, etc.) Yet, I am long term bullish on this stock. With almost $2 billion in capital on-hand, the Elevate team, and Toyota as a manufacturing partner, Bevirt’s company has everything it needs to achieve his vision of saving a billion people an hour a day. Check Ehang (Chinese competitor) stock's trajectory over past 6 months. Clear that there's a lot of excitement surrounding eVTOLs and the news of merger should send this stock soaring in next few months. ARKX ETF is slated to launch end of this month and RTP is a great match for Cathie Wood's sub-orbital space category. How I am playing EXPC and RTP Catalysts: ARKX ETF launch EOM makes both EXPC and RTP a great spec play EXPC - A lot of spec predictions floating around about the shareholder vote on 3/31 Post NASDAQ sell-off was brutal for all SPACs and especially EXPC and RTP but these stocks are bound to rebound. Positions: 30 calls for 05/21 at $20 strike price, 18 calls for 8/20 at $25 strike price. I am tempted to pick up 04/16 $30 calls tomorrow. I don't have any RTP shares/calls but I might pick up a few calls tomorrow as well. Note that I am only playing catalysts at this point but may buy shares for RTP for long term investment (>5years). I find advent of eVTOLs super exciting. Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, heck this is my first time writing a DD so what do I even know about investing.

,"Tl;dr: EXPC stock is worth at least 154% more than its present price of $12.9 (As of 03/14/2021). Both EXPC and RTP have significant catalysts lined up ahead that will likely boost the SP from current lows post-NASDAQ sell-off. What to expect Understanding the eVTOL Space Outlook for EXPC and RTP SPAC Transaction Summary What Blade/ EXPC and Joby/ RTP Stocks are Worth How I am playing EXPC and RTP Useful Links Understanding the eVTOL Space (Note: Skip to next section if you feel reading this background info is a drag) Before I even start discussing tickers and plays, I'd first like to shed some light on the groundbreaking Urban Air Mobility (UAM) space, where it's heading and who are the top players vying for the bigger piece of the pie. Understanding the potential investment opportunities without understanding this nascent space is a mooo point. Electric VTOL (Vertical Take off & Landing) air taxis are one of the great emerging technologies of our time, promising to unlock the skies as traffic-free, high-speed, 3D commuting routes. Much quieter and cheaper than helicopter travel, they'll also run on zero-local-emission electric power, and many models suggest they'll cost around the same per mile as a ground-based ride share. Currently there are over 100 players around the globe (check this article to get an overview of some the key players in the eVTOL space) in various stages of designing, building and commercializing eVTOL airframes. As is the case with any disruptive industry, the development and production of eVTOLs is an insanely cash hungry undertaking. Currently, we've a handful of frontrunners around the world who have gone public (Chinese eVTOL $EH) or are ripe to go public soon. Here's a the link to a well rounded DD comparing RTP-ACIC-EXPC-EH-Volo-Lilium that I highly recommend checking out. The United States is acutely aware that it 'missed the boat' on consumer drones, and it's an understandably sore point. But perhaps more importantly the geopolitical consequences of Chinese drone dominance appear to have reverberated around the corridors of the Pentagon for some time. One consequence of this situation is that the latest area of rapid aerospace innovation - eVTOL - has firmly captured the attention of US industry, investors and now the Department of Defense. Leaders of all stripes Stateside are determined that America will indeed be 'first' in this new and exciting area of aerospace innovation. The Air Force recently launched Agility Prime, a non-traditional program seeking to accelerate the commercial market for advanced air mobility vehicles (i.e., ""flying cars""). Check their website here and highly recommend reading this Wired article by USAF's former Acquisition Executive, Will Roper who starts his argument by drawing inspiration from the Jetsons. The outlook for UAM looks positive based on increasing congestion in cities. There are various estimates of the TAM (total addressable market) of UAM. In its presentation, Archer Aviation said that it expects a TAM of $1.5 trillion for UAM, which stretches to $3 trillion in the optimistic scenario. Joby Aviation said that it sees the TAM for UAM at $1 trillion globally and $500 billion in the U.S. Joby Aviation cited the 2018 UAM Market Study from Booz Allen Hamilton for its forecasts. Now, What's stopping us from having eVTOL air taxis today, then? Here are some of the factors you should be considering while evaluating potential investment opportunities: Batteries!! - Battery manufacturers' roadmaps are currently focused on satiating EV manufacturers and developing battery packs with required energy density and specific power (i.e. ability to sustain Tesla's ludicrous mode for a few minutes v/s a few seconds) could take a few years. Alakai Skai's (currently supported by a single private investor) decision however, to ditch lithium batteries for a liquid hydrogen powertrain completely eliminates the battery technology bottleneck that almost every other company is hoping will resolve itself by the time they launch commercial services Certification - These are entirely new categories of aircraft, and the process of certifying, testing and regulating them is going to be monstrously expensive and time consuming. Federal support and urgency to outcompete global players should help the cause. Safety - To coordinate their thrust, each of the electric motor and fan units will need reliable sensors to accurately measure pressure, temperature and other indicators. Each of the motors will induce vibrations in the wings, and their fans may not all spin with the same efficiencies as wear and tear set in. It will be complicated to write software to reliably control all that, says Ella Atkins, an aerospace engineering professor at the University of Michigan. While Atkins says she doesn’t see anything that’s “absolutely a showstopper” with the design, she thinks the many years it took to solve the deadly control problems of the first tiltrotor aircraft, the U.S. military’s V-22 Osprey, offers a sobering parallel for Lilium and other EVTOL developers. “You need a lot of money and time to be successful in aerospace, and the truth is, this industry is trying to go too fast,” says Atkins. Next issue is use of ballistic parachutes. Ballistic parachutes can only save you above a certain altitude, maybe 120 feet or so. Below that, they don't have time to open up, which means that every time you take off or land in one of these machines, you're exposed to a window of time in which total system failure would drop you like a stone. Air Traffic Control - Down the track, there will also have to be a considerable leap forward in air traffic control if the skies are going to safely hold large numbers of these machines zipping about between a bunch of skyports/ vertiports dotted around an urban area. Public Perception - Public perception (trust and safety in tech) is a large obstacle. Safety is the greatest concern with “unruly” passengers, “lasing” of pilots, and aircraft sabotage being main contributors. New importance of travel time, increase in telecommuting, urbanization and de-congestion scenarios could reduce the viability of UAM markets. Advancement in driverless car tech will likely make UAMs suitable for long-distance commute only. All these problems are being worked on, and now we are ready to discuss 2 important SPAC plays that I have rounded up for investment in this space: Joby Aviation - $RTP (eVTOL Manufacturer | Long term play) Blade - $EXPC (eVTOL Asset Light Platform, aka 'Uber of skies'| Short-Mid term play) Outlook for EXPC and RTP Blade - EXPC Investor's presentation Blade is an eVTOL index play, often thought as the ""Uber of skies"" operates by connecting contract pilots with passengers to generate revenue via their proprietary platform. Blade’s business model is proven and is profitable; eVTOL is expected to improve unit economics and dramatically expand the addressable market of BLADE’s existing products. There are currently 167 different eVTOL aircraft under development. Blade is 1 of 1 asset light platform — poised to benefit regardless of which eVTOL manufacturer is first to market. Basically, Blade's strategy is akin to selling shovels in a gold rush. Rob Wiesenthal, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Blade, commented, “Ground mobility has been radically transformed by software and battery technology, as evidenced by the rapid adoption of electric vehicles. The next battle is in the air. This transaction provides the capital for Blade to profitably expand its urban air mobility business using conventional rotorcraft today, while providing a seamless transition to EVA aircraft tomorrow.” Blade and KSL have already identified around $300 million in short- to mid-term investment opportunities that will help Blade expand its presence in the northeastern United States, on the West Coast in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and in new markets that could include Vancouver, Jakarta, and Tokyo. (EXPC is sponsored by an affiliate of KSL Capital Partners, making the EXPC<>Blade strategic merger even more prudent). Blade operates in four key lines of business: Short Distance – Flights between 60 and 100 miles in distance, primarily servicing commuters for prices between $595 and $795 per seat (or $295 for monthly commuter pass holders). BLADE Airport – Flights between all New York area airports and dedicated Blade lounges in Manhattan’s heliports. Prices start at $195 per seat (or $95 per seat with the purchase of an annual Airport Pass)1 . BLADE MediMobility – Blade is the largest transporter of human organs in the Northeast United States, reducing the costs and transport time for hospitals versus legacy competitors. This business is a critical part of the Company’s growth strategy as organ movements are expected to be one of the first uses of EVA, before flights for passengers. International Joint Ventures – As part of its expansion strategy, the Company forms joint ventures with local partners in key overseas markets to provide the technology, customer experience, infrastructure design, and employee training, that enables a scalable and consistent Blade experience. Blade’s first international joint venture launched helicopter services late last year in India flying between Mumbai, Pune, and Shirdi. The Company expects to use proceeds from the transaction to fund expansion into new markets, including the Northeast Corridor and West Coast in the United States, as well as target addressable markets internationally (Vancouver, Jakarta and Tokyo). Blade's projected revenue outlook: Blade estimates its revenue in 2021 will reach $52 million. Moreover, by 2023, Blade estimates revenue will reach $181 million and $402 million by the end of 2024. This is all still before significant revenues occur from eVTOL which the company calls Phase 3 starting in 2025 and 2026. It does not assume any passenger eVTOL revenue before then. But in Phase 3, revenue is forecast to skyrocket to $601 million in 2025 and $875 million in 2026. (These numbers should be considered with a grain of salt) Blade's Competitive Moat: BLADE’s first mover advantage, extensive and loyal customer base and control of strategic infrastructure secures its leading position in the future of urban air mobility. #1 market share in key short-distance aviation markets, brings credibility to new market expansion. Strong management team with domain expertise and public market experience. BLADE is already slated to leverage and partner with KSL’s portfolio companies to generate attractive growth opportunities.

Another point to note is that Joby will be limited to their own aircrafts while Blade is already scanning potential players and will likely partner with different eVTOL operators depending on the nature of routes.

Form 8-K What Blade/ EXPC and Joby/ RTP Stocks are Worth Blade - EXPC PF shares outstanding: 82.5 million EXPC SP as of 03/14: $12.9 SPAC Cash = $375MM 82.5MM * $12.9/share = 1.064Bn PF Market Cap PF EV is = $689MM (PF Market Cap - SPAC Cash) Disruptive technology platforms have an average EV-sales ratio of 8.2x. In addition, luxury brands are at 7.5x and recent EV / SPAC mobility deals have averaged 6.5x. The average of all four of these groups of stocks is 7.4x. On page 37 of the presentation, Blade shows the EV-sales ratios of four groups of its peers. Unadjusted: 2024 estimated revenue is expected to be $402MM (Blade isn't accounting any eVTOL revenue, international expansion, operational upside or any strategic upside in this number). This means that the unadjusted EV-sales ratio for 2024 is 1.71x sales. That is very low. This means that at 7.4x $402 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $2.975 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is $3.35 billion. That is 215% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion. Unadjusted fair share price: 3.35Bn/82.5M = $40.61 Adjusted: We need to adjust the 2024 numbers to derive their present value. At a 15% discount rate for 4 years, the 2024 sales are worth 57.175% of this in today’s dollars. The present value sales number is $230 million (i.e., $402 million times 57.175%). As a result, the adjusted EV-sales multiple is 3x (i.e., $689 million EV divided by $230 million). This means that at 7.4x $230 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $1.702 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is $2.077 billion. That is 95.2% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion. Adjusted fair share price: 2.077Bn/82.5M = $25.2 Average between adjusted and unadjusted: Target market value is $2.713 billion. Fair share price: $32.89 Conclusion: EXPC stock is worth at least 154% more than its present price of $12.9 (As of 03/14/2021) This is without accounting all the hype from the merger announcement. Joby - RTP (Speculation) It's difficult to value this stock since all the revenue projections are subject to a lot of variables (Timely certification, customer acquisition, production delays, etc.) Yet, I am long term bullish on this stock.

,"Tl;dr: EXPC stock is worth at least 154% more than its present price of $12.9 (As of 03/14/2021). Both EXPC and RTP have significant catalysts lined up ahead that will likely boost the SP from current lows post-NASDAQ sell-off. What to expect Understanding the eVTOL Space Outlook for EXPC and RTP SPAC Transaction Summary What Blade/ EXPC and Joby/ RTP Stocks are Worth How I am playing EXPC and RTP Useful Links Understanding the eVTOL Space (Note: Skip to next section if you feel reading this background info is a drag) Before I even start discussing tickers and plays, I'd first like to shed some light on the groundbreaking Urban Air Mobility (UAM) space, where it's heading and who are the top players vying for the bigger piece of the pie. Understanding the potential investment opportunities without understanding this nascent space is a mooo point. Electric VTOL (Vertical Take off & Landing) air taxis are one of the great emerging technologies of our time, promising to unlock the skies as traffic-free, high-speed, 3D commuting routes. Much quieter and cheaper than helicopter travel, they'll also run on zero-local-emission electric power, and many models suggest they'll cost around the same per mile as a ground-based ride share. Currently there are over 100 players around the globe (check this article to get an overview of some the key players in the eVTOL space) in various stages of designing, building and commercializing eVTOL airframes. As is the case with any disruptive industry, the development and production of eVTOLs is an insanely cash hungry undertaking. Currently, we've a handful of frontrunners around the world who have gone public (Chinese eVTOL $EH) or are ripe to go public soon. Here's a the link to a well rounded DD comparing RTP-ACIC-EXPC-EH-Volo-Lilium that I highly recommend checking out. The United States is acutely aware that it 'missed the boat' on consumer drones, and it's an understandably sore point. But perhaps more importantly the geopolitical consequences of Chinese drone dominance appear to have reverberated around the corridors of the Pentagon for some time. One consequence of this situation is that the latest area of rapid aerospace innovation - eVTOL - has firmly captured the attention of US industry, investors and now the Department of Defense. Leaders of all stripes Stateside are determined that America will indeed be 'first' in this new and exciting area of aerospace innovation. The Air Force recently launched Agility Prime, a non-traditional program seeking to accelerate the commercial market for advanced air mobility vehicles (i.e., ""flying cars""). Check their website here and highly recommend reading this Wired article by USAF's former Acquisition Executive, Will Roper who starts his argument by drawing inspiration from the Jetsons. The outlook for UAM looks positive based on increasing congestion in cities. There are various estimates of the TAM (total addressable market) of UAM. In its presentation, Archer Aviation said that it expects a TAM of $1.5 trillion for UAM, which stretches to $3 trillion in the optimistic scenario. Joby Aviation said that it sees the TAM for UAM at $1 trillion globally and $500 billion in the U.S. Joby Aviation cited the 2018 UAM Market Study from Booz Allen Hamilton for its forecasts. Now, What's stopping us from having eVTOL air taxis today, then? Here are some of the factors you should be considering while evaluating potential investment opportunities: Batteries!! - Battery manufacturers' roadmaps are currently focused on satiating EV manufacturers and developing battery packs with required energy density and specific power (i.e. ability to sustain Tesla's ludicrous mode for a few minutes v/s a few seconds) could take a few years. Alakai Skai's (currently supported by a single private investor) decision however, to ditch lithium batteries for a liquid hydrogen powertrain completely eliminates the battery technology bottleneck that almost every other company is hoping will resolve itself by the time they launch commercial services Certification - These are entirely new categories of aircraft, and the process of certifying, testing and regulating them is going to be monstrously expensive and time consuming. Federal support and urgency to outcompete global players should help the cause. Safety - To coordinate their thrust, each of the electric motor and fan units will need reliable sensors to accurately measure pressure, temperature and other indicators. Each of the motors will induce vibrations in the wings, and their fans may not all spin with the same efficiencies as wear and tear set in. It will be complicated to write software to reliably control all that, says Ella Atkins, an aerospace engineering professor at the University of Michigan. While Atkins says she doesn’t see anything that’s “absolutely a showstopper” with the design, she thinks the many years it took to solve the deadly control problems of the first tiltrotor aircraft, the U.S. military’s V-22 Osprey, offers a sobering parallel for Lilium and other EVTOL developers. “You need a lot of money and time to be successful in aerospace, and the truth is, this industry is trying to go too fast,” says Atkins. Next issue is use of ballistic parachutes. Ballistic parachutes can only save you above a certain altitude, maybe 120 feet or so. Below that, they don't have time to open up, which means that every time you take off or land in one of these machines, you're exposed to a window of time in which total system failure would drop you like a stone. Air Traffic Control - Down the track, there will also have to be a considerable leap forward in air traffic control if the skies are going to safely hold large numbers of these machines zipping about between a bunch of skyports/ vertiports dotted around an urban area. Public Perception - Public perception (trust and safety in tech) is a large obstacle. Safety is the greatest concern with “unruly” passengers, “lasing” of pilots, and aircraft sabotage being main contributors. New importance of travel time, increase in telecommuting, urbanization and de-congestion scenarios could reduce the viability of UAM markets. Advancement in driverless car tech will likely make UAMs suitable for long-distance commute only. All these problems are being worked on, and now we are ready to discuss 2 important SPAC plays that I have rounded up for investment in this space: Joby Aviation - $RTP (eVTOL Manufacturer | Long term play) Blade - $EXPC (eVTOL Asset Light Platform, aka 'Uber of skies'| Short-Mid term play) Outlook for EXPC and RTP Blade - EXPC Investor's presentation Blade is an eVTOL index play, often thought as the ""Uber of skies"" operates by connecting contract pilots with passengers to generate revenue via their proprietary platform. Blade’s business model is proven and is profitable; eVTOL is expected to improve unit economics and dramatically expand the addressable market of BLADE’s existing products. There are currently 167 different eVTOL aircraft under development. Blade is 1 of 1 asset light platform — poised to benefit regardless of which eVTOL manufacturer is first to market. Basically, Blade's strategy is akin to selling shovels in a gold rush. Rob Wiesenthal, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Blade, commented, “Ground mobility has been radically transformed by software and battery technology, as evidenced by the rapid adoption of electric vehicles. The next battle is in the air. This transaction provides the capital for Blade to profitably expand its urban air mobility business using conventional rotorcraft today, while providing a seamless transition to EVA aircraft tomorrow.” Blade and KSL have already identified around $300 million in short- to mid-term investment opportunities that will help Blade expand its presence in the northeastern United States, on the West Coast in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and in new markets that could include Vancouver, Jakarta, and Tokyo. (EXPC is sponsored by an affiliate of KSL Capital Partners, making the EXPC<>Blade strategic merger even more prudent). Blade operates in four key lines of business: Short Distance – Flights between 60 and 100 miles in distance, primarily servicing commuters for prices between $595 and $795 per seat (or $295 for monthly commuter pass holders). BLADE Airport – Flights between all New York area airports and dedicated Blade lounges in Manhattan’s heliports. Prices start at $195 per seat (or $95 per seat with the purchase of an annual Airport Pass)1 . BLADE MediMobility – Blade is the largest transporter of human organs in the Northeast United States, reducing the costs and transport time for hospitals versus legacy competitors. This business is a critical part of the Company’s growth strategy as organ movements are expected to be one of the first uses of EVA, before flights for passengers. International Joint Ventures – As part of its expansion strategy, the Company forms joint ventures with local partners in key overseas markets to provide the technology, customer experience, infrastructure design, and employee training, that enables a scalable and consistent Blade experience. Blade’s first international joint venture launched helicopter services late last year in India flying between Mumbai, Pune, and Shirdi. The Company expects to use proceeds from the transaction to fund expansion into new markets, including the Northeast Corridor and West Coast in the United States, as well as target addressable markets internationally (Vancouver, Jakarta and Tokyo). Blade's projected revenue outlook: Blade estimates its revenue in 2021 will reach $52 million. Moreover, by 2023, Blade estimates revenue will reach $181 million and $402 million by the end of 2024. This is all still before significant revenues occur from eVTOL which the company calls Phase 3 starting in 2025 and 2026. It does not assume any passenger eVTOL revenue before then. But in Phase 3, revenue is forecast to skyrocket to $601 million in 2025 and $875 million in 2026. (These numbers should be considered with a grain of salt) Blade's Competitive Moat: BLADE’s first mover advantage, extensive and loyal customer base and control of strategic infrastructure secures its leading position in the future of urban air mobility. #1 market share in key short-distance aviation markets, brings credibility to new market expansion. Strong management team with domain expertise and public market experience. BLADE is already slated to leverage and partner with KSL’s portfolio companies to generate attractive growth opportunities. Proprietary technologies and asset-light model enables flight volume growth and accelerates launch timeline for new markets While Joby Aviation - Uber partnership pose a significant competitive threat, it's worth noting that Uber Elevate failed to take off even with its branding and it'll be challenging for Joby to front the customer acquisition cost (after bleeding dry with production upscaling and certification costs) and outcompete Blade who have an edge in that domain with their ever growing loyal customer base. Another point to note is that Joby will be limited to their own aircrafts while Blade is already scanning potential players and will likely partner with different eVTOL operators depending on the nature of routes. ARKQ is holding 2,748,457 shares, which represents 9.99% of public float for EXPC. Once the merger is complete, there will be a total of 82.5M shares. This means ARK currently own 2.9% of the 82.5M shares. Leadership: Upon completion of the transaction, the combined company will continue to be led by Mr. Wiesenthal as Chief Executive Officer. The senior management team will also include Will Heyburn, Chief Financial Officer and Head of Corporate Development, Brandon Keene, Chief Technology Officer, and Melissa Tomkiel, General Counsel.

In its presentation, Archer Aviation said that it expects a TAM of $1.5 trillion for UAM, which stretches to $3 trillion in the optimistic scenario. Joby Aviation said that it sees the TAM for UAM at $1 trillion globally and $500 billion in the U.S. Joby Aviation cited the 2018 UAM Market Study from Booz Allen Hamilton for its forecasts. Now, What's stopping us from having eVTOL air taxis today, then? Here are some of the factors you should be considering while evaluating potential investment opportunities: Batteries!! - Battery manufacturers' roadmaps are currently focused on satiating EV manufacturers and developing battery packs with required energy density and specific power (i.e. ability to sustain Tesla's ludicrous mode for a few minutes v/s a few seconds) could take a few years. Alakai Skai's (currently supported by a single private investor) decision however, to ditch lithium batteries for a liquid hydrogen powertrain completely eliminates the battery technology bottleneck that almost every other company is hoping will resolve itself by the time they launch commercial services Certification - These are entirely new categories of aircraft, and the process of certifying, testing and regulating them is going to be monstrously expensive and time consuming. Federal support and urgency to outcompete global players should help the cause. Safety - To coordinate their thrust, each of the electric motor and fan units will need reliable sensors to accurately measure pressure, temperature and other indicators. Each of the motors will induce vibrations in the wings, and their fans may not all spin with the same efficiencies as wear and tear set in. It will be complicated to write software to reliably control all that, says Ella Atkins, an aerospace engineering professor at the University of Michigan. While Atkins says she doesn’t see anything that’s “absolutely a showstopper” with the design, she thinks the many years it took to solve the deadly control problems of the first tiltrotor aircraft, the U.S. military’s V-22 Osprey, offers a sobering parallel for Lilium and other EVTOL developers. “You need a lot of money and time to be successful in aerospace, and the truth is, this industry is trying to go too fast,” says Atkins. Next issue is use of ballistic parachutes. Ballistic parachutes can only save you above a certain altitude, maybe 120 feet or so. Below that, they don't have time to open up, which means that every time you take off or land in one of these machines, you're exposed to a window of time in which total system failure would drop you like a stone. Air Traffic Control - Down the track, there will also have to be a considerable leap forward in air traffic control if the skies are going to safely hold large numbers of these machines zipping about between a bunch of skyports/ vertiports dotted around an urban area. Public Perception - Public perception (trust and safety in tech) is a large obstacle. Safety is the greatest concern with “unruly” passengers, “lasing” of pilots, and aircraft sabotage being main contributors. New importance of travel time, increase in telecommuting, urbanization and de-congestion scenarios could reduce the viability of UAM markets. Advancement in driverless car tech will likely make UAMs suitable for long-distance commute only. All these problems are being worked on, and now we are ready to discuss 2 important SPAC plays that I have rounded up for investment in this space: Joby Aviation - $RTP (eVTOL Manufacturer | Long term play) Blade - $EXPC (eVTOL Asset Light Platform, aka 'Uber of skies'| Short-Mid term play) Outlook for EXPC and RTP Blade - EXPC Investor's presentation Blade is an eVTOL index play, often thought as the ""Uber of skies"" operates by connecting contract pilots with passengers to generate revenue via their proprietary platform. Blade’s business model is proven and is profitable; eVTOL is expected to improve unit economics and dramatically expand the addressable market of BLADE’s existing products. There are currently 167 different eVTOL aircraft under development. Blade is 1 of 1 asset light platform — poised to benefit regardless of which eVTOL manufacturer is first to market. Basically, Blade's strategy is akin to selling shovels in a gold rush. Rob Wiesenthal, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Blade, commented, “Ground mobility has been radically transformed by software and battery technology, as evidenced by the rapid adoption of electric vehicles. The next battle is in the air. This transaction provides the capital for Blade to profitably expand its urban air mobility business using conventional rotorcraft today, while providing a seamless transition to EVA aircraft tomorrow.” Blade and KSL have already identified around $300 million in short- to mid-term investment opportunities that will help Blade expand its presence in the northeastern United States, on the West Coast in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and in new markets that could include Vancouver, Jakarta, and Tokyo. (EXPC is sponsored by an affiliate of KSL Capital Partners, making the EXPC<>Blade strategic merger even more prudent). Blade operates in four key lines of business: Short Distance – Flights between 60 and 100 miles in distance, primarily servicing commuters for prices between $595 and $795 per seat (or $295 for monthly commuter pass holders). BLADE Airport – Flights between all New York area airports and dedicated Blade lounges in Manhattan’s heliports. Prices start at $195 per seat (or $95 per seat with the purchase of an annual Airport Pass)1 . BLADE MediMobility – Blade is the largest transporter of human organs in the Northeast United States, reducing the costs and transport time for hospitals versus legacy competitors. This business is a critical part of the Company’s growth strategy as organ movements are expected to be one of the first uses of EVA, before flights for passengers. International Joint Ventures – As part of its expansion strategy, the Company forms joint ventures with local partners in key overseas markets to provide the technology, customer experience, infrastructure design, and employee training, that enables a scalable and consistent Blade experience. Blade’s first international joint venture launched helicopter services late last year in India flying between Mumbai, Pune, and Shirdi. The Company expects to use proceeds from the transaction to fund expansion into new markets, including the Northeast Corridor and West Coast in the United States, as well as target addressable markets internationally (Vancouver, Jakarta and Tokyo). Blade's projected revenue outlook: Blade estimates its revenue in 2021 will reach $52 million. Moreover, by 2023, Blade estimates revenue will reach $181 million and $402 million by the end of 2024. This is all still before significant revenues occur from eVTOL which the company calls Phase 3 starting in 2025 and 2026. It does not assume any passenger eVTOL revenue before then. But in Phase 3, revenue is forecast to skyrocket to $601 million in 2025 and $875 million in 2026. (These numbers should be considered with a grain of salt) Blade's Competitive Moat: BLADE’s first mover advantage, extensive and loyal customer base and control of strategic infrastructure secures its leading position in the future of urban air mobility. #1 market share in key short-distance aviation markets, brings credibility to new market expansion. Strong management team with domain expertise and public market experience. BLADE is already slated to leverage and partner with KSL’s portfolio companies to generate attractive growth opportunities. Proprietary technologies and asset-light model enables flight volume growth and accelerates launch timeline for new markets While Joby Aviation - Uber partnership pose a significant competitive threat, it's worth noting that Uber Elevate failed to take off even with its branding and it'll be challenging for Joby to front the customer acquisition cost (after bleeding dry with production upscaling and certification costs) and outcompete Blade who have an edge in that domain with their ever growing loyal customer base. Another point to note is that Joby will be limited to their own aircrafts while Blade is already scanning potential players and will likely partner with different eVTOL operators depending on the nature of routes. ARKQ is holding 2,748,457 shares, which represents 9.99% of public float for EXPC. Once the merger is complete, there will be a total of 82.5M shares. This means ARK currently own 2.9% of the 82.5M shares. Leadership: Upon completion of the transaction, the combined company will continue to be led by Mr. Wiesenthal as Chief Executive Officer. The senior management team will also include Will Heyburn, Chief Financial Officer and Head of Corporate Development, Brandon Keene, Chief Technology Officer, and Melissa Tomkiel, General Counsel.

Financial Advisors: Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, served as legal advisor to Reinvent. Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Allen & Company LLC served as placement agents on the PIPE transaction. Latham & Watkins LLP served as legal advisor and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Allen & Company LLC served as financial advisors to Joby. SPAC Transaction Summary Blade - EXPC (Investor's presentation) The transaction will be funded by a combination of EIC ($EXPC) cash held in a trust account and proceeds from a $125m PIPE, of which KSL has committed to subscribing for ~$20m PF shares outstanding: 82.5 million Transaction reflects pro forma market capitalization of $1.604 billion (The share price as I'm writing this is $12.9) Transaction will result in $375m of cash to balance sheet to fund growth Transaction implies a fully diluted pro forma equity value of $689.25m for Blade Existing Blade shareholders expected to receive 43.2% of the pro forma equity The boards of directors of both Blade and Experience Investment Corp. have unanimously approved the proposed transaction. The transaction is expected to close in 1H 2021; predictions expect voting to happen in the last week of March/first week of April. Form 8-K Joby - RTP (Investor's presentation) PF shares outstanding: 660 million The pro forma implied market capitalization of the combined company is $6.6 billion, at the $10.00 per share PIPE subscription price and assuming no public shareholders of Reinvent exercise their redemption rights. The Company will receive at the time of transaction close up to $690 million in proceeds from Reinvent’s cash in trust and an $835 million private placement of common stock at a $10.00 per share value and will also convert a $75 million convertible note into common stock at a $10.00 per share value. Pro-forma for the transaction, Joby expects to have up to $1.974Bn of cash to fund growth and commercialize its operations Transaction implies a fully diluted pro-forma aggregate value of $4.6Bn (2.3x AV / 2026E Revenue) Existing Joby shareholders to roll 100% of their equity and expected to receive 76% of the pro-forma equity Up to five-year lock-up on founder shares. Major stockholders and key executives of Joby have agreed to enter into separate lockup agreements as well. Price-based vesting triggers of $12, $18, $24, $32 and $50 per share on founder shares The boards of directors of both Reinvent and Joby have unanimously approved the transaction, which is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2021. Form 8-K What Blade/ EXPC and Joby/ RTP Stocks are Worth Blade - EXPC PF shares outstanding: 82.5 million EXPC SP as of 03/14: $12.9 SPAC Cash = $375MM 82.5MM * $12.9/share = 1.064Bn PF Market Cap PF EV is = $689MM (PF Market Cap - SPAC Cash) Disruptive technology platforms have an average EV-sales ratio of 8.2x. In addition, luxury brands are at 7.5x and recent EV / SPAC mobility deals have averaged 6.5x. The average of all four of these groups of stocks is 7.4x. On page 37 of the presentation, Blade shows the EV-sales ratios of four groups of its peers. Unadjusted: 2024 estimated revenue is expected to be $402MM (Blade isn't accounting any eVTOL revenue, international expansion, operational upside or any strategic upside in this number). This means that the unadjusted EV-sales ratio for 2024 is 1.71x sales. That is very low. This means that at 7.4x $402 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $2.975 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is $3.35 billion. That is 215% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion. Unadjusted fair share price: 3.35Bn/82.5M = $40.61 Adjusted: We need to adjust the 2024 numbers to derive their present value. At a 15% discount rate for 4 years, the 2024 sales are worth 57.175% of this in today’s dollars. The present value sales number is $230 million (i.e., $402 million times 57.175%). As a result, the adjusted EV-sales multiple is 3x (i.e., $689 million EV divided by $230 million). This means that at 7.4x $230 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $1.702 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is $2.077 billion. That is 95.2% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion. Adjusted fair share price: 2.077Bn/82.5M = $25.2 Average between adjusted and unadjusted: Target market value is $2.713 billion. Fair share price: $32.89 Conclusion: EXPC stock is worth at least 154% more than its present price of $12.9 (As of 03/14/2021) This is without accounting all the hype from the merger announcement. Joby - RTP (Speculation) It's difficult to value this stock since all the revenue projections are subject to a lot of variables (Timely certification, customer acquisition, production delays, etc.) Yet, I am long term bullish on this stock. With almost $2 billion in capital on-hand, the Elevate team, and Toyota as a manufacturing partner, Bevirt’s company has everything it needs to achieve his vision of saving a billion people an hour a day. Check Ehang (Chinese competitor) stock's trajectory over past 6 months. Clear that there's a lot of excitement surrounding eVTOLs and the news of merger should send this stock soaring in next few months. ARKX ETF is slated to launch end of this month and RTP is a great match for Cathie Wood's sub-orbital space category. How I am playing EXPC and RTP Catalysts: ARKX ETF launch EOM makes both EXPC and RTP a great spec play EXPC - A lot of spec predictions floating around about the shareholder vote on 3/31 Post NASDAQ sell-off was brutal for all SPACs and especially EXPC and RTP but these stocks are bound to rebound. Positions: 30 calls for 05/21 at $20 strike price, 18 calls for 8/20 at $25 strike price. I am tempted to pick up 04/16 $30 calls tomorrow. I don't have any RTP shares/calls but I might pick up a few calls tomorrow as well. Note that I am only playing catalysts at this point but may buy shares for RTP for long term investment (>5years). I find advent of eVTOLs super exciting. Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, heck this is my first time writing a DD so what do I even know about investing. Do your own DD and most importantly, let me know if I've got any part of the thesis glaringly wrong.

,"Tl;dr: EXPC stock is worth at least 154% more than its present price of $12.9 (As of 03/14/2021). Both EXPC and RTP have significant catalysts lined up ahead that will likely boost the SP from current lows post-NASDAQ sell-off. What to expect Understanding the eVTOL Space Outlook for EXPC and RTP SPAC Transaction Summary What Blade/ EXPC and Joby/ RTP Stocks are Worth How I am playing EXPC and RTP Useful Links Understanding the eVTOL Space (Note: Skip to next section if you feel reading this background info is a drag) Before I even start discussing tickers and plays, I'd first like to shed some light on the groundbreaking Urban Air Mobility (UAM) space, where it's heading and who are the top players vying for the bigger piece of the pie. Understanding the potential investment opportunities without understanding this nascent space is a mooo point. Electric VTOL (Vertical Take off & Landing) air taxis are one of the great emerging technologies of our time, promising to unlock the skies as traffic-free, high-speed, 3D commuting routes. Much quieter and cheaper than helicopter travel, they'll also run on zero-local-emission electric power, and many models suggest they'll cost around the same per mile as a ground-based ride share. Currently there are over 100 players around the globe (check this article to get an overview of some the key players in the eVTOL space) in various stages of designing, building and commercializing eVTOL airframes. As is the case with any disruptive industry, the development and production of eVTOLs is an insanely cash hungry undertaking. Currently, we've a handful of frontrunners around the world who have gone public (Chinese eVTOL $EH) or are ripe to go public soon. Here's a the link to a well rounded DD comparing RTP-ACIC-EXPC-EH-Volo-Lilium that I highly recommend checking out. The United States is acutely aware that it 'missed the boat' on consumer drones, and it's an understandably sore point. But perhaps more importantly the geopolitical consequences of Chinese drone dominance appear to have reverberated around the corridors of the Pentagon for some time. One consequence of this situation is that the latest area of rapid aerospace innovation - eVTOL - has firmly captured the attention of US industry, investors and now the Department of Defense. Leaders of all stripes Stateside are determined that America will indeed be 'first' in this new and exciting area of aerospace innovation. The Air Force recently launched Agility Prime, a non-traditional program seeking to accelerate the commercial market for advanced air mobility vehicles (i.e., ""flying cars""). Check their website here and highly recommend reading this Wired article by USAF's former Acquisition Executive, Will Roper who starts his argument by drawing inspiration from the Jetsons. The outlook for UAM looks positive based on increasing congestion in cities. There are various estimates of the TAM (total addressable market) of UAM.

SPAC Transaction Summary Blade - EXPC (Investor's presentation) The transaction will be funded by a combination of EIC ($EXPC) cash held in a trust account and proceeds from a $125m PIPE, of which KSL has committed to subscribing for ~$20m PF shares outstanding: 82.5 million Transaction reflects pro forma market capitalization of $1.604 billion (The share price as I'm writing this is $12.9) Transaction will result in $375m of cash to balance sheet to fund growth Transaction implies a fully diluted pro forma equity value of $689.25m for Blade Existing Blade shareholders expected to receive 43.2% of the pro forma equity The boards of directors of both Blade and Experience Investment Corp. have unanimously approved the proposed transaction. The transaction is expected to close in 1H 2021; predictions expect voting to happen in the last week of March/first week of April. Form 8-K Joby - RTP (Investor's presentation) PF shares outstanding: 660 million The pro forma implied market capitalization of the combined company is $6.6 billion, at the $10.00 per share PIPE subscription price and assuming no public shareholders of Reinvent exercise their redemption rights. The Company will receive at the time of transaction close up to $690 million in proceeds from Reinvent’s cash in trust and an $835 million private placement of common stock at a $10.00 per share value and will also convert a $75 million convertible note into common stock at a $10.00 per share value. Pro-forma for the transaction, Joby expects to have up to $1.974Bn of cash to fund growth and commercialize its operations Transaction implies a fully diluted pro-forma aggregate value of $4.6Bn (2.3x AV / 2026E Revenue) Existing Joby shareholders to roll 100% of their equity and expected to receive 76% of the pro-forma equity Up to five-year lock-up on founder shares. Major stockholders and key executives of Joby have agreed to enter into separate lockup agreements as well. Price-based vesting triggers of $12, $18, $24, $32 and $50 per share on founder shares The boards of directors of both Reinvent and Joby have unanimously approved the transaction, which is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2021. Form 8-K What Blade/ EXPC and Joby/ RTP Stocks are Worth Blade - EXPC PF shares outstanding: 82.5 million EXPC SP as of 03/14: $12.9 SPAC Cash = $375MM 82.5MM * $12.9/share = 1.064Bn PF Market Cap PF EV is = $689MM (PF Market Cap - SPAC Cash) Disruptive technology platforms have an average EV-sales ratio of 8.2x. In addition, luxury brands are at 7.5x and recent EV / SPAC mobility deals have averaged 6.5x. The average of all four of these groups of stocks is 7.4x. On page 37 of the presentation, Blade shows the EV-sales ratios of four groups of its peers. Unadjusted: 2024 estimated revenue is expected to be $402MM (Blade isn't accounting any eVTOL revenue, international expansion, operational upside or any strategic upside in this number). This means that the unadjusted EV-sales ratio for 2024 is 1.71x sales. That is very low. This means that at 7.4x $402 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $2.975 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is $3.35 billion. That is 215% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion. Unadjusted fair share price: 3.35Bn/82.5M = $40.61 Adjusted: We need to adjust the 2024 numbers to derive their present value. At a 15% discount rate for 4 years, the 2024 sales are worth 57.175% of this in today’s dollars. The present value sales number is $230 million (i.e., $402 million times 57.175%). As a result, the adjusted EV-sales multiple is 3x (i.e., $689 million EV divided by $230 million). This means that at 7.4x $230 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $1.702 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is $2.077 billion. That is 95.2% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion. Adjusted fair share price: 2.077Bn/82.5M = $25.2 Average between adjusted and unadjusted: Target market value is $2.713 billion. Fair share price: $32.89 Conclusion: EXPC stock is worth at least 154% more than its present price of $12.9 (As of 03/14/2021) This is without accounting all the hype from the merger announcement. Joby - RTP (Speculation) It's difficult to value this stock since all the revenue projections are subject to a lot of variables (Timely certification, customer acquisition, production delays, etc.) Yet, I am long term bullish on this stock. With almost $2 billion in capital on-hand, the Elevate team, and Toyota as a manufacturing partner, Bevirt’s company has everything it needs to achieve his vision of saving a billion people an hour a day. Check Ehang (Chinese competitor) stock's trajectory over past 6 months. Clear that there's a lot of excitement surrounding eVTOLs and the news of merger should send this stock soaring in next few months. ARKX ETF is slated to launch end of this month and RTP is a great match for Cathie Wood's sub-orbital space category. How I am playing EXPC and RTP Catalysts: ARKX ETF launch EOM makes both EXPC and RTP a great spec play EXPC - A lot of spec predictions floating around about the shareholder vote on 3/31 Post NASDAQ sell-off was brutal for all SPACs and especially EXPC and RTP but these stocks are bound to rebound. Positions: 30 calls for 05/21 at $20 strike price, 18 calls for 8/20 at $25 strike price. I am tempted to pick up 04/16 $30 calls tomorrow. I don't have any RTP shares/calls but I might pick up a few calls tomorrow as well. Note that I am only playing catalysts at this point but may buy shares for RTP for long term investment (>5years). I find advent of eVTOLs super exciting. Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, heck this is my first time writing a DD so what do I even know about investing.

,"Tl;dr: EXPC stock is worth at least 154% more than its present price of $12.9 (As of 03/14/2021). Both EXPC and RTP have significant catalysts lined up ahead that will likely boost the SP from current lows post-NASDAQ sell-off. What to expect Understanding the eVTOL Space Outlook for EXPC and RTP SPAC Transaction Summary What Blade/ EXPC and Joby/ RTP Stocks are Worth How I am playing EXPC and RTP Useful Links Understanding the eVTOL Space (Note: Skip to next section if you feel reading this background info is a drag) Before I even start discussing tickers and plays, I'd first like to shed some light on the groundbreaking Urban Air Mobility (UAM) space, where it's heading and who are the top players vying for the bigger piece of the pie. Understanding the potential investment opportunities without understanding this nascent space is a mooo point. Electric VTOL (Vertical Take off & Landing) air taxis are one of the great emerging technologies of our time, promising to unlock the skies as traffic-free, high-speed, 3D commuting routes. Much quieter and cheaper than helicopter travel, they'll also run on zero-local-emission electric power, and many models suggest they'll cost around the same per mile as a ground-based ride share. Currently there are over 100 players around the globe (check this article to get an overview of some the key players in the eVTOL space) in various stages of designing, building and commercializing eVTOL airframes. As is the case with any disruptive industry, the development and production of eVTOLs is an insanely cash hungry undertaking. Currently, we've a handful of frontrunners around the world who have gone public (Chinese eVTOL $EH) or are ripe to go public soon. Here's a the link to a well rounded DD comparing RTP-ACIC-EXPC-EH-Volo-Lilium that I highly recommend checking out. The United States is acutely aware that it 'missed the boat' on consumer drones, and it's an understandably sore point. But perhaps more importantly the geopolitical consequences of Chinese drone dominance appear to have reverberated around the corridors of the Pentagon for some time. One consequence of this situation is that the latest area of rapid aerospace innovation - eVTOL - has firmly captured the attention of US industry, investors and now the Department of Defense. Leaders of all stripes Stateside are determined that America will indeed be 'first' in this new and exciting area of aerospace innovation. The Air Force recently launched Agility Prime, a non-traditional program seeking to accelerate the commercial market for advanced air mobility vehicles (i.e., ""flying cars""). Check their website here and highly recommend reading this Wired article by USAF's former Acquisition Executive, Will Roper who starts his argument by drawing inspiration from the Jetsons. The outlook for UAM looks positive based on increasing congestion in cities. There are various estimates of the TAM (total addressable market) of UAM. In its presentation, Archer Aviation said that it expects a TAM of $1.5 trillion for UAM, which stretches to $3 trillion in the optimistic scenario. Joby Aviation said that it sees the TAM for UAM at $1 trillion globally and $500 billion in the U.S. Joby Aviation cited the 2018 UAM Market Study from Booz Allen Hamilton for its forecasts. Now, What's stopping us from having eVTOL air taxis today, then? Here are some of the factors you should be considering while evaluating potential investment opportunities: Batteries!! - Battery manufacturers' roadmaps are currently focused on satiating EV manufacturers and developing battery packs with required energy density and specific power (i.e. ability to sustain Tesla's ludicrous mode for a few minutes v/s a few seconds) could take a few years. Alakai Skai's (currently supported by a single private investor) decision however, to ditch lithium batteries for a liquid hydrogen powertrain completely eliminates the battery technology bottleneck that almost every other company is hoping will resolve itself by the time they launch commercial services Certification - These are entirely new categories of aircraft, and the process of certifying, testing and regulating them is going to be monstrously expensive and time consuming. Federal support and urgency to outcompete global players should help the cause. Safety - To coordinate their thrust, each of the electric motor and fan units will need reliable sensors to accurately measure pressure, temperature and other indicators. Each of the motors will induce vibrations in the wings, and their fans may not all spin with the same efficiencies as wear and tear set in. It will be complicated to write software to reliably control all that, says Ella Atkins, an aerospace engineering professor at the University of Michigan. While Atkins says she doesn’t see anything that’s “absolutely a showstopper” with the design, she thinks the many years it took to solve the deadly control problems of the first tiltrotor aircraft, the U.S. military’s V-22 Osprey, offers a sobering parallel for Lilium and other EVTOL developers. “You need a lot of money and time to be successful in aerospace, and the truth is, this industry is trying to go too fast,” says Atkins. Next issue is use of ballistic parachutes. Ballistic parachutes can only save you above a certain altitude, maybe 120 feet or so. Below that, they don't have time to open up, which means that every time you take off or land in one of these machines, you're exposed to a window of time in which total system failure would drop you like a stone. Air Traffic Control - Down the track, there will also have to be a considerable leap forward in air traffic control if the skies are going to safely hold large numbers of these machines zipping about between a bunch of skyports/ vertiports dotted around an urban area. Public Perception - Public perception (trust and safety in tech) is a large obstacle. Safety is the greatest concern with “unruly” passengers, “lasing” of pilots, and aircraft sabotage being main contributors. New importance of travel time, increase in telecommuting, urbanization and de-congestion scenarios could reduce the viability of UAM markets. Advancement in driverless car tech will likely make UAMs suitable for long-distance commute only. All these problems are being worked on, and now we are ready to discuss 2 important SPAC plays that I have rounded up for investment in this space: Joby Aviation - $RTP (eVTOL Manufacturer | Long term play) Blade - $EXPC (eVTOL Asset Light Platform, aka 'Uber of skies'| Short-Mid term play) Outlook for EXPC and RTP Blade - EXPC Investor's presentation Blade is an eVTOL index play, often thought as the ""Uber of skies"" operates by connecting contract pilots with passengers to generate revenue via their proprietary platform. Blade’s business model is proven and is profitable; eVTOL is expected to improve unit economics and dramatically expand the addressable market of BLADE’s existing products. There are currently 167 different eVTOL aircraft under development. Blade is 1 of 1 asset light platform — poised to benefit regardless of which eVTOL manufacturer is first to market. Basically, Blade's strategy is akin to selling shovels in a gold rush. Rob Wiesenthal, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Blade, commented, “Ground mobility has been radically transformed by software and battery technology, as evidenced by the rapid adoption of electric vehicles. The next battle is in the air. This transaction provides the capital for Blade to profitably expand its urban air mobility business using conventional rotorcraft today, while providing a seamless transition to EVA aircraft tomorrow.” Blade and KSL have already identified around $300 million in short- to mid-term investment opportunities that will help Blade expand its presence in the northeastern United States, on the West Coast in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and in new markets that could include Vancouver, Jakarta, and Tokyo. (EXPC is sponsored by an affiliate of KSL Capital Partners, making the EXPC<>Blade strategic merger even more prudent). Blade operates in four key lines of business: Short Distance – Flights between 60 and 100 miles in distance, primarily servicing commuters for prices between $595 and $795 per seat (or $295 for monthly commuter pass holders). BLADE Airport – Flights between all New York area airports and dedicated Blade lounges in Manhattan’s heliports. Prices start at $195 per seat (or $95 per seat with the purchase of an annual Airport Pass)1 . BLADE MediMobility – Blade is the largest transporter of human organs in the Northeast United States, reducing the costs and transport time for hospitals versus legacy competitors. This business is a critical part of the Company’s growth strategy as organ movements are expected to be one of the first uses of EVA, before flights for passengers. International Joint Ventures – As part of its expansion strategy, the Company forms joint ventures with local partners in key overseas markets to provide the technology, customer experience, infrastructure design, and employee training, that enables a scalable and consistent Blade experience. Blade’s first international joint venture launched helicopter services late last year in India flying between Mumbai, Pune, and Shirdi. The Company expects to use proceeds from the transaction to fund expansion into new markets, including the Northeast Corridor and West Coast in the United States, as well as target addressable markets internationally (Vancouver, Jakarta and Tokyo). Blade's projected revenue outlook: Blade estimates its revenue in 2021 will reach $52 million. Moreover, by 2023, Blade estimates revenue will reach $181 million and $402 million by the end of 2024. This is all still before significant revenues occur from eVTOL which the company calls Phase 3 starting in 2025 and 2026. It does not assume any passenger eVTOL revenue before then. But in Phase 3, revenue is forecast to skyrocket to $601 million in 2025 and $875 million in 2026. (These numbers should be considered with a grain of salt) Blade's Competitive Moat: BLADE’s first mover advantage, extensive and loyal customer base and control of strategic infrastructure secures its leading position in the future of urban air mobility. #1 market share in key short-distance aviation markets, brings credibility to new market expansion. Strong management team with domain expertise and public market experience. BLADE is already slated to leverage and partner with KSL’s portfolio companies to generate attractive growth opportunities. Proprietary technologies and asset-light model enables flight volume growth and accelerates launch timeline for new markets While Joby Aviation - Uber partnership pose a significant competitive threat, it's worth noting that Uber Elevate failed to take off even with its branding and it'll be challenging for Joby to front the customer acquisition cost (after bleeding dry with production upscaling and certification costs) and outcompete Blade who have an edge in that domain with their ever growing loyal customer base. Another point to note is that Joby will be limited to their own aircrafts while Blade is already scanning potential players and will likely partner with different eVTOL operators depending on the nature of routes. ARKQ is holding 2,748,457 shares, which represents 9.99% of public float for EXPC. Once the merger is complete, there will be a total of 82.5M shares. This means ARK currently own 2.9% of the 82.5M shares. Leadership: Upon completion of the transaction, the combined company will continue to be led by Mr. Wiesenthal as Chief Executive Officer. The senior management team will also include Will Heyburn, Chief Financial Officer and Head of Corporate Development, Brandon Keene, Chief Technology Officer, and Melissa Tomkiel, General Counsel.

Both EXPC and RTP have significant catalysts lined up ahead that will likely boost the SP from current lows post-NASDAQ sell-off. What to expect Understanding the eVTOL Space Outlook for EXPC and RTP SPAC Transaction Summary What Blade/ EXPC and Joby/ RTP Stocks are Worth How I am playing EXPC and RTP Useful Links Understanding the eVTOL Space (Note: Skip to next section if you feel reading this background info is a drag) Before I even start discussing tickers and plays, I'd first like to shed some light on the groundbreaking Urban Air Mobility (UAM) space, where it's heading and who are the top players vying for the bigger piece of the pie. Understanding the potential investment opportunities without understanding this nascent space is a mooo point. Electric VTOL (Vertical Take off & Landing) air taxis are one of the great emerging technologies of our time, promising to unlock the skies as traffic-free, high-speed, 3D commuting routes. Much quieter and cheaper than helicopter travel, they'll also run on zero-local-emission electric power, and many models suggest they'll cost around the same per mile as a ground-based ride share. Currently there are over 100 players around the globe (check this article to get an overview of some the key players in the eVTOL space) in various stages of designing, building and commercializing eVTOL airframes. As is the case with any disruptive industry, the development and production of eVTOLs is an insanely cash hungry undertaking. Currently, we've a handful of frontrunners around the world who have gone public (Chinese eVTOL $EH) or are ripe to go public soon. Here's a the link to a well rounded DD comparing RTP-ACIC-EXPC-EH-Volo-Lilium that I highly recommend checking out. The United States is acutely aware that it 'missed the boat' on consumer drones, and it's an understandably sore point. But perhaps more importantly the geopolitical consequences of Chinese drone dominance appear to have reverberated around the corridors of the Pentagon for some time. One consequence of this situation is that the latest area of rapid aerospace innovation - eVTOL - has firmly captured the attention of US industry, investors and now the Department of Defense. Leaders of all stripes Stateside are determined that America will indeed be 'first' in this new and exciting area of aerospace innovation. The Air Force recently launched Agility Prime, a non-traditional program seeking to accelerate the commercial market for advanced air mobility vehicles (i.e., ""flying cars""). Check their website here and highly recommend reading this Wired article by USAF's former Acquisition Executive, Will Roper who starts his argument by drawing inspiration from the Jetsons. The outlook for UAM looks positive based on increasing congestion in cities. There are various estimates of the TAM (total addressable market) of UAM. In its presentation, Archer Aviation said that it expects a TAM of $1.5 trillion for UAM, which stretches to $3 trillion in the optimistic scenario. Joby Aviation said that it sees the TAM for UAM at $1 trillion globally and $500 billion in the U.S. Joby Aviation cited the 2018 UAM Market Study from Booz Allen Hamilton for its forecasts. Now, What's stopping us from having eVTOL air taxis today, then? Here are some of the factors you should be considering while evaluating potential investment opportunities: Batteries!! - Battery manufacturers' roadmaps are currently focused on satiating EV manufacturers and developing battery packs with required energy density and specific power (i.e. ability to sustain Tesla's ludicrous mode for a few minutes v/s a few seconds) could take a few years. Alakai Skai's (currently supported by a single private investor) decision however, to ditch lithium batteries for a liquid hydrogen powertrain completely eliminates the battery technology bottleneck that almost every other company is hoping will resolve itself by the time they launch commercial services Certification - These are entirely new categories of aircraft, and the process of certifying, testing and regulating them is going to be monstrously expensive and time consuming. Federal support and urgency to outcompete global players should help the cause. Safety - To coordinate their thrust, each of the electric motor and fan units will need reliable sensors to accurately measure pressure, temperature and other indicators. Each of the motors will induce vibrations in the wings, and their fans may not all spin with the same efficiencies as wear and tear set in. It will be complicated to write software to reliably control all that, says Ella Atkins, an aerospace engineering professor at the University of Michigan. While Atkins says she doesn’t see anything that’s “absolutely a showstopper” with the design, she thinks the many years it took to solve the deadly control problems of the first tiltrotor aircraft, the U.S. military’s V-22 Osprey, offers a sobering parallel for Lilium and other EVTOL developers. “You need a lot of money and time to be successful in aerospace, and the truth is, this industry is trying to go too fast,” says Atkins. Next issue is use of ballistic parachutes. Ballistic parachutes can only save you above a certain altitude, maybe 120 feet or so. Below that, they don't have time to open up, which means that every time you take off or land in one of these machines, you're exposed to a window of time in which total system failure would drop you like a stone. Air Traffic Control - Down the track, there will also have to be a considerable leap forward in air traffic control if the skies are going to safely hold large numbers of these machines zipping about between a bunch of skyports/ vertiports dotted around an urban area. Public Perception - Public perception (trust and safety in tech) is a large obstacle. Safety is the greatest concern with “unruly” passengers, “lasing” of pilots, and aircraft sabotage being main contributors. New importance of travel time, increase in telecommuting, urbanization and de-congestion scenarios could reduce the viability of UAM markets. Advancement in driverless car tech will likely make UAMs suitable for long-distance commute only. All these problems are being worked on, and now we are ready to discuss 2 important SPAC plays that I have rounded up for investment in this space: Joby Aviation - $RTP (eVTOL Manufacturer | Long term play) Blade - $EXPC (eVTOL Asset Light Platform, aka 'Uber of skies'| Short-Mid term play) Outlook for EXPC and RTP Blade - EXPC Investor's presentation Blade is an eVTOL index play, often thought as the ""Uber of skies"" operates by connecting contract pilots with passengers to generate revenue via their proprietary platform. Blade’s business model is proven and is profitable; eVTOL is expected to improve unit economics and dramatically expand the addressable market of BLADE’s existing products. There are currently 167 different eVTOL aircraft under development. Blade is 1 of 1 asset light platform — poised to benefit regardless of which eVTOL manufacturer is first to market. Basically, Blade's strategy is akin to selling shovels in a gold rush. Rob Wiesenthal, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Blade, commented, “Ground mobility has been radically transformed by software and battery technology, as evidenced by the rapid adoption of electric vehicles. The next battle is in the air. This transaction provides the capital for Blade to profitably expand its urban air mobility business using conventional rotorcraft today, while providing a seamless transition to EVA aircraft tomorrow.” Blade and KSL have already identified around $300 million in short- to mid-term investment opportunities that will help Blade expand its presence in the northeastern United States, on the West Coast in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and in new markets that could include Vancouver, Jakarta, and Tokyo. (EXPC is sponsored by an affiliate of KSL Capital Partners, making the EXPC<>Blade strategic merger even more prudent). Blade operates in four key lines of business: Short Distance – Flights between 60 and 100 miles in distance, primarily servicing commuters for prices between $595 and $795 per seat (or $295 for monthly commuter pass holders). BLADE Airport – Flights between all New York area airports and dedicated Blade lounges in Manhattan’s heliports. Prices start at $195 per seat (or $95 per seat with the purchase of an annual Airport Pass)1 . BLADE MediMobility – Blade is the largest transporter of human organs in the Northeast United States, reducing the costs and transport time for hospitals versus legacy competitors. This business is a critical part of the Company’s growth strategy as organ movements are expected to be one of the first uses of EVA, before flights for passengers. International Joint Ventures – As part of its expansion strategy, the Company forms joint ventures with local partners in key overseas markets to provide the technology, customer experience, infrastructure design, and employee training, that enables a scalable and consistent Blade experience. Blade’s first international joint venture launched helicopter services late last year in India flying between Mumbai, Pune, and Shirdi. The Company expects to use proceeds from the transaction to fund expansion into new markets, including the Northeast Corridor and West Coast in the United States, as well as target addressable markets internationally (Vancouver, Jakarta and Tokyo). Blade's projected revenue outlook: Blade estimates its revenue in 2021 will reach $52 million. Moreover, by 2023, Blade estimates revenue will reach $181 million and $402 million by the end of 2024. This is all still before significant revenues occur from eVTOL which the company calls Phase 3 starting in 2025 and 2026. It does not assume any passenger eVTOL revenue before then. But in Phase 3, revenue is forecast to skyrocket to $601 million in 2025 and $875 million in 2026. (These numbers should be considered with a grain of salt) Blade's Competitive Moat: BLADE’s first mover advantage, extensive and loyal customer base and control of strategic infrastructure secures its leading position in the future of urban air mobility. #1 market share in key short-distance aviation markets, brings credibility to new market expansion. Strong management team with domain expertise and public market experience. BLADE is already slated to leverage and partner with KSL’s portfolio companies to generate attractive growth opportunities. Proprietary technologies and asset-light model enables flight volume growth and accelerates launch timeline for new markets While Joby Aviation - Uber partnership pose a significant competitive threat, it's worth noting that Uber Elevate failed to take off even with its branding and it'll be challenging for Joby to front the customer acquisition cost (after bleeding dry with production upscaling and certification costs) and outcompete Blade who have an edge in that domain with their ever growing loyal customer base. Another point to note is that Joby will be limited to their own aircrafts while Blade is already scanning potential players and will likely partner with different eVTOL operators depending on the nature of routes. ARKQ is holding 2,748,457 shares, which represents 9.99% of public float for EXPC. Once the merger is complete, there will be a total of 82.5M shares. This means ARK currently own 2.9% of the 82.5M shares. Leadership: Upon completion of the transaction, the combined company will continue to be led by Mr. Wiesenthal as Chief Executive Officer. The senior management team will also include Will Heyburn, Chief Financial Officer and Head of Corporate Development, Brandon Keene, Chief Technology Officer, and Melissa Tomkiel, General Counsel. Board of Directors upon completion of transaction: Eric Affeldt, Chief Executive Officer of Experience Investment Corp. and previously CEO of publicly-traded ClubCorp Jane Garvey, former administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and former Chairman of the Board of Directors of United Airlines Holdings, Inc.

SPAC Transaction Summary Blade - EXPC (Investor's presentation) The transaction will be funded by a combination of EIC ($EXPC) cash held in a trust account and proceeds from a $125m PIPE, of which KSL has committed to subscribing for ~$20m PF shares outstanding: 82.5 million Transaction reflects pro forma market capitalization of $1.604 billion (The share price as I'm writing this is $12.9) Transaction will result in $375m of cash to balance sheet to fund growth Transaction implies a fully diluted pro forma equity value of $689.25m for Blade Existing Blade shareholders expected to receive 43.2% of the pro forma equity The boards of directors of both Blade and Experience Investment Corp. have unanimously approved the proposed transaction. The transaction is expected to close in 1H 2021; predictions expect voting to happen in the last week of March/first week of April. Form 8-K Joby - RTP (Investor's presentation) PF shares outstanding: 660 million The pro forma implied market capitalization of the combined company is $6.6 billion, at the $10.00 per share PIPE subscription price and assuming no public shareholders of Reinvent exercise their redemption rights. The Company will receive at the time of transaction close up to $690 million in proceeds from Reinvent’s cash in trust and an $835 million private placement of common stock at a $10.00 per share value and will also convert a $75 million convertible note into common stock at a $10.00 per share value. Pro-forma for the transaction, Joby expects to have up to $1.974Bn of cash to fund growth and commercialize its operations Transaction implies a fully diluted pro-forma aggregate value of $4.6Bn (2.3x AV / 2026E Revenue) Existing Joby shareholders to roll 100% of their equity and expected to receive 76% of the pro-forma equity Up to five-year lock-up on founder shares. Major stockholders and key executives of Joby have agreed to enter into separate lockup agreements as well. Price-based vesting triggers of $12, $18, $24, $32 and $50 per share on founder shares The boards of directors of both Reinvent and Joby have unanimously approved the transaction, which is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2021. Form 8-K What Blade/ EXPC and Joby/ RTP Stocks are Worth Blade - EXPC PF shares outstanding: 82.5 million EXPC SP as of 03/14: $12.9 SPAC Cash = $375MM 82.5MM * $12.9/share = 1.064Bn PF Market Cap PF EV is = $689MM (PF Market Cap - SPAC Cash) Disruptive technology platforms have an average EV-sales ratio of 8.2x. In addition, luxury brands are at 7.5x and recent EV / SPAC mobility deals have averaged 6.5x. The average of all four of these groups of stocks is 7.4x. On page 37 of the presentation, Blade shows the EV-sales ratios of four groups of its peers. Unadjusted: 2024 estimated revenue is expected to be $402MM (Blade isn't accounting any eVTOL revenue, international expansion, operational upside or any strategic upside in this number). This means that the unadjusted EV-sales ratio for 2024 is 1.71x sales. That is very low. This means that at 7.4x $402 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $2.975 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is $3.35 billion. That is 215% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion. Unadjusted fair share price: 3.35Bn/82.5M = $40.61 Adjusted: We need to adjust the 2024 numbers to derive their present value. At a 15% discount rate for 4 years, the 2024 sales are worth 57.175% of this in today’s dollars. The present value sales number is $230 million (i.e., $402 million times 57.175%). As a result, the adjusted EV-sales multiple is 3x (i.e., $689 million EV divided by $230 million). This means that at 7.4x $230 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $1.702 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is $2.077 billion. That is 95.2% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion. Adjusted fair share price: 2.077Bn/82.5M = $25.2 Average between adjusted and unadjusted: Target market value is $2.713 billion. Fair share price: $32.89 Conclusion: EXPC stock is worth at least 154% more than its present price of $12.9 (As of 03/14/2021) This is without accounting all the hype from the merger announcement. Joby - RTP (Speculation) It's difficult to value this stock since all the revenue projections are subject to a lot of variables (Timely certification, customer acquisition, production delays, etc.) Yet, I am long term bullish on this stock. With almost $2 billion in capital on-hand, the Elevate team, and Toyota as a manufacturing partner, Bevirt’s company has everything it needs to achieve his vision of saving a billion people an hour a day. Check Ehang (Chinese competitor) stock's trajectory over past 6 months. Clear that there's a lot of excitement surrounding eVTOLs and the news of merger should send this stock soaring in next few months. ARKX ETF is slated to launch end of this month and RTP is a great match for Cathie Wood's sub-orbital space category. How I am playing EXPC and RTP Catalysts: ARKX ETF launch EOM makes both EXPC and RTP a great spec play EXPC - A lot of spec predictions floating around about the shareholder vote on 3/31 Post NASDAQ sell-off was brutal for all SPACs and especially EXPC and RTP but these stocks are bound to rebound.

All these problems are being worked on, and now we are ready to discuss 2 important SPAC plays that I have rounded up for investment in this space: Joby Aviation - $RTP (eVTOL Manufacturer | Long term play) Blade - $EXPC (eVTOL Asset Light Platform, aka 'Uber of skies'| Short-Mid term play) Outlook for EXPC and RTP Blade - EXPC Investor's presentation Blade is an eVTOL index play, often thought as the ""Uber of skies"" operates by connecting contract pilots with passengers to generate revenue via their proprietary platform. Blade’s business model is proven and is profitable; eVTOL is expected to improve unit economics and dramatically expand the addressable market of BLADE’s existing products. There are currently 167 different eVTOL aircraft under development. Blade is 1 of 1 asset light platform — poised to benefit regardless of which eVTOL manufacturer is first to market. Basically, Blade's strategy is akin to selling shovels in a gold rush. Rob Wiesenthal, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Blade, commented, “Ground mobility has been radically transformed by software and battery technology, as evidenced by the rapid adoption of electric vehicles. The next battle is in the air. This transaction provides the capital for Blade to profitably expand its urban air mobility business using conventional rotorcraft today, while providing a seamless transition to EVA aircraft tomorrow.” Blade and KSL have already identified around $300 million in short- to mid-term investment opportunities that will help Blade expand its presence in the northeastern United States, on the West Coast in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and in new markets that could include Vancouver, Jakarta, and Tokyo. (EXPC is sponsored by an affiliate of KSL Capital Partners, making the EXPC<>Blade strategic merger even more prudent). Blade operates in four key lines of business: Short Distance – Flights between 60 and 100 miles in distance, primarily servicing commuters for prices between $595 and $795 per seat (or $295 for monthly commuter pass holders). BLADE Airport – Flights between all New York area airports and dedicated Blade lounges in Manhattan’s heliports. Prices start at $195 per seat (or $95 per seat with the purchase of an annual Airport Pass)1 . BLADE MediMobility – Blade is the largest transporter of human organs in the Northeast United States, reducing the costs and transport time for hospitals versus legacy competitors. This business is a critical part of the Company’s growth strategy as organ movements are expected to be one of the first uses of EVA, before flights for passengers. International Joint Ventures – As part of its expansion strategy, the Company forms joint ventures with local partners in key overseas markets to provide the technology, customer experience, infrastructure design, and employee training, that enables a scalable and consistent Blade experience. Blade’s first international joint venture launched helicopter services late last year in India flying between Mumbai, Pune, and Shirdi. The Company expects to use proceeds from the transaction to fund expansion into new markets, including the Northeast Corridor and West Coast in the United States, as well as target addressable markets internationally (Vancouver, Jakarta and Tokyo). Blade's projected revenue outlook: Blade estimates its revenue in 2021 will reach $52 million. Moreover, by 2023, Blade estimates revenue will reach $181 million and $402 million by the end of 2024. This is all still before significant revenues occur from eVTOL which the company calls Phase 3 starting in 2025 and 2026. It does not assume any passenger eVTOL revenue before then. But in Phase 3, revenue is forecast to skyrocket to $601 million in 2025 and $875 million in 2026. (These numbers should be considered with a grain of salt) Blade's Competitive Moat: BLADE’s first mover advantage, extensive and loyal customer base and control of strategic infrastructure secures its leading position in the future of urban air mobility. #1 market share in key short-distance aviation markets, brings credibility to new market expansion. Strong management team with domain expertise and public market experience. BLADE is already slated to leverage and partner with KSL’s portfolio companies to generate attractive growth opportunities. Proprietary technologies and asset-light model enables flight volume growth and accelerates launch timeline for new markets While Joby Aviation - Uber partnership pose a significant competitive threat, it's worth noting that Uber Elevate failed to take off even with its branding and it'll be challenging for Joby to front the customer acquisition cost (after bleeding dry with production upscaling and certification costs) and outcompete Blade who have an edge in that domain with their ever growing loyal customer base. Another point to note is that Joby will be limited to their own aircrafts while Blade is already scanning potential players and will likely partner with different eVTOL operators depending on the nature of routes. ARKQ is holding 2,748,457 shares, which represents 9.99% of public float for EXPC. Once the merger is complete, there will be a total of 82.5M shares. This means ARK currently own 2.9% of the 82.5M shares. Leadership: Upon completion of the transaction, the combined company will continue to be led by Mr. Wiesenthal as Chief Executive Officer.

SPAC Transaction Summary Blade - EXPC (Investor's presentation) The transaction will be funded by a combination of EIC ($EXPC) cash held in a trust account and proceeds from a $125m PIPE, of which KSL has committed to subscribing for ~$20m PF shares outstanding: 82.5 million Transaction reflects pro forma market capitalization of $1.604 billion (The share price as I'm writing this is $12.9) Transaction will result in $375m of cash to balance sheet to fund growth Transaction implies a fully diluted pro forma equity value of $689.25m for Blade Existing Blade shareholders expected to receive 43.2% of the pro forma equity The boards of directors of both Blade and Experience Investment Corp. have unanimously approved the proposed transaction. The transaction is expected to close in 1H 2021; predictions expect voting to happen in the last week of March/first week of April. Form 8-K Joby - RTP (Investor's presentation) PF shares outstanding: 660 million The pro forma implied market capitalization of the combined company is $6.6 billion, at the $10.00 per share PIPE subscription price and assuming no public shareholders of Reinvent exercise their redemption rights. The Company will receive at the time of transaction close up to $690 million in proceeds from Reinvent’s cash in trust and an $835 million private placement of common stock at a $10.00 per share value and will also convert a $75 million convertible note into common stock at a $10.00 per share value. Pro-forma for the transaction, Joby expects to have up to $1.974Bn of cash to fund growth and commercialize its operations Transaction implies a fully diluted pro-forma aggregate value of $4.6Bn (2.3x AV / 2026E Revenue) Existing Joby shareholders to roll 100% of their equity and expected to receive 76% of the pro-forma equity Up to five-year lock-up on founder shares. Major stockholders and key executives of Joby have agreed to enter into separate lockup agreements as well. Price-based vesting triggers of $12, $18, $24, $32 and $50 per share on founder shares The boards of directors of both Reinvent and Joby have unanimously approved the transaction, which is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2021. Form 8-K What Blade/ EXPC and Joby/ RTP Stocks are Worth Blade - EXPC PF shares outstanding: 82.5 million EXPC SP as of 03/14: $12.9 SPAC Cash = $375MM 82.5MM * $12.9/share = 1.064Bn PF Market Cap PF EV is = $689MM (PF Market Cap - SPAC Cash) Disruptive technology platforms have an average EV-sales ratio of 8.2x. In addition, luxury brands are at 7.5x and recent EV / SPAC mobility deals have averaged 6.5x. The average of all four of these groups of stocks is 7.4x. On page 37 of the presentation, Blade shows the EV-sales ratios of four groups of its peers. Unadjusted: 2024 estimated revenue is expected to be $402MM (Blade isn't accounting any eVTOL revenue, international expansion, operational upside or any strategic upside in this number). This means that the unadjusted EV-sales ratio for 2024 is 1.71x sales. That is very low. This means that at 7.4x $402 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $2.975 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is $3.35 billion. That is 215% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion. Unadjusted fair share price: 3.35Bn/82.5M = $40.61 Adjusted: We need to adjust the 2024 numbers to derive their present value. At a 15% discount rate for 4 years, the 2024 sales are worth 57.175% of this in today’s dollars. The present value sales number is $230 million (i.e., $402 million times 57.175%). As a result, the adjusted EV-sales multiple is 3x (i.e., $689 million EV divided by $230 million). This means that at 7.4x $230 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $1.702 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is $2.077 billion. That is 95.2% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion. Adjusted fair share price: 2.077Bn/82.5M = $25.2 Average between adjusted and unadjusted: Target market value is $2.713 billion. Fair share price: $32.89 Conclusion: EXPC stock is worth at least 154% more than its present price of $12.9 (As of 03/14/2021) This is without accounting all the hype from the merger announcement. Joby - RTP (Speculation) It's difficult to value this stock since all the revenue projections are subject to a lot of variables (Timely certification, customer acquisition, production delays, etc.) Yet, I am long term bullish on this stock. With almost $2 billion in capital on-hand, the Elevate team, and Toyota as a manufacturing partner, Bevirt’s company has everything it needs to achieve his vision of saving a billion people an hour a day. Check Ehang (Chinese competitor) stock's trajectory over past 6 months. Clear that there's a lot of excitement surrounding eVTOLs and the news of merger should send this stock soaring in next few months. ARKX ETF is slated to launch end of this month and RTP is a great match for Cathie Wood's sub-orbital space category. How I am playing EXPC and RTP Catalysts: ARKX ETF launch EOM makes both EXPC and RTP a great spec play EXPC - A lot of spec predictions floating around about the shareholder vote on 3/31 Post NASDAQ sell-off was brutal for all SPACs and especially EXPC and RTP but these stocks are bound to rebound. Positions: 30 calls for 05/21 at $20 strike price, 18 calls for 8/20 at $25 strike price. I am tempted to pick up 04/16 $30 calls tomorrow. I don't have any RTP shares/calls but I might pick up a few calls tomorrow as well. Note that I am only playing catalysts at this point but may buy shares for RTP for long term investment (>5years). I find advent of eVTOLs super exciting. Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, heck this is my first time writing a DD so what do I even know about investing. Do your own DD and most importantly, let me know if I've got any part of the thesis glaringly wrong.

,"Tl;dr: EXPC stock is worth at least 154% more than its present price of $12.9 (As of 03/14/2021). Both EXPC and RTP have significant catalysts lined up ahead that will likely boost the SP from current lows post-NASDAQ sell-off. What to expect Understanding the eVTOL Space Outlook for EXPC and RTP SPAC Transaction Summary What Blade/ EXPC and Joby/ RTP Stocks are Worth How I am playing EXPC and RTP Useful Links Understanding the eVTOL Space (Note: Skip to next section if you feel reading this background info is a drag) Before I even start discussing tickers and plays, I'd first like to shed some light on the groundbreaking Urban Air Mobility (UAM) space, where it's heading and who are the top players vying for the bigger piece of the pie. Understanding the potential investment opportunities without understanding this nascent space is a mooo point. Electric VTOL (Vertical Take off & Landing) air taxis are one of the great emerging technologies of our time, promising to unlock the skies as traffic-free, high-speed, 3D commuting routes. Much quieter and cheaper than helicopter travel, they'll also run on zero-local-emission electric power, and many models suggest they'll cost around the same per mile as a ground-based ride share. Currently there are over 100 players around the globe (check this article to get an overview of some the key players in the eVTOL space) in various stages of designing, building and commercializing eVTOL airframes. As is the case with any disruptive industry, the development and production of eVTOLs is an insanely cash hungry undertaking. Currently, we've a handful of frontrunners around the world who have gone public (Chinese eVTOL $EH) or are ripe to go public soon. Here's a the link to a well rounded DD comparing RTP-ACIC-EXPC-EH-Volo-Lilium that I highly recommend checking out. The United States is acutely aware that it 'missed the boat' on consumer drones, and it's an understandably sore point. But perhaps more importantly the geopolitical consequences of Chinese drone dominance appear to have reverberated around the corridors of the Pentagon for some time. One consequence of this situation is that the latest area of rapid aerospace innovation - eVTOL - has firmly captured the attention of US industry, investors and now the Department of Defense. Leaders of all stripes Stateside are determined that America will indeed be 'first' in this new and exciting area of aerospace innovation. The Air Force recently launched Agility Prime, a non-traditional program seeking to accelerate the commercial market for advanced air mobility vehicles (i.e., ""flying cars""). Check their website here and highly recommend reading this Wired article by USAF's former Acquisition Executive, Will Roper who starts his argument by drawing inspiration from the Jetsons. The outlook for UAM looks positive based on increasing congestion in cities. There are various estimates of the TAM (total addressable market) of UAM. In its presentation, Archer Aviation said that it expects a TAM of $1.5 trillion for UAM, which stretches to $3 trillion in the optimistic scenario. Joby Aviation said that it sees the TAM for UAM at $1 trillion globally and $500 billion in the U.S. Joby Aviation cited the 2018 UAM Market Study from Booz Allen Hamilton for its forecasts. Now, What's stopping us from having eVTOL air taxis today, then? Here are some of the factors you should be considering while evaluating potential investment opportunities: Batteries!! - Battery manufacturers' roadmaps are currently focused on satiating EV manufacturers and developing battery packs with required energy density and specific power (i.e. ability to sustain Tesla's ludicrous mode for a few minutes v/s a few seconds) could take a few years. Alakai Skai's (currently supported by a single private investor) decision however, to ditch lithium batteries for a liquid hydrogen powertrain completely eliminates the battery technology bottleneck that almost every other company is hoping will resolve itself by the time they launch commercial services Certification - These are entirely new categories of aircraft, and the process of certifying, testing and regulating them is going to be monstrously expensive and time consuming. Federal support and urgency to outcompete global players should help the cause. Safety - To coordinate their thrust, each of the electric motor and fan units will need reliable sensors to accurately measure pressure, temperature and other indicators. Each of the motors will induce vibrations in the wings, and their fans may not all spin with the same efficiencies as wear and tear set in. It will be complicated to write software to reliably control all that, says Ella Atkins, an aerospace engineering professor at the University of Michigan. While Atkins says she doesn’t see anything that’s “absolutely a showstopper” with the design, she thinks the many years it took to solve the deadly control problems of the first tiltrotor aircraft, the U.S. military’s V-22 Osprey, offers a sobering parallel for Lilium and other EVTOL developers. “You need a lot of money and time to be successful in aerospace, and the truth is, this industry is trying to go too fast,” says Atkins. Next issue is use of ballistic parachutes. Ballistic parachutes can only save you above a certain altitude, maybe 120 feet or so. Below that, they don't have time to open up, which means that every time you take off or land in one of these machines, you're exposed to a window of time in which total system failure would drop you like a stone. Air Traffic Control - Down the track, there will also have to be a considerable leap forward in air traffic control if the skies are going to safely hold large numbers of these machines zipping about between a bunch of skyports/ vertiports dotted around an urban area. Public Perception - Public perception (trust and safety in tech) is a large obstacle. Safety is the greatest concern with “unruly” passengers, “lasing” of pilots, and aircraft sabotage being main contributors. New importance of travel time, increase in telecommuting, urbanization and de-congestion scenarios could reduce the viability of UAM markets. Advancement in driverless car tech will likely make UAMs suitable for long-distance commute only. All these problems are being worked on, and now we are ready to discuss 2 important SPAC plays that I have rounded up for investment in this space: Joby Aviation - $RTP (eVTOL Manufacturer | Long term play) Blade - $EXPC (eVTOL Asset Light Platform, aka 'Uber of skies'| Short-Mid term play) Outlook for EXPC and RTP Blade - EXPC Investor's presentation Blade is an eVTOL index play, often thought as the ""Uber of skies"" operates by connecting contract pilots with passengers to generate revenue via their proprietary platform.

SPAC Transaction Summary Blade - EXPC (Investor's presentation) The transaction will be funded by a combination of EIC ($EXPC) cash held in a trust account and proceeds from a $125m PIPE, of which KSL has committed to subscribing for ~$20m PF shares outstanding: 82.5 million Transaction reflects pro forma market capitalization of $1.604 billion (The share price as I'm writing this is $12.9) Transaction will result in $375m of cash to balance sheet to fund growth Transaction implies a fully diluted pro forma equity value of $689.25m for Blade Existing Blade shareholders expected to receive 43.2% of the pro forma equity The boards of directors of both Blade and Experience Investment Corp. have unanimously approved the proposed transaction. The transaction is expected to close in 1H 2021; predictions expect voting to happen in the last week of March/first week of April. Form 8-K Joby - RTP (Investor's presentation) PF shares outstanding: 660 million The pro forma implied market capitalization of the combined company is $6.6 billion, at the $10.00 per share PIPE subscription price and assuming no public shareholders of Reinvent exercise their redemption rights. The Company will receive at the time of transaction close up to $690 million in proceeds from Reinvent’s cash in trust and an $835 million private placement of common stock at a $10.00 per share value and will also convert a $75 million convertible note into common stock at a $10.00 per share value. Pro-forma for the transaction, Joby expects to have up to $1.974Bn of cash to fund growth and commercialize its operations Transaction implies a fully diluted pro-forma aggregate value of $4.6Bn (2.3x AV / 2026E Revenue) Existing Joby shareholders to roll 100% of their equity and expected to receive 76% of the pro-forma equity Up to five-year lock-up on founder shares. Major stockholders and key executives of Joby have agreed to enter into separate lockup agreements as well. Price-based vesting triggers of $12, $18, $24, $32 and $50 per share on founder shares The boards of directors of both Reinvent and Joby have unanimously approved the transaction, which is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2021. Form 8-K What Blade/ EXPC and Joby/ RTP Stocks are Worth Blade - EXPC PF shares outstanding: 82.5 million EXPC SP as of 03/14: $12.9 SPAC Cash = $375MM 82.5MM * $12.9/share = 1.064Bn PF Market Cap PF EV is = $689MM (PF Market Cap - SPAC Cash) Disruptive technology platforms have an average EV-sales ratio of 8.2x. In addition, luxury brands are at 7.5x and recent EV / SPAC mobility deals have averaged 6.5x. The average of all four of these groups of stocks is 7.4x. On page 37 of the presentation, Blade shows the EV-sales ratios of four groups of its peers. Unadjusted: 2024 estimated revenue is expected to be $402MM (Blade isn't accounting any eVTOL revenue, international expansion, operational upside or any strategic upside in this number). This means that the unadjusted EV-sales ratio for 2024 is 1.71x sales. That is very low. This means that at 7.4x $402 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $2.975 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is $3.35 billion. That is 215% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion. Unadjusted fair share price: 3.35Bn/82.5M = $40.61 Adjusted: We need to adjust the 2024 numbers to derive their present value. At a 15% discount rate for 4 years, the 2024 sales are worth 57.175% of this in today’s dollars. The present value sales number is $230 million (i.e., $402 million times 57.175%). As a result, the adjusted EV-sales multiple is 3x (i.e., $689 million EV divided by $230 million). This means that at 7.4x $230 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $1.702 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is $2.077 billion. That is 95.2% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion. Adjusted fair share price: 2.077Bn/82.5M = $25.2 Average between adjusted and unadjusted: Target market value is $2.713 billion. Fair share price: $32.89 Conclusion: EXPC stock is worth at least 154% more than its present price of $12.9 (As of 03/14/2021) This is without accounting all the hype from the merger announcement. Joby - RTP (Speculation) It's difficult to value this stock since all the revenue projections are subject to a lot of variables (Timely certification, customer acquisition, production delays, etc.) Yet, I am long term bullish on this stock. With almost $2 billion in capital on-hand, the Elevate team, and Toyota as a manufacturing partner, Bevirt’s company has everything it needs to achieve his vision of saving a billion people an hour a day. Check Ehang (Chinese competitor) stock's trajectory over past 6 months. Clear that there's a lot of excitement surrounding eVTOLs and the news of merger should send this stock soaring in next few months. ARKX ETF is slated to launch end of this month and RTP is a great match for Cathie Wood's sub-orbital space category. How I am playing EXPC and RTP Catalysts: ARKX ETF launch EOM makes both EXPC and RTP a great spec play EXPC - A lot of spec predictions floating around about the shareholder vote on 3/31 Post NASDAQ sell-off was brutal for all SPACs and especially EXPC and RTP but these stocks are bound to rebound. Positions: 30 calls for 05/21 at $20 strike price, 18 calls for 8/20 at $25 strike price. I am tempted to pick up 04/16 $30 calls tomorrow. I don't have any RTP shares/calls but I might pick up a few calls tomorrow as well. Note that I am only playing catalysts at this point but may buy shares for RTP for long term investment (>5years). I find advent of eVTOLs super exciting. Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, heck this is my first time writing a DD so what do I even know about investing.

,"Tl;dr: EXPC stock is worth at least 154% more than its present price of $12.9 (As of 03/14/2021). Both EXPC and RTP have significant catalysts lined up ahead that will likely boost the SP from current lows post-NASDAQ sell-off. What to expect Understanding the eVTOL Space Outlook for EXPC and RTP SPAC Transaction Summary What Blade/ EXPC and Joby/ RTP Stocks are Worth How I am playing EXPC and RTP Useful Links Understanding the eVTOL Space (Note: Skip to next section if you feel reading this background info is a drag) Before I even start discussing tickers and plays, I'd first like to shed some light on the groundbreaking Urban Air Mobility (UAM) space, where it's heading and who are the top players vying for the bigger piece of the pie. Understanding the potential investment opportunities without understanding this nascent space is a mooo point. Electric VTOL (Vertical Take off & Landing) air taxis are one of the great emerging technologies of our time, promising to unlock the skies as traffic-free, high-speed, 3D commuting routes. Much quieter and cheaper than helicopter travel, they'll also run on zero-local-emission electric power, and many models suggest they'll cost around the same per mile as a ground-based ride share. Currently there are over 100 players around the globe (check this article to get an overview of some the key players in the eVTOL space) in various stages of designing, building and commercializing eVTOL airframes. As is the case with any disruptive industry, the development and production of eVTOLs is an insanely cash hungry undertaking. Currently, we've a handful of frontrunners around the world who have gone public (Chinese eVTOL $EH) or are ripe to go public soon. Here's a the link to a well rounded DD comparing RTP-ACIC-EXPC-EH-Volo-Lilium that I highly recommend checking out. The United States is acutely aware that it 'missed the boat' on consumer drones, and it's an understandably sore point. But perhaps more importantly the geopolitical consequences of Chinese drone dominance appear to have reverberated around the corridors of the Pentagon for some time. One consequence of this situation is that the latest area of rapid aerospace innovation - eVTOL - has firmly captured the attention of US industry, investors and now the Department of Defense. Leaders of all stripes Stateside are determined that America will indeed be 'first' in this new and exciting area of aerospace innovation. The Air Force recently launched Agility Prime, a non-traditional program seeking to accelerate the commercial market for advanced air mobility vehicles (i.e., ""flying cars""). Check their website here and highly recommend reading this Wired article by USAF's former Acquisition Executive, Will Roper who starts his argument by drawing inspiration from the Jetsons. The outlook for UAM looks positive based on increasing congestion in cities. There are various estimates of the TAM (total addressable market) of UAM. In its presentation, Archer Aviation said that it expects a TAM of $1.5 trillion for UAM, which stretches to $3 trillion in the optimistic scenario. Joby Aviation said that it sees the TAM for UAM at $1 trillion globally and $500 billion in the U.S. Joby Aviation cited the 2018 UAM Market Study from Booz Allen Hamilton for its forecasts. Now, What's stopping us from having eVTOL air taxis today, then? Here are some of the factors you should be considering while evaluating potential investment opportunities: Batteries!! - Battery manufacturers' roadmaps are currently focused on satiating EV manufacturers and developing battery packs with required energy density and specific power (i.e. ability to sustain Tesla's ludicrous mode for a few minutes v/s a few seconds) could take a few years. Alakai Skai's (currently supported by a single private investor) decision however, to ditch lithium batteries for a liquid hydrogen powertrain completely eliminates the battery technology bottleneck that almost every other company is hoping will resolve itself by the time they launch commercial services Certification - These are entirely new categories of aircraft, and the process of certifying, testing and regulating them is going to be monstrously expensive and time consuming. Federal support and urgency to outcompete global players should help the cause. Safety - To coordinate their thrust, each of the electric motor and fan units will need reliable sensors to accurately measure pressure, temperature and other indicators. Each of the motors will induce vibrations in the wings, and their fans may not all spin with the same efficiencies as wear and tear set in. It will be complicated to write software to reliably control all that, says Ella Atkins, an aerospace engineering professor at the University of Michigan. While Atkins says she doesn’t see anything that’s “absolutely a showstopper” with the design, she thinks the many years it took to solve the deadly control problems of the first tiltrotor aircraft, the U.S. military’s V-22 Osprey, offers a sobering parallel for Lilium and other EVTOL developers. “You need a lot of money and time to be successful in aerospace, and the truth is, this industry is trying to go too fast,” says Atkins. Next issue is use of ballistic parachutes. Ballistic parachutes can only save you above a certain altitude, maybe 120 feet or so. Below that, they don't have time to open up, which means that every time you take off or land in one of these machines, you're exposed to a window of time in which total system failure would drop you like a stone. Air Traffic Control - Down the track, there will also have to be a considerable leap forward in air traffic control if the skies are going to safely hold large numbers of these machines zipping about between a bunch of skyports/ vertiports dotted around an urban area. Public Perception - Public perception (trust and safety in tech) is a large obstacle. Safety is the greatest concern with “unruly” passengers, “lasing” of pilots, and aircraft sabotage being main contributors. New importance of travel time, increase in telecommuting, urbanization and de-congestion scenarios could reduce the viability of UAM markets. Advancement in driverless car tech will likely make UAMs suitable for long-distance commute only. All these problems are being worked on, and now we are ready to discuss 2 important SPAC plays that I have rounded up for investment in this space: Joby Aviation - $RTP (eVTOL Manufacturer | Long term play) Blade - $EXPC (eVTOL Asset Light Platform, aka 'Uber of skies'| Short-Mid term play) Outlook for EXPC and RTP Blade - EXPC Investor's presentation Blade is an eVTOL index play, often thought as the ""Uber of skies"" operates by connecting contract pilots with passengers to generate revenue via their proprietary platform. Blade’s business model is proven and is profitable; eVTOL is expected to improve unit economics and dramatically expand the addressable market of BLADE’s existing products. There are currently 167 different eVTOL aircraft under development. Blade is 1 of 1 asset light platform — poised to benefit regardless of which eVTOL manufacturer is first to market. Basically, Blade's strategy is akin to selling shovels in a gold rush. Rob Wiesenthal, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Blade, commented, “Ground mobility has been radically transformed by software and battery technology, as evidenced by the rapid adoption of electric vehicles. The next battle is in the air. This transaction provides the capital for Blade to profitably expand its urban air mobility business using conventional rotorcraft today, while providing a seamless transition to EVA aircraft tomorrow.” Blade and KSL have already identified around $300 million in short- to mid-term investment opportunities that will help Blade expand its presence in the northeastern United States, on the West Coast in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and in new markets that could include Vancouver, Jakarta, and Tokyo. (EXPC is sponsored by an affiliate of KSL Capital Partners, making the EXPC<>Blade strategic merger even more prudent). Blade operates in four key lines of business: Short Distance – Flights between 60 and 100 miles in distance, primarily servicing commuters for prices between $595 and $795 per seat (or $295 for monthly commuter pass holders). BLADE Airport – Flights between all New York area airports and dedicated Blade lounges in Manhattan’s heliports. Prices start at $195 per seat (or $95 per seat with the purchase of an annual Airport Pass)1 . BLADE MediMobility – Blade is the largest transporter of human organs in the Northeast United States, reducing the costs and transport time for hospitals versus legacy competitors. This business is a critical part of the Company’s growth strategy as organ movements are expected to be one of the first uses of EVA, before flights for passengers. International Joint Ventures – As part of its expansion strategy, the Company forms joint ventures with local partners in key overseas markets to provide the technology, customer experience, infrastructure design, and employee training, that enables a scalable and consistent Blade experience. Blade’s first international joint venture launched helicopter services late last year in India flying between Mumbai, Pune, and Shirdi. The Company expects to use proceeds from the transaction to fund expansion into new markets, including the Northeast Corridor and West Coast in the United States, as well as target addressable markets internationally (Vancouver, Jakarta and Tokyo). Blade's projected revenue outlook: Blade estimates its revenue in 2021 will reach $52 million. Moreover, by 2023, Blade estimates revenue will reach $181 million and $402 million by the end of 2024. This is all still before significant revenues occur from eVTOL which the company calls Phase 3 starting in 2025 and 2026. It does not assume any passenger eVTOL revenue before then. But in Phase 3, revenue is forecast to skyrocket to $601 million in 2025 and $875 million in 2026. (These numbers should be considered with a grain of salt) Blade's Competitive Moat: BLADE’s first mover advantage, extensive and loyal customer base and control of strategic infrastructure secures its leading position in the future of urban air mobility. #1 market share in key short-distance aviation markets, brings credibility to new market expansion. Strong management team with domain expertise and public market experience. BLADE is already slated to leverage and partner with KSL’s portfolio companies to generate attractive growth opportunities. Proprietary technologies and asset-light model enables flight volume growth and accelerates launch timeline for new markets While Joby Aviation - Uber partnership pose a significant competitive threat, it's worth noting that Uber Elevate failed to take off even with its branding and it'll be challenging for Joby to front the customer acquisition cost (after bleeding dry with production upscaling and certification costs) and outcompete Blade who have an edge in that domain with their ever growing loyal customer base. Another point to note is that Joby will be limited to their own aircrafts while Blade is already scanning potential players and will likely partner with different eVTOL operators depending on the nature of routes. ARKQ is holding 2,748,457 shares, which represents 9.99% of public float for EXPC. Once the merger is complete, there will be a total of 82.5M shares. This means ARK currently own 2.9% of the 82.5M shares. Leadership: Upon completion of the transaction, the combined company will continue to be led by Mr. Wiesenthal as Chief Executive Officer. The senior management team will also include Will Heyburn, Chief Financial Officer and Head of Corporate Development, Brandon Keene, Chief Technology Officer, and Melissa Tomkiel, General Counsel.

Joby Aviation - RTP Investor's presentation Fact Sheet Company has spent more than a decade developing piloted, all-electric, vertical takeoff and landing passenger aircraft, with over 1,000 test flights conducted to date. Intends to operate clean, quiet and affordable air taxi service starting in 2024; with a vision to offer flights at the same price as a ground-based taxi. First company to agree certification basis for an eVTOL aircraft with FAA First company to be granted airworthiness approval for an eVTOL aircraft by U.S. Air Force Company has strategic partnership with Toyota for production and recently acquired Uber Elevate and will be partnering with Uber for go-to-market and demand generation. Other partners include: Agility Prime - A USAF program that will provide Joby access to key research facilities and equipment and allows us to prove out the maturity and reliability of our aircraft. Toray - Joby Aviation and Toray Advanced Composites completed a long-term supply agreement for the composite material used for Joby’s aircraft. Garmin - Garmin will be providing their state-of-the-art G3000 integrated flight deck to Joby for our aircraft. The G3000 integrated flight deck has been reliably demonstrated across a variety of aircraft and brings seamless integration for the unique requirements of eVTOL aircraft. In 10 years, Joby’s presentation to investors projects a presence in over 20 cities worldwide with 14,000 aircraft in service generating more than $20 billion in revenue — electric air mobility at scale around the world. Up to five-year lock-up agreement and price-based vesting on certain sponsor shares ensures unprecedented long-term alignment, with some shares not vesting until Company achieves $30 billion market capitalization. Proceeds are expected to fund Company through start of passenger service launch, including certification of aircraft and development of manufacturing facilities.

,"Tl;dr: EXPC stock is worth at least 154% more than its present price of $12.9 (As of 03/14/2021). Both EXPC and RTP have significant catalysts lined up ahead that will likely boost the SP from current lows post-NASDAQ sell-off. What to expect Understanding the eVTOL Space Outlook for EXPC and RTP SPAC Transaction Summary What Blade/ EXPC and Joby/ RTP Stocks are Worth How I am playing EXPC and RTP Useful Links Understanding the eVTOL Space (Note: Skip to next section if you feel reading this background info is a drag) Before I even start discussing tickers and plays, I'd first like to shed some light on the groundbreaking Urban Air Mobility (UAM) space, where it's heading and who are the top players vying for the bigger piece of the pie. Understanding the potential investment opportunities without understanding this nascent space is a mooo point. Electric VTOL (Vertical Take off & Landing) air taxis are one of the great emerging technologies of our time, promising to unlock the skies as traffic-free, high-speed, 3D commuting routes. Much quieter and cheaper than helicopter travel, they'll also run on zero-local-emission electric power, and many models suggest they'll cost around the same per mile as a ground-based ride share. Currently there are over 100 players around the globe (check this article to get an overview of some the key players in the eVTOL space) in various stages of designing, building and commercializing eVTOL airframes. As is the case with any disruptive industry, the development and production of eVTOLs is an insanely cash hungry undertaking. Currently, we've a handful of frontrunners around the world who have gone public (Chinese eVTOL $EH) or are ripe to go public soon. Here's a the link to a well rounded DD comparing RTP-ACIC-EXPC-EH-Volo-Lilium that I highly recommend checking out. The United States is acutely aware that it 'missed the boat' on consumer drones, and it's an understandably sore point. But perhaps more importantly the geopolitical consequences of Chinese drone dominance appear to have reverberated around the corridors of the Pentagon for some time. One consequence of this situation is that the latest area of rapid aerospace innovation - eVTOL - has firmly captured the attention of US industry, investors and now the Department of Defense. Leaders of all stripes Stateside are determined that America will indeed be 'first' in this new and exciting area of aerospace innovation. The Air Force recently launched Agility Prime, a non-traditional program seeking to accelerate the commercial market for advanced air mobility vehicles (i.e., ""flying cars""). Check their website here and highly recommend reading this Wired article by USAF's former Acquisition Executive, Will Roper who starts his argument by drawing inspiration from the Jetsons. The outlook for UAM looks positive based on increasing congestion in cities. There are various estimates of the TAM (total addressable market) of UAM. In its presentation, Archer Aviation said that it expects a TAM of $1.5 trillion for UAM, which stretches to $3 trillion in the optimistic scenario. Joby Aviation said that it sees the TAM for UAM at $1 trillion globally and $500 billion in the U.S. Joby Aviation cited the 2018 UAM Market Study from Booz Allen Hamilton for its forecasts. Now, What's stopping us from having eVTOL air taxis today, then? Here are some of the factors you should be considering while evaluating potential investment opportunities: Batteries!! - Battery manufacturers' roadmaps are currently focused on satiating EV manufacturers and developing battery packs with required energy density and specific power (i.e. ability to sustain Tesla's ludicrous mode for a few minutes v/s a few seconds) could take a few years. Alakai Skai's (currently supported by a single private investor) decision however, to ditch lithium batteries for a liquid hydrogen powertrain completely eliminates the battery technology bottleneck that almost every other company is hoping will resolve itself by the time they launch commercial services Certification - These are entirely new categories of aircraft, and the process of certifying, testing and regulating them is going to be monstrously expensive and time consuming. Federal support and urgency to outcompete global players should help the cause. Safety - To coordinate their thrust, each of the electric motor and fan units will need reliable sensors to accurately measure pressure, temperature and other indicators. Each of the motors will induce vibrations in the wings, and their fans may not all spin with the same efficiencies as wear and tear set in. It will be complicated to write software to reliably control all that, says Ella Atkins, an aerospace engineering professor at the University of Michigan. While Atkins says she doesn’t see anything that’s “absolutely a showstopper” with the design, she thinks the many years it took to solve the deadly control problems of the first tiltrotor aircraft, the U.S. military’s V-22 Osprey, offers a sobering parallel for Lilium and other EVTOL developers. “You need a lot of money and time to be successful in aerospace, and the truth is, this industry is trying to go too fast,” says Atkins. Next issue is use of ballistic parachutes. Ballistic parachutes can only save you above a certain altitude, maybe 120 feet or so. Below that, they don't have time to open up, which means that every time you take off or land in one of these machines, you're exposed to a window of time in which total system failure would drop you like a stone. Air Traffic Control - Down the track, there will also have to be a considerable leap forward in air traffic control if the skies are going to safely hold large numbers of these machines zipping about between a bunch of skyports/ vertiports dotted around an urban area. Public Perception - Public perception (trust and safety in tech) is a large obstacle. Safety is the greatest concern with “unruly” passengers, “lasing” of pilots, and aircraft sabotage being main contributors. New importance of travel time, increase in telecommuting, urbanization and de-congestion scenarios could reduce the viability of UAM markets. Advancement in driverless car tech will likely make UAMs suitable for long-distance commute only. All these problems are being worked on, and now we are ready to discuss 2 important SPAC plays that I have rounded up for investment in this space: Joby Aviation - $RTP (eVTOL Manufacturer | Long term play) Blade - $EXPC (eVTOL Asset Light Platform, aka 'Uber of skies'| Short-Mid term play) Outlook for EXPC and RTP Blade - EXPC Investor's presentation Blade is an eVTOL index play, often thought as the ""Uber of skies"" operates by connecting contract pilots with passengers to generate revenue via their proprietary platform. Blade’s business model is proven and is profitable; eVTOL is expected to improve unit economics and dramatically expand the addressable market of BLADE’s existing products. There are currently 167 different eVTOL aircraft under development. Blade is 1 of 1 asset light platform — poised to benefit regardless of which eVTOL manufacturer is first to market. Basically, Blade's strategy is akin to selling shovels in a gold rush. Rob Wiesenthal, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Blade, commented, “Ground mobility has been radically transformed by software and battery technology, as evidenced by the rapid adoption of electric vehicles. The next battle is in the air. This transaction provides the capital for Blade to profitably expand its urban air mobility business using conventional rotorcraft today, while providing a seamless transition to EVA aircraft tomorrow.” Blade and KSL have already identified around $300 million in short- to mid-term investment opportunities that will help Blade expand its presence in the northeastern United States, on the West Coast in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and in new markets that could include Vancouver, Jakarta, and Tokyo. (EXPC is sponsored by an affiliate of KSL Capital Partners, making the EXPC<>Blade strategic merger even more prudent). Blade operates in four key lines of business: Short Distance – Flights between 60 and 100 miles in distance, primarily servicing commuters for prices between $595 and $795 per seat (or $295 for monthly commuter pass holders). BLADE Airport – Flights between all New York area airports and dedicated Blade lounges in Manhattan’s heliports. Prices start at $195 per seat (or $95 per seat with the purchase of an annual Airport Pass)1 . BLADE MediMobility – Blade is the largest transporter of human organs in the Northeast United States, reducing the costs and transport time for hospitals versus legacy competitors. This business is a critical part of the Company’s growth strategy as organ movements are expected to be one of the first uses of EVA, before flights for passengers. International Joint Ventures – As part of its expansion strategy, the Company forms joint ventures with local partners in key overseas markets to provide the technology, customer experience, infrastructure design, and employee training, that enables a scalable and consistent Blade experience. Blade’s first international joint venture launched helicopter services late last year in India flying between Mumbai, Pune, and Shirdi. The Company expects to use proceeds from the transaction to fund expansion into new markets, including the Northeast Corridor and West Coast in the United States, as well as target addressable markets internationally (Vancouver, Jakarta and Tokyo). Blade's projected revenue outlook: Blade estimates its revenue in 2021 will reach $52 million. Moreover, by 2023, Blade estimates revenue will reach $181 million and $402 million by the end of 2024. This is all still before significant revenues occur from eVTOL which the company calls Phase 3 starting in 2025 and 2026. It does not assume any passenger eVTOL revenue before then. But in Phase 3, revenue is forecast to skyrocket to $601 million in 2025 and $875 million in 2026. (These numbers should be considered with a grain of salt) Blade's Competitive Moat: BLADE’s first mover advantage, extensive and loyal customer base and control of strategic infrastructure secures its leading position in the future of urban air mobility. #1 market share in key short-distance aviation markets, brings credibility to new market expansion. Strong management team with domain expertise and public market experience. BLADE is already slated to leverage and partner with KSL’s portfolio companies to generate attractive growth opportunities. Proprietary technologies and asset-light model enables flight volume growth and accelerates launch timeline for new markets While Joby Aviation - Uber partnership pose a significant competitive threat, it's worth noting that Uber Elevate failed to take off even with its branding and it'll be challenging for Joby to front the customer acquisition cost (after bleeding dry with production upscaling and certification costs) and outcompete Blade who have an edge in that domain with their ever growing loyal customer base. Another point to note is that Joby will be limited to their own aircrafts while Blade is already scanning potential players and will likely partner with different eVTOL operators depending on the nature of routes. ARKQ is holding 2,748,457 shares, which represents 9.99% of public float for EXPC. Once the merger is complete, there will be a total of 82.5M shares. This means ARK currently own 2.9% of the 82.5M shares. Leadership: Upon completion of the transaction, the combined company will continue to be led by Mr. Wiesenthal as Chief Executive Officer. The senior management team will also include Will Heyburn, Chief Financial Officer and Head of Corporate Development, Brandon Keene, Chief Technology Officer, and Melissa Tomkiel, General Counsel.

Joby Aviation - RTP Investor's presentation Fact Sheet Company has spent more than a decade developing piloted, all-electric, vertical takeoff and landing passenger aircraft, with over 1,000 test flights conducted to date. Intends to operate clean, quiet and affordable air taxi service starting in 2024; with a vision to offer flights at the same price as a ground-based taxi. First company to agree certification basis for an eVTOL aircraft with FAA First company to be granted airworthiness approval for an eVTOL aircraft by U.S. Air Force Company has strategic partnership with Toyota for production and recently acquired Uber Elevate and will be partnering with Uber for go-to-market and demand generation. Other partners include: Agility Prime - A USAF program that will provide Joby access to key research facilities and equipment and allows us to prove out the maturity and reliability of our aircraft. Toray - Joby Aviation and Toray Advanced Composites completed a long-term supply agreement for the composite material used for Joby’s aircraft. Garmin - Garmin will be providing their state-of-the-art G3000 integrated flight deck to Joby for our aircraft. The G3000 integrated flight deck has been reliably demonstrated across a variety of aircraft and brings seamless integration for the unique requirements of eVTOL aircraft. In 10 years, Joby’s presentation to investors projects a presence in over 20 cities worldwide with 14,000 aircraft in service generating more than $20 billion in revenue — electric air mobility at scale around the world. Up to five-year lock-up agreement and price-based vesting on certain sponsor shares ensures unprecedented long-term alignment, with some shares not vesting until Company achieves $30 billion market capitalization. Proceeds are expected to fund Company through start of passenger service launch, including certification of aircraft and development of manufacturing facilities.

SPAC Transaction Summary Blade - EXPC (Investor's presentation) The transaction will be funded by a combination of EIC ($EXPC) cash held in a trust account and proceeds from a $125m PIPE, of which KSL has committed to subscribing for ~$20m PF shares outstanding: 82.5 million Transaction reflects pro forma market capitalization of $1.604 billion (The share price as I'm writing this is $12.9) Transaction will result in $375m of cash to balance sheet to fund growth Transaction implies a fully diluted pro forma equity value of $689.25m for Blade Existing Blade shareholders expected to receive 43.2% of the pro forma equity The boards of directors of both Blade and Experience Investment Corp. have unanimously approved the proposed transaction. The transaction is expected to close in 1H 2021; predictions expect voting to happen in the last week of March/first week of April. Form 8-K Joby - RTP (Investor's presentation) PF shares outstanding: 660 million The pro forma implied market capitalization of the combined company is $6.6 billion, at the $10.00 per share PIPE subscription price and assuming no public shareholders of Reinvent exercise their redemption rights. The Company will receive at the time of transaction close up to $690 million in proceeds from Reinvent’s cash in trust and an $835 million private placement of common stock at a $10.00 per share value and will also convert a $75 million convertible note into common stock at a $10.00 per share value. Pro-forma for the transaction, Joby expects to have up to $1.974Bn of cash to fund growth and commercialize its operations Transaction implies a fully diluted pro-forma aggregate value of $4.6Bn (2.3x AV / 2026E Revenue) Existing Joby shareholders to roll 100% of their equity and expected to receive 76% of the pro-forma equity Up to five-year lock-up on founder shares. Major stockholders and key executives of Joby have agreed to enter into separate lockup agreements as well. Price-based vesting triggers of $12, $18, $24, $32 and $50 per share on founder shares The boards of directors of both Reinvent and Joby have unanimously approved the transaction, which is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2021. Form 8-K What Blade/ EXPC and Joby/ RTP Stocks are Worth Blade - EXPC PF shares outstanding: 82.5 million EXPC SP as of 03/14: $12.9 SPAC Cash = $375MM 82.5MM * $12.9/share = 1.064Bn PF Market Cap PF EV is = $689MM (PF Market Cap - SPAC Cash) Disruptive technology platforms have an average EV-sales ratio of 8.2x. In addition, luxury brands are at 7.5x and recent EV / SPAC mobility deals have averaged 6.5x. The average of all four of these groups of stocks is 7.4x. On page 37 of the presentation, Blade shows the EV-sales ratios of four groups of its peers. Unadjusted: 2024 estimated revenue is expected to be $402MM (Blade isn't accounting any eVTOL revenue, international expansion, operational upside or any strategic upside in this number). This means that the unadjusted EV-sales ratio for 2024 is 1.71x sales. That is very low. This means that at 7.4x $402 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $2.975 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is $3.35 billion. That is 215% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion. Unadjusted fair share price: 3.35Bn/82.5M = $40.61 Adjusted: We need to adjust the 2024 numbers to derive their present value. At a 15% discount rate for 4 years, the 2024 sales are worth 57.175% of this in today’s dollars. The present value sales number is $230 million (i.e., $402 million times 57.175%). As a result, the adjusted EV-sales multiple is 3x (i.e., $689 million EV divided by $230 million). This means that at 7.4x $230 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $1.702 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is $2.077 billion. That is 95.2% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion. Adjusted fair share price: 2.077Bn/82.5M = $25.2 Average between adjusted and unadjusted: Target market value is $2.713 billion. Fair share price: $32.89 Conclusion: EXPC stock is worth at least 154% more than its present price of $12.9 (As of 03/14/2021) This is without accounting all the hype from the merger announcement. Joby - RTP (Speculation) It's difficult to value this stock since all the revenue projections are subject to a lot of variables (Timely certification, customer acquisition, production delays, etc.) Yet, I am long term bullish on this stock. With almost $2 billion in capital on-hand, the Elevate team, and Toyota as a manufacturing partner, Bevirt’s company has everything it needs to achieve his vision of saving a billion people an hour a day. Check Ehang (Chinese competitor) stock's trajectory over past 6 months. Clear that there's a lot of excitement surrounding eVTOLs and the news of merger should send this stock soaring in next few months. ARKX ETF is slated to launch end of this month and RTP is a great match for Cathie Wood's sub-orbital space category. How I am playing EXPC and RTP Catalysts: ARKX ETF launch EOM makes both EXPC and RTP a great spec play EXPC - A lot of spec predictions floating around about the shareholder vote on 3/31 Post NASDAQ sell-off was brutal for all SPACs and especially EXPC and RTP but these stocks are bound to rebound. Positions: 30 calls for 05/21 at $20 strike price, 18 calls for 8/20 at $25 strike price. I am tempted to pick up 04/16 $30 calls tomorrow. I don't have any RTP shares/calls but I might pick up a few calls tomorrow as well. Note that I am only playing catalysts at this point but may buy shares for RTP for long term investment (>5years). I find advent of eVTOLs super exciting. Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, heck this is my first time writing a DD so what do I even know about investing.

Also, I personally don't think short haul flights will garner a ton of demand until the point the eVTOL rideshare prices match ground based ridesharing and the public acceptance in general increases (Archer's manhattan-JFK pricing of $50 per seat seems a bit too optimistic in next 5 years).

Prices start at $195 per seat (or $95 per seat with the purchase of an annual Airport Pass)1 . BLADE MediMobility – Blade is the largest transporter of human organs in the Northeast United States, reducing the costs and transport time for hospitals versus legacy competitors. This business is a critical part of the Company’s growth strategy as organ movements are expected to be one of the first uses of EVA, before flights for passengers. International Joint Ventures – As part of its expansion strategy, the Company forms joint ventures with local partners in key overseas markets to provide the technology, customer experience, infrastructure design, and employee training, that enables a scalable and consistent Blade experience. Blade’s first international joint venture launched helicopter services late last year in India flying between Mumbai, Pune, and Shirdi. The Company expects to use proceeds from the transaction to fund expansion into new markets, including the Northeast Corridor and West Coast in the United States, as well as target addressable markets internationally (Vancouver, Jakarta and Tokyo). Blade's projected revenue outlook: Blade estimates its revenue in 2021 will reach $52 million. Moreover, by 2023, Blade estimates revenue will reach $181 million and $402 million by the end of 2024. This is all still before significant revenues occur from eVTOL which the company calls Phase 3 starting in 2025 and 2026. It does not assume any passenger eVTOL revenue before then. But in Phase 3, revenue is forecast to skyrocket to $601 million in 2025 and $875 million in 2026. (These numbers should be considered with a grain of salt) Blade's Competitive Moat: BLADE’s first mover advantage, extensive and loyal customer base and control of strategic infrastructure secures its leading position in the future of urban air mobility. #1 market share in key short-distance aviation markets, brings credibility to new market expansion. Strong management team with domain expertise and public market experience. BLADE is already slated to leverage and partner with KSL’s portfolio companies to generate attractive growth opportunities. Proprietary technologies and asset-light model enables flight volume growth and accelerates launch timeline for new markets While Joby Aviation - Uber partnership pose a significant competitive threat, it's worth noting that Uber Elevate failed to take off even with its branding and it'll be challenging for Joby to front the customer acquisition cost (after bleeding dry with production upscaling and certification costs) and outcompete Blade who have an edge in that domain with their ever growing loyal customer base. Another point to note is that Joby will be limited to their own aircrafts while Blade is already scanning potential players and will likely partner with different eVTOL operators depending on the nature of routes. ARKQ is holding 2,748,457 shares, which represents 9.99% of public float for EXPC. Once the merger is complete, there will be a total of 82.5M shares. This means ARK currently own 2.9% of the 82.5M shares. Leadership: Upon completion of the transaction, the combined company will continue to be led by Mr. Wiesenthal as Chief Executive Officer.

SPAC Transaction Summary Blade - EXPC (Investor's presentation) The transaction will be funded by a combination of EIC ($EXPC) cash held in a trust account and proceeds from a $125m PIPE, of which KSL has committed to subscribing for ~$20m PF shares outstanding: 82.5 million Transaction reflects pro forma market capitalization of $1.604 billion (The share price as I'm writing this is $12.9) Transaction will result in $375m of cash to balance sheet to fund growth Transaction implies a fully diluted pro forma equity value of $689.25m for Blade Existing Blade shareholders expected to receive 43.2% of the pro forma equity The boards of directors of both Blade and Experience Investment Corp. have unanimously approved the proposed transaction. The transaction is expected to close in 1H 2021; predictions expect voting to happen in the last week of March/first week of April. Form 8-K Joby - RTP (Investor's presentation) PF shares outstanding: 660 million The pro forma implied market capitalization of the combined company is $6.6 billion, at the $10.00 per share PIPE subscription price and assuming no public shareholders of Reinvent exercise their redemption rights. The Company will receive at the time of transaction close up to $690 million in proceeds from Reinvent’s cash in trust and an $835 million private placement of common stock at a $10.00 per share value and will also convert a $75 million convertible note into common stock at a $10.00 per share value. Pro-forma for the transaction, Joby expects to have up to $1.974Bn of cash to fund growth and commercialize its operations Transaction implies a fully diluted pro-forma aggregate value of $4.6Bn (2.3x AV / 2026E Revenue) Existing Joby shareholders to roll 100% of their equity and expected to receive 76% of the pro-forma equity Up to five-year lock-up on founder shares. Major stockholders and key executives of Joby have agreed to enter into separate lockup agreements as well. Price-based vesting triggers of $12, $18, $24, $32 and $50 per share on founder shares The boards of directors of both Reinvent and Joby have unanimously approved the transaction, which is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2021. Form 8-K What Blade/ EXPC and Joby/ RTP Stocks are Worth Blade - EXPC PF shares outstanding: 82.5 million EXPC SP as of 03/14: $12.9 SPAC Cash = $375MM 82.5MM * $12.9/share = 1.064Bn PF Market Cap PF EV is = $689MM (PF Market Cap - SPAC Cash) Disruptive technology platforms have an average EV-sales ratio of 8.2x. In addition, luxury brands are at 7.5x and recent EV / SPAC mobility deals have averaged 6.5x. The average of all four of these groups of stocks is 7.4x. On page 37 of the presentation, Blade shows the EV-sales ratios of four groups of its peers. Unadjusted: 2024 estimated revenue is expected to be $402MM (Blade isn't accounting any eVTOL revenue, international expansion, operational upside or any strategic upside in this number). This means that the unadjusted EV-sales ratio for 2024 is 1.71x sales. That is very low. This means that at 7.4x $402 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $2.975 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is $3.35 billion. That is 215% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion. Unadjusted fair share price: 3.35Bn/82.5M = $40.61 Adjusted: We need to adjust the 2024 numbers to derive their present value. At a 15% discount rate for 4 years, the 2024 sales are worth 57.175% of this in today’s dollars. The present value sales number is $230 million (i.e., $402 million times 57.175%). As a result, the adjusted EV-sales multiple is 3x (i.e., $689 million EV divided by $230 million). This means that at 7.4x $230 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $1.702 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is $2.077 billion. That is 95.2% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion. Adjusted fair share price: 2.077Bn/82.5M = $25.2 Average between adjusted and unadjusted: Target market value is $2.713 billion. Fair share price: $32.89 Conclusion: EXPC stock is worth at least 154% more than its present price of $12.9 (As of 03/14/2021) This is without accounting all the hype from the merger announcement. Joby - RTP (Speculation) It's difficult to value this stock since all the revenue projections are subject to a lot of variables (Timely certification, customer acquisition, production delays, etc.) Yet, I am long term bullish on this stock. With almost $2 billion in capital on-hand, the Elevate team, and Toyota as a manufacturing partner, Bevirt’s company has everything it needs to achieve his vision of saving a billion people an hour a day. Check Ehang (Chinese competitor) stock's trajectory over past 6 months. Clear that there's a lot of excitement surrounding eVTOLs and the news of merger should send this stock soaring in next few months. ARKX ETF is slated to launch end of this month and RTP is a great match for Cathie Wood's sub-orbital space category. How I am playing EXPC and RTP Catalysts: ARKX ETF launch EOM makes both EXPC and RTP a great spec play EXPC - A lot of spec predictions floating around about the shareholder vote on 3/31 Post NASDAQ sell-off was brutal for all SPACs and especially EXPC and RTP but these stocks are bound to rebound. Positions: 30 calls for 05/21 at $20 strike price, 18 calls for 8/20 at $25 strike price. I am tempted to pick up 04/16 $30 calls tomorrow. I don't have any RTP shares/calls but I might pick up a few calls tomorrow as well. Note that I am only playing catalysts at this point but may buy shares for RTP for long term investment (>5years). I find advent of eVTOLs super exciting. Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, heck this is my first time writing a DD so what do I even know about investing. Do your own DD and most importantly, let me know if I've got any part of the thesis glaringly wrong.

,"Tl;dr: EXPC stock is worth at least 154% more than its present price of $12.9 (As of 03/14/2021). Both EXPC and RTP have significant catalysts lined up ahead that will likely boost the SP from current lows post-NASDAQ sell-off. What to expect Understanding the eVTOL Space Outlook for EXPC and RTP SPAC Transaction Summary What Blade/ EXPC and Joby/ RTP Stocks are Worth How I am playing EXPC and RTP Useful Links Understanding the eVTOL Space (Note: Skip to next section if you feel reading this background info is a drag) Before I even start discussing tickers and plays, I'd first like to shed some light on the groundbreaking Urban Air Mobility (UAM) space, where it's heading and who are the top players vying for the bigger piece of the pie. Understanding the potential investment opportunities without understanding this nascent space is a mooo point. Electric VTOL (Vertical Take off & Landing) air taxis are one of the great emerging technologies of our time, promising to unlock the skies as traffic-free, high-speed, 3D commuting routes. Much quieter and cheaper than helicopter travel, they'll also run on zero-local-emission electric power, and many models suggest they'll cost around the same per mile as a ground-based ride share. Currently there are over 100 players around the globe (check this article to get an overview of some the key players in the eVTOL space) in various stages of designing, building and commercializing eVTOL airframes. As is the case with any disruptive industry, the development and production of eVTOLs is an insanely cash hungry undertaking. Currently, we've a handful of frontrunners around the world who have gone public (Chinese eVTOL $EH) or are ripe to go public soon. Here's a the link to a well rounded DD comparing RTP-ACIC-EXPC-EH-Volo-Lilium that I highly recommend checking out. The United States is acutely aware that it 'missed the boat' on consumer drones, and it's an understandably sore point. But perhaps more importantly the geopolitical consequences of Chinese drone dominance appear to have reverberated around the corridors of the Pentagon for some time. One consequence of this situation is that the latest area of rapid aerospace innovation - eVTOL - has firmly captured the attention of US industry, investors and now the Department of Defense. Leaders of all stripes Stateside are determined that America will indeed be 'first' in this new and exciting area of aerospace innovation. The Air Force recently launched Agility Prime, a non-traditional program seeking to accelerate the commercial market for advanced air mobility vehicles (i.e., ""flying cars""). Check their website here and highly recommend reading this Wired article by USAF's former Acquisition Executive, Will Roper who starts his argument by drawing inspiration from the Jetsons. The outlook for UAM looks positive based on increasing congestion in cities. There are various estimates of the TAM (total addressable market) of UAM. In its presentation, Archer Aviation said that it expects a TAM of $1.5 trillion for UAM, which stretches to $3 trillion in the optimistic scenario. Joby Aviation said that it sees the TAM for UAM at $1 trillion globally and $500 billion in the U.S. Joby Aviation cited the 2018 UAM Market Study from Booz Allen Hamilton for its forecasts. Now, What's stopping us from having eVTOL air taxis today, then? Here are some of the factors you should be considering while evaluating potential investment opportunities: Batteries!! - Battery manufacturers' roadmaps are currently focused on satiating EV manufacturers and developing battery packs with required energy density and specific power (i.e. ability to sustain Tesla's ludicrous mode for a few minutes v/s a few seconds) could take a few years. Alakai Skai's (currently supported by a single private investor) decision however, to ditch lithium batteries for a liquid hydrogen powertrain completely eliminates the battery technology bottleneck that almost every other company is hoping will resolve itself by the time they launch commercial services Certification - These are entirely new categories of aircraft, and the process of certifying, testing and regulating them is going to be monstrously expensive and time consuming. Federal support and urgency to outcompete global players should help the cause. Safety - To coordinate their thrust, each of the electric motor and fan units will need reliable sensors to accurately measure pressure, temperature and other indicators. Each of the motors will induce vibrations in the wings, and their fans may not all spin with the same efficiencies as wear and tear set in. It will be complicated to write software to reliably control all that, says Ella Atkins, an aerospace engineering professor at the University of Michigan. While Atkins says she doesn’t see anything that’s “absolutely a showstopper” with the design, she thinks the many years it took to solve the deadly control problems of the first tiltrotor aircraft, the U.S. military’s V-22 Osprey, offers a sobering parallel for Lilium and other EVTOL developers. “You need a lot of money and time to be successful in aerospace, and the truth is, this industry is trying to go too fast,” says Atkins. Next issue is use of ballistic parachutes. Ballistic parachutes can only save you above a certain altitude, maybe 120 feet or so. Below that, they don't have time to open up, which means that every time you take off or land in one of these machines, you're exposed to a window of time in which total system failure would drop you like a stone. Air Traffic Control - Down the track, there will also have to be a considerable leap forward in air traffic control if the skies are going to safely hold large numbers of these machines zipping about between a bunch of skyports/ vertiports dotted around an urban area. Public Perception - Public perception (trust and safety in tech) is a large obstacle. Safety is the greatest concern with “unruly” passengers, “lasing” of pilots, and aircraft sabotage being main contributors. New importance of travel time, increase in telecommuting, urbanization and de-congestion scenarios could reduce the viability of UAM markets. Advancement in driverless car tech will likely make UAMs suitable for long-distance commute only. All these problems are being worked on, and now we are ready to discuss 2 important SPAC plays that I have rounded up for investment in this space: Joby Aviation - $RTP (eVTOL Manufacturer | Long term play) Blade - $EXPC (eVTOL Asset Light Platform, aka 'Uber of skies'| Short-Mid term play) Outlook for EXPC and RTP Blade - EXPC Investor's presentation Blade is an eVTOL index play, often thought as the ""Uber of skies"" operates by connecting contract pilots with passengers to generate revenue via their proprietary platform. Blade’s business model is proven and is profitable; eVTOL is expected to improve unit economics and dramatically expand the addressable market of BLADE’s existing products. There are currently 167 different eVTOL aircraft under development. Blade is 1 of 1 asset light platform — poised to benefit regardless of which eVTOL manufacturer is first to market. Basically, Blade's strategy is akin to selling shovels in a gold rush. Rob Wiesenthal, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Blade, commented, “Ground mobility has been radically transformed by software and battery technology, as evidenced by the rapid adoption of electric vehicles. The next battle is in the air. This transaction provides the capital for Blade to profitably expand its urban air mobility business using conventional rotorcraft today, while providing a seamless transition to EVA aircraft tomorrow.” Blade and KSL have already identified around $300 million in short- to mid-term investment opportunities that will help Blade expand its presence in the northeastern United States, on the West Coast in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and in new markets that could include Vancouver, Jakarta, and Tokyo. (EXPC is sponsored by an affiliate of KSL Capital Partners, making the EXPC<>Blade strategic merger even more prudent). Blade operates in four key lines of business: Short Distance – Flights between 60 and 100 miles in distance, primarily servicing commuters for prices between $595 and $795 per seat (or $295 for monthly commuter pass holders). BLADE Airport – Flights between all New York area airports and dedicated Blade lounges in Manhattan’s heliports.

International Joint Ventures – As part of its expansion strategy, the Company forms joint ventures with local partners in key overseas markets to provide the technology, customer experience, infrastructure design, and employee training, that enables a scalable and consistent Blade experience. Blade’s first international joint venture launched helicopter services late last year in India flying between Mumbai, Pune, and Shirdi. The Company expects to use proceeds from the transaction to fund expansion into new markets, including the Northeast Corridor and West Coast in the United States, as well as target addressable markets internationally (Vancouver, Jakarta and Tokyo). Blade's projected revenue outlook: Blade estimates its revenue in 2021 will reach $52 million. Moreover, by 2023, Blade estimates revenue will reach $181 million and $402 million by the end of 2024. This is all still before significant revenues occur from eVTOL which the company calls Phase 3 starting in 2025 and 2026. It does not assume any passenger eVTOL revenue before then. But in Phase 3, revenue is forecast to skyrocket to $601 million in 2025 and $875 million in 2026.

Form 8-K Joby - RTP (Investor's presentation) PF shares outstanding: 660 million The pro forma implied market capitalization of the combined company is $6.6 billion, at the $10.00 per share PIPE subscription price and assuming no public shareholders of Reinvent exercise their redemption rights. The Company will receive at the time of transaction close up to $690 million in proceeds from Reinvent’s cash in trust and an $835 million private placement of common stock at a $10.00 per share value and will also convert a $75 million convertible note into common stock at a $10.00 per share value. Pro-forma for the transaction, Joby expects to have up to $1.974Bn of cash to fund growth and commercialize its operations Transaction implies a fully diluted pro-forma aggregate value of $4.6Bn (2.3x AV / 2026E Revenue) Existing Joby shareholders to roll 100% of their equity and expected to receive 76% of the pro-forma equity Up to five-year lock-up on founder shares. Major stockholders and key executives of Joby have agreed to enter into separate lockup agreements as well. Price-based vesting triggers of $12, $18, $24, $32 and $50 per share on founder shares The boards of directors of both Reinvent and Joby have unanimously approved the transaction, which is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2021. Form 8-K What Blade/ EXPC and Joby/ RTP Stocks are Worth Blade - EXPC PF shares outstanding: 82.5 million EXPC SP as of 03/14: $12.9 SPAC Cash = $375MM 82.5MM * $12.9/share = 1.064Bn PF Market Cap PF EV is = $689MM (PF Market Cap - SPAC Cash) Disruptive technology platforms have an average EV-sales ratio of 8.2x. In addition, luxury brands are at 7.5x and recent EV / SPAC mobility deals have averaged 6.5x. The average of all four of these groups of stocks is 7.4x. On page 37 of the presentation, Blade shows the EV-sales ratios of four groups of its peers. Unadjusted: 2024 estimated revenue is expected to be $402MM (Blade isn't accounting any eVTOL revenue, international expansion, operational upside or any strategic upside in this number). This means that the unadjusted EV-sales ratio for 2024 is 1.71x sales. That is very low. This means that at 7.4x $402 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $2.975 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is $3.35 billion. That is 215% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion. Unadjusted fair share price: 3.35Bn/82.5M = $40.61 Adjusted: We need to adjust the 2024 numbers to derive their present value. At a 15% discount rate for 4 years, the 2024 sales are worth 57.175% of this in today’s dollars. The present value sales number is $230 million (i.e., $402 million times 57.175%). As a result, the adjusted EV-sales multiple is 3x (i.e., $689 million EV divided by $230 million). This means that at 7.4x $230 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $1.702 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is $2.077 billion. That is 95.2% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion. Adjusted fair share price: 2.077Bn/82.5M = $25.2 Average between adjusted and unadjusted: Target market value is $2.713 billion. Fair share price: $32.89 Conclusion: EXPC stock is worth at least 154% more than its present price of $12.9 (As of 03/14/2021) This is without accounting all the hype from the merger announcement. Joby - RTP (Speculation) It's difficult to value this stock since all the revenue projections are subject to a lot of variables (Timely certification, customer acquisition, production delays, etc.) Yet, I am long term bullish on this stock. With almost $2 billion in capital on-hand, the Elevate team, and Toyota as a manufacturing partner, Bevirt’s company has everything it needs to achieve his vision of saving a billion people an hour a day. Check Ehang (Chinese competitor) stock's trajectory over past 6 months. Clear that there's a lot of excitement surrounding eVTOLs and the news of merger should send this stock soaring in next few months. ARKX ETF is slated to launch end of this month and RTP is a great match for Cathie Wood's sub-orbital space category. How I am playing EXPC and RTP Catalysts: ARKX ETF launch EOM makes both EXPC and RTP a great spec play EXPC - A lot of spec predictions floating around about the shareholder vote on 3/31 Post NASDAQ sell-off was brutal for all SPACs and especially EXPC and RTP but these stocks are bound to rebound. Positions: 30 calls for 05/21 at $20 strike price, 18 calls for 8/20 at $25 strike price. I am tempted to pick up 04/16 $30 calls tomorrow. I don't have any RTP shares/calls but I might pick up a few calls tomorrow as well. Note that I am only playing catalysts at this point but may buy shares for RTP for long term investment (>5years). I find advent of eVTOLs super exciting. Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, heck this is my first time writing a DD so what do I even know about investing.

,"Tl;dr: EXPC stock is worth at least 154% more than its present price of $12.9 (As of 03/14/2021). Both EXPC and RTP have significant catalysts lined up ahead that will likely boost the SP from current lows post-NASDAQ sell-off. What to expect Understanding the eVTOL Space Outlook for EXPC and RTP SPAC Transaction Summary What Blade/ EXPC and Joby/ RTP Stocks are Worth How I am playing EXPC and RTP Useful Links Understanding the eVTOL Space (Note: Skip to next section if you feel reading this background info is a drag) Before I even start discussing tickers and plays, I'd first like to shed some light on the groundbreaking Urban Air Mobility (UAM) space, where it's heading and who are the top players vying for the bigger piece of the pie. Understanding the potential investment opportunities without understanding this nascent space is a mooo point. Electric VTOL (Vertical Take off & Landing) air taxis are one of the great emerging technologies of our time, promising to unlock the skies as traffic-free, high-speed, 3D commuting routes. Much quieter and cheaper than helicopter travel, they'll also run on zero-local-emission electric power, and many models suggest they'll cost around the same per mile as a ground-based ride share. Currently there are over 100 players around the globe (check this article to get an overview of some the key players in the eVTOL space) in various stages of designing, building and commercializing eVTOL airframes. As is the case with any disruptive industry, the development and production of eVTOLs is an insanely cash hungry undertaking. Currently, we've a handful of frontrunners around the world who have gone public (Chinese eVTOL $EH) or are ripe to go public soon. Here's a the link to a well rounded DD comparing RTP-ACIC-EXPC-EH-Volo-Lilium that I highly recommend checking out. The United States is acutely aware that it 'missed the boat' on consumer drones, and it's an understandably sore point. But perhaps more importantly the geopolitical consequences of Chinese drone dominance appear to have reverberated around the corridors of the Pentagon for some time. One consequence of this situation is that the latest area of rapid aerospace innovation - eVTOL - has firmly captured the attention of US industry, investors and now the Department of Defense. Leaders of all stripes Stateside are determined that America will indeed be 'first' in this new and exciting area of aerospace innovation. The Air Force recently launched Agility Prime, a non-traditional program seeking to accelerate the commercial market for advanced air mobility vehicles (i.e., ""flying cars""). Check their website here and highly recommend reading this Wired article by USAF's former Acquisition Executive, Will Roper who starts his argument by drawing inspiration from the Jetsons. The outlook for UAM looks positive based on increasing congestion in cities. There are various estimates of the TAM (total addressable market) of UAM. In its presentation, Archer Aviation said that it expects a TAM of $1.5 trillion for UAM, which stretches to $3 trillion in the optimistic scenario. Joby Aviation said that it sees the TAM for UAM at $1 trillion globally and $500 billion in the U.S. Joby Aviation cited the 2018 UAM Market Study from Booz Allen Hamilton for its forecasts. Now, What's stopping us from having eVTOL air taxis today, then? Here are some of the factors you should be considering while evaluating potential investment opportunities: Batteries!! - Battery manufacturers' roadmaps are currently focused on satiating EV manufacturers and developing battery packs with required energy density and specific power (i.e. ability to sustain Tesla's ludicrous mode for a few minutes v/s a few seconds) could take a few years. Alakai Skai's (currently supported by a single private investor) decision however, to ditch lithium batteries for a liquid hydrogen powertrain completely eliminates the battery technology bottleneck that almost every other company is hoping will resolve itself by the time they launch commercial services Certification - These are entirely new categories of aircraft, and the process of certifying, testing and regulating them is going to be monstrously expensive and time consuming. Federal support and urgency to outcompete global players should help the cause. Safety - To coordinate their thrust, each of the electric motor and fan units will need reliable sensors to accurately measure pressure, temperature and other indicators. Each of the motors will induce vibrations in the wings, and their fans may not all spin with the same efficiencies as wear and tear set in. It will be complicated to write software to reliably control all that, says Ella Atkins, an aerospace engineering professor at the University of Michigan. While Atkins says she doesn’t see anything that’s “absolutely a showstopper” with the design, she thinks the many years it took to solve the deadly control problems of the first tiltrotor aircraft, the U.S. military’s V-22 Osprey, offers a sobering parallel for Lilium and other EVTOL developers. “You need a lot of money and time to be successful in aerospace, and the truth is, this industry is trying to go too fast,” says Atkins. Next issue is use of ballistic parachutes. Ballistic parachutes can only save you above a certain altitude, maybe 120 feet or so. Below that, they don't have time to open up, which means that every time you take off or land in one of these machines, you're exposed to a window of time in which total system failure would drop you like a stone. Air Traffic Control - Down the track, there will also have to be a considerable leap forward in air traffic control if the skies are going to safely hold large numbers of these machines zipping about between a bunch of skyports/ vertiports dotted around an urban area. Public Perception - Public perception (trust and safety in tech) is a large obstacle. Safety is the greatest concern with “unruly” passengers, “lasing” of pilots, and aircraft sabotage being main contributors. New importance of travel time, increase in telecommuting, urbanization and de-congestion scenarios could reduce the viability of UAM markets. Advancement in driverless car tech will likely make UAMs suitable for long-distance commute only. All these problems are being worked on, and now we are ready to discuss 2 important SPAC plays that I have rounded up for investment in this space: Joby Aviation - $RTP (eVTOL Manufacturer | Long term play) Blade - $EXPC (eVTOL Asset Light Platform, aka 'Uber of skies'| Short-Mid term play) Outlook for EXPC and RTP Blade - EXPC Investor's presentation Blade is an eVTOL index play, often thought as the ""Uber of skies"" operates by connecting contract pilots with passengers to generate revenue via their proprietary platform. Blade’s business model is proven and is profitable; eVTOL is expected to improve unit economics and dramatically expand the addressable market of BLADE’s existing products. There are currently 167 different eVTOL aircraft under development. Blade is 1 of 1 asset light platform — poised to benefit regardless of which eVTOL manufacturer is first to market. Basically, Blade's strategy is akin to selling shovels in a gold rush. Rob Wiesenthal, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Blade, commented, “Ground mobility has been radically transformed by software and battery technology, as evidenced by the rapid adoption of electric vehicles. The next battle is in the air. This transaction provides the capital for Blade to profitably expand its urban air mobility business using conventional rotorcraft today, while providing a seamless transition to EVA aircraft tomorrow.” Blade and KSL have already identified around $300 million in short- to mid-term investment opportunities that will help Blade expand its presence in the northeastern United States, on the West Coast in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and in new markets that could include Vancouver, Jakarta, and Tokyo. (EXPC is sponsored by an affiliate of KSL Capital Partners, making the EXPC<>Blade strategic merger even more prudent). Blade operates in four key lines of business: Short Distance – Flights between 60 and 100 miles in distance, primarily servicing commuters for prices between $595 and $795 per seat (or $295 for monthly commuter pass holders). BLADE Airport – Flights between all New York area airports and dedicated Blade lounges in Manhattan’s heliports. Prices start at $195 per seat (or $95 per seat with the purchase of an annual Airport Pass)1 . BLADE MediMobility – Blade is the largest transporter of human organs in the Northeast United States, reducing the costs and transport time for hospitals versus legacy competitors. This business is a critical part of the Company’s growth strategy as organ movements are expected to be one of the first uses of EVA, before flights for passengers. International Joint Ventures – As part of its expansion strategy, the Company forms joint ventures with local partners in key overseas markets to provide the technology, customer experience, infrastructure design, and employee training, that enables a scalable and consistent Blade experience. Blade’s first international joint venture launched helicopter services late last year in India flying between Mumbai, Pune, and Shirdi. The Company expects to use proceeds from the transaction to fund expansion into new markets, including the Northeast Corridor and West Coast in the United States, as well as target addressable markets internationally (Vancouver, Jakarta and Tokyo). Blade's projected revenue outlook: Blade estimates its revenue in 2021 will reach $52 million. Moreover, by 2023, Blade estimates revenue will reach $181 million and $402 million by the end of 2024. This is all still before significant revenues occur from eVTOL which the company calls Phase 3 starting in 2025 and 2026. It does not assume any passenger eVTOL revenue before then. But in Phase 3, revenue is forecast to skyrocket to $601 million in 2025 and $875 million in 2026. (These numbers should be considered with a grain of salt) Blade's Competitive Moat: BLADE’s first mover advantage, extensive and loyal customer base and control of strategic infrastructure secures its leading position in the future of urban air mobility. #1 market share in key short-distance aviation markets, brings credibility to new market expansion. Strong management team with domain expertise and public market experience. BLADE is already slated to leverage and partner with KSL’s portfolio companies to generate attractive growth opportunities. Proprietary technologies and asset-light model enables flight volume growth and accelerates launch timeline for new markets While Joby Aviation - Uber partnership pose a significant competitive threat, it's worth noting that Uber Elevate failed to take off even with its branding and it'll be challenging for Joby to front the customer acquisition cost (after bleeding dry with production upscaling and certification costs) and outcompete Blade who have an edge in that domain with their ever growing loyal customer base. Another point to note is that Joby will be limited to their own aircrafts while Blade is already scanning potential players and will likely partner with different eVTOL operators depending on the nature of routes. ARKQ is holding 2,748,457 shares, which represents 9.99% of public float for EXPC. Once the merger is complete, there will be a total of 82.5M shares. This means ARK currently own 2.9% of the 82.5M shares. Leadership: Upon completion of the transaction, the combined company will continue to be led by Mr. Wiesenthal as Chief Executive Officer. The senior management team will also include Will Heyburn, Chief Financial Officer and Head of Corporate Development, Brandon Keene, Chief Technology Officer, and Melissa Tomkiel, General Counsel.
