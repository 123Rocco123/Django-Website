Per ""Cunningham's Law"", I'll write them down and see what kind of attention they attract...If you're charitably donating cash, there's minimal advantage to a DAF.If you've got the cash, donate it directly -- there's no need to involve a middleman.Use a DAF if you want to ""pre-donate"" a chunk of change, but want the DAF to spread out delivery over several years, perhaps past your own lifetime.If you're donating appreciated assets (stocks, funds), a DAF may still be ""unnecessary"". The pitch here is that you paid $1000 for something, it's now worth $2000, but the second $1000 is unrealized cap gains, which will be taxable to you -- although that tax rate may still be zero depending on your specific circumstances.Brokerage-sponsored DAFs can receive appreciated stock, sell it themselves (in which case -they- pay the cap gains at -their- rate, likely less), and distribute the equivalent cash. You save what you would have paid in taxes yourself.BUT, it's not always necessary to go through a DAF to achieve this; even my own medium-sized congregation can handle this case without the DAF middleman.So, the one case where a DAF seems ""necessary"" becomes • you want to donate appreciated stock with unrealized gains, • your cap gains tax rate is outside of the zero bracket, AND • your donee has no mechanism to receive the appreciated stock and liquidate it themselves.I think that covers it. So far, I have no plans to use one myself. When I get to RMD age, I'll think about it again -- but even then, I have the option of making a ""Qualified Charitable Contribution"", which means it doesn't even -hit- my AGI for the year.",4,0.527,NEGATIVE,1.0

My take-away is this:For the contributor, a DAF is generally advantageous to high wealth individuals who want to reduce their tax burden.For the recipient, a DAF takes an immediate contribution and turns it into an annuity of sorts. It allows the recipient to make the contribution ""sticky"", especially given the attractive position of DAFs to high net worth individuals.For DAF owners, it is simply a way to make money by keeping more money ""under management"".Ergo, the LDS church has a DAF to enable high-wealth individuals (mostly members of the church?) to use a tax-avoidance vehicle that both generates revenue for the church through management fees and, in the case of these specific DAFs, the requirement to contribute at least 40% of the disbursements to LDS-owned charitable organizations.How'd I do?",5,0.519,NEGATIVE,0.871

Then, it works like any other investment portfolio. It can gain or lose value. So ideally, you make an initial contribution and then the value of your DAF could increase over time- you can contribute appreciated assets to avoid capital gains tax on investments- under certain circumstances, you can contribute things like property, art, etc. (depending on the DAF)- they offer alternative investment options to those with HNW (high new worth) (depending on the DAF)Drawbacks?:- There are usually fees associated with having the account, and which vary according to the DAF. There are some with no fees, it really depends- Some require an initial minimum contribution, which can be as high as $500,000. But others require $0, so again it depends- Once you make a contribution, since you get a tax benefit right away, the funds are irrevocable. You can't get them back, they are owned by the DAF. BUT, you are a grant advisor, and can recommend where the money goes. And they are very accommodating and respectful to these requestsDAFs get a lot of bad press:- They tend to have high AUM (assets under management.) Donors will make more contributions than grants. More money going in than coming out. The DAF community is working on this, I don't think they want it to be like this.- They are also seen as only being valuable to those with HNW or UHNW (high net worth, ultra high net worth.) ""DAFs are only for rich people who want tax breaks."" True, but not necessarily true. DAFs are a tool, and rich people know how to use the tool to their advantage.- DAFs are seen as a middle man. ""Why not just donate directly to the charity?"" ""Will my funds be used how I want them to be used?""DAFs are nothing more than a PLATFORM, a vehicle for charitable giving. I personally think they are a great way to make the most out of your Charitable giving. You are able to contribute, invest, and grant all in one place.
