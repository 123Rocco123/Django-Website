,"I'm looking to buy a home that I will stay in for 7 years. I have a 200k stock portfolio and the home costs 100k. To reduce on mortgage fees and interest, I've found that Interactive Brokers will give me a variable loan of 100k @ 3.2% (https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=1595) Seems like it's cheaper than an ARM loan which is ~4.2% and gives me the flexibility of any cash buyer in the real estate market. Does this leverage make sense?","The fun thing about IB and why that rate is so low is that if you fail to meet your margin requirements, they don't even warn you to add more cash before liquidating assets. Read the fine print!If you max out your margin and your portfolio dips a small bit, IB could liquidate it.",0,0.508,POSITIVE,0.573

They might even be pretty affordable if buy buy deep OTM puts. I wonder what impact they would have on your ""interest rate"" if add in the cost of put protection, which, incidentally would make the whole thing a more realistic comparison to a real loan which doesn't have this liquidation risk.",2,0.532,NEGATIVE,0.98
