,"I was studying technical analisys and while going trough some indicators I discovered the Arms Race index, seems like a very good one for general market sentiment. What other indicators do you know or use that could be useful?","MACD, Dynamic Momentum Index, RSI, 200, 50, 20 EMA, Bollinger Bands, Projection Bands, & Pivot Points.Each one of these serves their own purposes, some I like to use in conjunction with others. I like to pair the Dynamic Momentum Index with RSI, they can tell you when prices may be set for a rebound. Bollinger Bands & Projection Bands gives you a general idea of where prices might be trading at. Pivot points help identify trending support & resistance levels per day. MACD can help you identify reversals.",0,0.512,POSITIVE,0.997

,"I was studying technical analisys and while going trough some indicators I discovered the Arms Race index, seems like a very good one for general market sentiment. What other indicators do you know or use that could be useful?","Agreed. I used to come home from work and stay awake all night reading research papers written by PhDs, from fundamental and technical analysis to artificial intelligence. I spent months implementing them into countless computer programs and simulations. It was a nut I never cracked. It would have been more productive focusing all that energy on increasing my income to put more towards a buy-and-hold strategy.Simple 200dma SPY beating the market with lower volatility.Also, one thing to note, is the tax implications of more active strategies. You will be paying taxes on your gains every year. With a passive strategy, those gains could compound over decades before there is a tax consequence. In the example linked above there are 40 timing periods, each with tax implications. Whereas with buy and hold there would be none.",1,0.532,NEGATIVE,0.999
