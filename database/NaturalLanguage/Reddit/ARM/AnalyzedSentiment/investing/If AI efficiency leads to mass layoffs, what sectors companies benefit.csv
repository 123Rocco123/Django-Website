,"There is plenty of advice out there on riding the AI wave (NVIDIA, ARM, SMCP) but what if AI efficiencies lead to increased unemployment like some folks are predicting? What companies/sectors benefit from people working less and less people working? More folks doing gig work trying to survive maybe more free time but with less disposable income Maybe more people going back to school?","It would be the sectors that are laying off all the people -- because those sectors are theoretically becoming more efficient. I'd imagine it's industries with a large number of relatively-low-skilled knowledge workers. Companies with large remote customer service and sales forces, for example.While those companies will benefit somewhat, I'm not sure the efficiency they achieve will cause more than a bubble in their performance. For example, if an airlines can AI-ify 90% of its call centers, how much of the total operational cost will it save? 5-10%?It will create a wind at some business's backs -- and when mechanical functions (driving, order fulfillment, manufacturing) get replaced, there will be bigger waves. In the short term, I'm thinking a lot of businesses just get a little more efficient, which is probably good for the market as a whole as long as layoffs don't drag down the economy, real wages, etc..",0,0.547,NEGATIVE,0.999

It may be easier to think of the sectors that will not benefit as much.A company whose primary expense is labor, real laborious labor, probably will not benefit as much.

If the money maker is not using it, the governments would have more possibility to print without causing inflation.

I also believe it would increase birth rates so anything related to that would be also positively affected.I think rare earth mining, refining and recycling will grow a lot. I also think that the companies that is currently doing very well with AI, will keep doing well with AI. I only doubt if Nvidia can keep its current success.
