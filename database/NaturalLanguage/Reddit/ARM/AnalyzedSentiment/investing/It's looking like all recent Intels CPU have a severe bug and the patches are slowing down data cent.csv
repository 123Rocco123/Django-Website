Off the top of my head that could message passing and async i/o heavy programs. Pre-Sandy Bridge processors are going to take a bigger hit since they lack PCID functionality as well.I'm not sure regarding Redis and PostgresSQL specifically but another area that could be seeing a big hit is lazy memory allocation too and that might be something that could be patched in the kernel or the applications themselves. This is still a newly publicized bug that came to light during a major holiday period and things are pretty far off from a fully optimized software solution. This is all triage right now.I don't know what other options there are patch wise. Best case scenario Intel would either have an unlisted behavior specific MSR that could be changed via the firmware at boot time but it seems like this has been known about and held close for at least a month and a half without major vendors pushing new bios to fix it so that seems unlikely.This should be something that's pretty easy to fix in new silicon though and Intel likely has the financial resources and contracts to help weather this pretty well but it's undoubtedly going to cost them.,5,0.528,NEGATIVE,1.0

The only overhead that the fix introduces is at the kernel to user boundary not direct I/O throughput, which is pretty much all DMA these days anyways.It's possible to simply do fewer reads and writes by using larger userspace buffers or simply memory mapping files to user space in the first place for example. It's also possible that this is already being done but that current implementations are using 'lazy' style evaluation to actually pull pages into user space on demand which incurs similar overhead for each page load since the page fault handler also does a user -> kernel -> user transition.Ultimately there's likely workarounds for this but they're going to take time to implement and many will occur outside of the kernel. Again this is a huge pain the ass for developers impacted by these changes but necessarily insurmountable problems in many cases.The reason games and other resource heavy applications are minimally impacted is because they're already high optimized to do I/O and self manage memory without invoking the kernel much. As u/dragontamer5788 mentioned they also rely heavily on user space hardware access where appropriate. Games in particular have relied on direct GPU and sound card access for ages, that's actually where the whole DirectX naming convention came from. If you're actually doing extremely high throughput networking stuff you're going to be accessing things directly and flat out polling the hardware instead of dealing with interrupts too. Solutions exist for most of these problems they just weren't used outside of gaming and HPC environments because syscall latency wasn't previously a problem for anyone else.",6,0.513,NEGATIVE,1.0

,"I'm relating to this article. The essence of the message is, that data centers have to pay for the same amount of power and delivering 30% less CPU capacity. Consequences: AMD's Epyc CPU will sell like hot dogs. But has AMD the production capacity? Intel will have a problem to defend all the lawsuits Because the problem can't be corrected via microcode patch, the necessary changes for the CPU are huge. It will take a huge amount of time and the results for performance are uncertain. Update: It turns out there is an early benchmark from a reputable source In my opinion data centers will look for diversification. ARM-CPUs are candidates. At least AMD wil have a boost for the next year.","this. also security bugs have a tendency of becoming worse in terms of impact, rather than better, once more fully understood. this one has serious legs in terms of impact within cloud/virtualised environments, there's going to be a hell of a lot of infosec team cycles within large corporates spent on understanding and mitigating the impact of this to their business.edit: possibly good for INTC in the short term as a quick solution will be to buy more processing power to compensate. mid-long term its going to cost intel, pure speculation but it might actually be significant enough that cloud providers end up claiming on their cyber insurance policies and the underwriters go after Intel via subrogation rights... pure conjecture on my part.",5,0.531,NEGATIVE,1.0

Sure this seems like a huge bug and it will effect a LOT of systems world wide, but on the other hand these are systems that have already been sold, and I'm assuming Intel is work like crazy to fix this for their next chip design and it will not be an issue with their upcoming processors.So how will this really hurt Intel? Damage to the brand that will effect future sales regardless of their new chips not having this issue? Class action law suits? Or is this just a good buying opportunity and this will just blow over and not have a huge impact on their business as a whole. Could this even be a blessing in design given the fact that a lot of businesses and people may be looking to replace their processors/systems as a result of this issue?",0,0.54,NEGATIVE,1.0
