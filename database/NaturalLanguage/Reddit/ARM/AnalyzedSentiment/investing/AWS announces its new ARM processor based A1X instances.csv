An instance is basically the spec configuration that you choose. There are several types of instances from computation optimized to memory optimized to storage and gpu optimized. The new A instances fall under general computing, basically the cheapest instance type you can get. The cheapest of the General computering instance types is the t3 nano which costs $0.005 per hour. The new arm A instances start at $0.0255 per hour. Both fall under free tier meaning that you can use them for upto a year for free",1,0.532,POSITIVE,0.941
