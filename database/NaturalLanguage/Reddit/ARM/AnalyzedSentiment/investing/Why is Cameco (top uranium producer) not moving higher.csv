,"It's my understanding that one of the biggest threats to this Uranium miner is nuclear deproliferation. When nukes are decommissioned the fissile material is sold to power plants, displacing mined uranium and driving prices down. Currently this accounts for 13-19% of reactor fuel. Given Trumps tweet about re escalating the arms race I would have expected the price of Cameco, the world's top uranium producer, to have risen. Indeed there was a small bump yesterday, but it looks like the rally fizzled out. I'm wondering if my assumptions about nuclear proliferation and the price of uranium are wrong or the markets stopped caring about the president elect's tweets. Every once and a while I consider buying Cameco as a contrarian play and if you look at their stock it does seem to perform better under Republican administrations, but I would like to understand more about the dynamics of Uranium pricing before I take the risk.","You argue that deproliferation is a threat, but I'm asking very seriously: is it? Do you not think that the energy sector is a significantly larger customer than defence, by now?Secondly, there's the question of whether ""re-escalating the arms race"" actually leads to more nuclear weapons being produced or just putting more on standby. Both the US and Russia already have an absurd number of these weapons, so I think there's an argument that any sort of arms race would take place with the development of other weapons or more efficient missiles (rather than new warheads).Also it's Ukraine, there's some pretty significant country risk there.Just food for thought, I'm not super familiar with uranium either, hopefully it spurns some discussion.",0,0.536,NEGATIVE,0.986

When nukes are decommissioned the warheads are repurposed as reactor fuel. That creates a surplus which pushes prices down.Deproliferation doesn't decrease demand, it increases supply.",1,0.512,NEGATIVE,0.986

I see your rationale now. All else equal, that seems reasonable.This may be a good investment thesis, although the markets are fickle and it's hard to tell if Trump will actually carry through on his tweets. Furthermore, although some energy companies buy decommissioned warheads, this particular mine's clients may not be. There may be some sort of market segmentation that isn't visible at the moment.",2,0.53,NEGATIVE,1.0

Only after the info has been reflected in the price of uranium consistently would I expect CCJ to start rising significantly.I should buy some more CCJ...",0,0.518,NEGATIVE,0.925

Unfortunately democracies don't always make logical decisions. Germany gave up nuclear for solar after Fukushima despite having few coastal plants, little seismic activity, and not much sun. So far that decision has worked out for them.In my opinion the most logical argument against nuclear is that it enables proliferation. Unfortunately proliferation seems more likely now than at any point in the last 30 years. Ukraine and Iraq gave up their nuclear programs and were invaded. North Korea now has nukes and as a result the regime will remain in power. If the Iran deal falls apart they will develop nukes and Israel will increase their arsenal. India has a nationalist hawk who could build up their arsenal and Pakistan would follow suit. I think the Japanese will keep their plants open in case relations with China break down and they need to build bombs.I'll have to do more research into where these countries source their Uranium from, but I imagine those that are aligned with the US (India, Japan, Europe) source it from Cameco and the others do not.",1,0.519,POSITIVE,0.951
