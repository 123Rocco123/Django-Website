,"ETA: Please read title as ""... index ETFS..."". ETFs are generally good for diversification; index ETFs are simply weak in a sideways market, where dividend-yielding assets can shine. TL;DR Although they're thus far a safe investment strategy for the long term, index ETFs perform poorly during a downturn because they unavoidably capture an entire dip and don't recover fully until the index does Better efficiency toward an investment goal can be achieved by picking winning stocks, especially during a downturn During a sideways, volatile market, purchasing safe, share-price-depressed dividend stocks can allow excellent growth (especially with DRIP) There are safer dividend stocks today that also offer tremendous price upside (equal to or greater than index ETFs), making them an excellent bet right now This requires a shift away from an index-ETF-only mindset To recap, ETFs have these characteristics: Lower fees than actively managed funds Historically higher performance than many actively managed mutual funds Poor performance during downturns ETFs are an easy way to diversify. But it's incredibly easy to beat them, especially now. For someone who actively invests, ETFs are a subpar investing strategy presently especially since we are likely in for an extended stretch of market volatility.

For those new to REITs and BDCs, here are some brief tips: Defensive REITs available include healthcare, government and others. Debt ratio for an REIT or BDC can look different because of how they're required to operate; read up and don't be afraid, just arm yourself with knowledge about each company you buy. REITs which feature ""triple-net"" leases (ones where the tenant pays for taxes, insurance and maintenance) are lower-risk in general, and tend to be very well-positioned to survive the downturn due to longer lease periods. Avoid mREITs for now unless you really know what you're doing. Again, stay away from REIT ETFs. Not only do they tend to feature low yields, their diversification patterns may entail extra risks in the current economy, plus there's no reason to suffer any extra fees. Consider enrolling in DRIP (dividend reinvestment plan), especially if trading in an IRA without tax implications; if taxes are a worry, reinvest manually with after-tax dividend earnings, allowing balancing as you go The longer a horizontal market persists, the more a high-dividend strategy will pull away long-term. For those unfamiliar with the concept, run numbers through a dividend-yield calculator and be astonished at what you can accomplish starting with 12-18% yields right now.

,"ETA: Please read title as ""... index ETFS..."". ETFs are generally good for diversification; index ETFs are simply weak in a sideways market, where dividend-yielding assets can shine. TL;DR Although they're thus far a safe investment strategy for the long term, index ETFs perform poorly during a downturn because they unavoidably capture an entire dip and don't recover fully until the index does Better efficiency toward an investment goal can be achieved by picking winning stocks, especially during a downturn During a sideways, volatile market, purchasing safe, share-price-depressed dividend stocks can allow excellent growth (especially with DRIP) There are safer dividend stocks today that also offer tremendous price upside (equal to or greater than index ETFs), making them an excellent bet right now This requires a shift away from an index-ETF-only mindset To recap, ETFs have these characteristics: Lower fees than actively managed funds Historically higher performance than many actively managed mutual funds Poor performance during downturns ETFs are an easy way to diversify. But it's incredibly easy to beat them, especially now. For someone who actively invests, ETFs are a subpar investing strategy presently especially since we are likely in for an extended stretch of market volatility. Instead, pick solid high-dividend stocks in defensive sectors like healthcare. Pick companies with strong balance sheets, earnings and growth, positioned to survive the downturn. For those new to REITs and BDCs, here are some brief tips: Defensive REITs available include healthcare, government and others. Debt ratio for an REIT or BDC can look different because of how they're required to operate; read up and don't be afraid, just arm yourself with knowledge about each company you buy. REITs which feature ""triple-net"" leases (ones where the tenant pays for taxes, insurance and maintenance) are lower-risk in general, and tend to be very well-positioned to survive the downturn due to longer lease periods. Avoid mREITs for now unless you really know what you're doing. Again, stay away from REIT ETFs. Not only do they tend to feature low yields, their diversification patterns may entail extra risks in the current economy, plus there's no reason to suffer any extra fees. Consider enrolling in DRIP (dividend reinvestment plan), especially if trading in an IRA without tax implications; if taxes are a worry, reinvest manually with after-tax dividend earnings, allowing balancing as you go The longer a horizontal market persists, the more a high-dividend strategy will pull away long-term. For those unfamiliar with the concept, run numbers through a dividend-yield calculator and be astonished at what you can accomplish starting with 12-18% yields right now. Price-depressed dividend-paying stocks are like a fast-growing field of tulips. Buying blue-chip stocks with hardly any price upside is foolish in this market--but buying ETFs is a conscious decision to avoid higher returns.","You know stock prices drop by the dividend amount on the ex dividend date right.I would say tech dividend stocks are the best, although healthcare like JNJ are fine.",0,0.54,POSITIVE,0.608

My logic is that placing a couple LEAPS around the current price will do me good in 9 months or longer. Of course some will go bust but the ones that do hit will pay massively.

I've diversified a bit into foreign companies with stocks like LNVGY, NYSE:PKX, etc. because of the special risks to the U.S. economy, though those are lower-yield (though still greatly enhanced by the downturn). Healthcare is another area, largely within REITs, and so is government. With the oil downturn and recent pricing, I've picked up some renewable energy (NASDAQ:AY, NYSE:NEP) despite single-digit yields, due to excellent rebound and long-term growth potential as energy shifts increasingly away from oil with the move to electric cars.",1,0.518,POSITIVE,0.999
