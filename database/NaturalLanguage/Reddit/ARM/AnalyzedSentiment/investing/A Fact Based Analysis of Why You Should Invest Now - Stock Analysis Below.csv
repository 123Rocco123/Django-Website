,"I started investing March 7th of last year and its been the one year mark and I am currently a touch under -3%, from a ATH in my portfolio of 22%. Some of my stocks such as Uber and Lyft have dropped more precipitously. I'm positively giddy, to be frank, at this point in time and I am actively hoping it keeps going lower (Though I don't like the notion of people's principals being wiped out, or people getting sick because of the coronavirus because as a controlled asthmatic this isn't the type of disease I want fucking around the world). I'm sure a lot of you are sick of hearing about this, and to the people panicking its because its scant on principals that can ground us. Saying a euphemism or empty sayings isn't going to help people in a state of panic, logic is. What keeps me grounded? The amount of bargains and steals on the market. If you're a bull, this will be helpful for you as well, but these stock analysis's are meant to calm the minds of people who are debating whether to sell their securities or keep them. Healthcare Stocks: CVS - Strong Buy CVS's acquisition of AETNA was viewed as a colossally risky gamble, or a stroke of genius last year. From a high of over 100$ to 52$, CVS needed to do something to shake things up and to their credit management has. The acquisition of Aetna, CVS's position as a Pharmacy Benefits Manager, and their retooling of their stores to sell more medically oriented merchandise such as vitamins as well as their reorientation to service people with chronic illnesses with their HEALTHHUB initiative (clinics) means that there is huge vertical integration going on in the healthcare sector here. Vertical integration, however, is something that usually pays off dividends and it has here with every quarter since then beating analyst expectations by a strong margin. To add to this, CVS has a food and drink segment in their stores that can bring people into their stores for multiple things (Though they intend to downsize it in favor of the higher profit margin medicinal stuff). This adds to the synergy that CVS has among their product placement. To add to this their CVS carecard benefits are sizeable enough to attract return customers, and they are doing Pharmacy delivery. they also have an online presence, though I admit that I am not too versed in their online presence. There were concerns about the large debt on their balance sheet after the acquisition of Aetna but it's been allayed by management's firm commitment to bring their debt under control by focusing on debt repayment as well as halting any dividend increases until their debt to equity ratio (and their long term debt) is under control. However, with a dividend of over 3.5% that remains serviceable due to extremely strong FCF this is a good stock to hold and wait with. As this is an election year, there will be price pressure on the stock and there is a strong technical resistance at the 75-77 range, and I expect that it will remain this way until the catalyst that is the elections have concluded in November. However, I expect a more minor catalyst could break the technical range should Biden win Michigan's Primary, as well as the Southern Election state of Florida in a convincing manner ensuring that he becomes the democratic nominee. This minor catalyst will only take effect if the Coronavirus situation stabilizes and confidence is restored in the markets. I do not think that likely. I believe that there is 30-35% upside between now and November, and a (conservatively) further 10-20% upside after November 2020. With a P/E ratio of 12.63, and a Forward P/E ratio of 8.98 I believe this is completely doable, and what's more that CVS is meaningfully undervalued. I am initiating a Strong Buy rating. Note: I have a position in CVS and intend to increase my position in CVS Industrial Strocks: General Electric - Strong Buy Let me start off by stating that Larry Culp is a Rockstar among industrial CEO's and his tenure among GE has ensured that GE will not be going bankrupt. He has exceeded analyst expectations every single quarter since taking the top job at GE, and instituted a strong turnaround. Which is why it is puzzling to me that GE Is at $8.22 at current, especially when GE's most prominent ex bear admitted that he was wrong about GE (Under Culp's leadership) and changed his sell rating to a hold rating with a 8$ price target, a touch under 3% where it's at currently. Take into account that Larry Culp has also reiterated that while first quarter FCF will be hit, the full year forecast remains unchanged. This is to be expected because GE's aviation FCF is set in stone. Boeing, nervous about GE (And Saffron's) talks with Airbus about becoming their secondary supplier has agreed to pay for all the engine's delivered last year and pay for deliveries of ten engines a month for this year. I would trust Culp's words, barring extreme circumstances. GE's other businesses are stable and are growing at a more moderate pace than their aviation business, but are still well positioned. GE Finance and GE's pension system has been stabilized, and should not present any more negative surprises. In fact GE's finance arm may be better than originally thought. You can expect GE to return to its 13+ high's and reach around 15 by the end of the year should the coronavirus end by the summer. I'm initiating a Strong Buy Rating and adding to my position. Automative: GM - Strong Buy GM CEO Mary Barra is a forward thinking CEO, and if not for the micro pressures pressing down GM's stock would be much higher than it is right now. Her investor day conference was a knock out of the park, and her willingness to control the means of production and vertically integrate by producing battery packs means that she can push down prices and increase margins. The modability of the battery packs is revolutionary and also ensures that prices and design cost can be kept low. Finally, the way that their batteries and battery packs are designed allows for a range of 400 miles which means that consumers will be more willing to purchase Electric Vehicles. The advent of electric vehicles also means that supply chains will become more simplified, as well as labor costs because they are less complex to make than ICE cars. GM's P/E ratio of 5.70 is indication of this. While the auto sector is cyclical, and this black swan event can further depress buyer sentiment I believe GM's balance sheet is strong enough to withstand any short or medium term shock. With a dividend yield of almost 6% that is safe, this is a strong buy and hold if only because the company is so severely oversold it is ludicrous. Initiating a Strong Buy Rating, and adding to my position. Ford- To be talked about another time, but it is an admittedly riskier play. Retail: Macy's - Strong Buy With the retail apocalypse, it's sometimes hard to look at individual stocks and see compelling value but I strongly believe in May's strategy and their execution. Past performance, is not indicative of future performance and what was overvalued a year ago is, I believe, now sharply undervalued. The first thing to acknowledge is Macy's debt, and whether they can service the almost 14% dividend. Due to Macy's resolve to lower their debt, and their redemption of bonds over the years unlike other retailers their debt is low and quite serviceable. Furthermore, Macy's is adopting to changing times, by cutting a further 125 department stores and cutting over 9,000 jobs mostly in corporate. This will initiate 1-1.1 billion in cost savings and cash. It's important to note that traffic in wealthy and affluent malls is still strong and that is where Macy's intends to remain. Additionally the stores they are adding with their Market by Macy's strategy will cost less, have higher margin, and tracks with consumer trends. Consumers spend more, and stay longer around these lifestyle centers than their counterparts in malls. Lastly, they intend to grow their higher margin private consumer label, and integrate their promising off the shelf stores with their main department stores which has been shown to increase consumer spending. Combine this with the steps they've taken with online consumers, and their promising beauty brands and their turnaround strategy seems to be working. The facts show it as they've beaten analyst expectations the last 2 quarters. The only question is whether they can service their dividend, and the answer is yes, as their dividend costs 440 (or 470 I need to recheck) million a year. FCF, cost cutting, and better integration as well as low debt relative to their peers ensures this. With an average return of 50 percent over 5 years, the dividend alone exceeds this and I expect the stock to appreciate as their turnaround strategy bears more fruit. It's a good IRA holding if nothing else. Furthermore, with a P/E of 6.35 it's a steal. I am initiating a Buy Rating and intend to buy shares of Macy's.

While these have paid off for me, I can understand if people have less risk tolerance and I will indicate in my analysis if companies are in a turnaround due to market conditions or poor prior financial performance.","Dude thank you for this, I'm gonna read into it more during break at work.

Retail: Macy's - Strong Buy With the retail apocalypse, it's sometimes hard to look at individual stocks and see compelling value but I strongly believe in May's strategy and their execution. Past performance, is not indicative of future performance and what was overvalued a year ago is, I believe, now sharply undervalued. The first thing to acknowledge is Macy's debt, and whether they can service the almost 14% dividend. Due to Macy's resolve to lower their debt, and their redemption of bonds over the years unlike other retailers their debt is low and quite serviceable. Furthermore, Macy's is adopting to changing times, by cutting a further 125 department stores and cutting over 9,000 jobs mostly in corporate. This will initiate 1-1.1 billion in cost savings and cash. It's important to note that traffic in wealthy and affluent malls is still strong and that is where Macy's intends to remain. Additionally the stores they are adding with their Market by Macy's strategy will cost less, have higher margin, and tracks with consumer trends. Consumers spend more, and stay longer around these lifestyle centers than their counterparts in malls. Lastly, they intend to grow their higher margin private consumer label, and integrate their promising off the shelf stores with their main department stores which has been shown to increase consumer spending. Combine this with the steps they've taken with online consumers, and their promising beauty brands and their turnaround strategy seems to be working. The facts show it as they've beaten analyst expectations the last 2 quarters. The only question is whether they can service their dividend, and the answer is yes, as their dividend costs 440 (or 470 I need to recheck) million a year. FCF, cost cutting, and better integration as well as low debt relative to their peers ensures this. With an average return of 50 percent over 5 years, the dividend alone exceeds this and I expect the stock to appreciate as their turnaround strategy bears more fruit. It's a good IRA holding if nothing else. Furthermore, with a P/E of 6.35 it's a steal. I am initiating a Buy Rating and intend to buy shares of Macy's.

Healthcare Stocks: CVS - Strong Buy CVS's acquisition of AETNA was viewed as a colossally risky gamble, or a stroke of genius last year. From a high of over 100$ to 52$, CVS needed to do something to shake things up and to their credit management has. The acquisition of Aetna, CVS's position as a Pharmacy Benefits Manager, and their retooling of their stores to sell more medically oriented merchandise such as vitamins as well as their reorientation to service people with chronic illnesses with their HEALTHHUB initiative (clinics) means that there is huge vertical integration going on in the healthcare sector here. Vertical integration, however, is something that usually pays off dividends and it has here with every quarter since then beating analyst expectations by a strong margin. To add to this, CVS has a food and drink segment in their stores that can bring people into their stores for multiple things (Though they intend to downsize it in favor of the higher profit margin medicinal stuff). This adds to the synergy that CVS has among their product placement. To add to this their CVS carecard benefits are sizeable enough to attract return customers, and they are doing Pharmacy delivery. they also have an online presence, though I admit that I am not too versed in their online presence. There were concerns about the large debt on their balance sheet after the acquisition of Aetna but it's been allayed by management's firm commitment to bring their debt under control by focusing on debt repayment as well as halting any dividend increases until their debt to equity ratio (and their long term debt) is under control. However, with a dividend of over 3.5% that remains serviceable due to extremely strong FCF this is a good stock to hold and wait with. As this is an election year, there will be price pressure on the stock and there is a strong technical resistance at the 75-77 range, and I expect that it will remain this way until the catalyst that is the elections have concluded in November. However, I expect a more minor catalyst could break the technical range should Biden win Michigan's Primary, as well as the Southern Election state of Florida in a convincing manner ensuring that he becomes the democratic nominee. This minor catalyst will only take effect if the Coronavirus situation stabilizes and confidence is restored in the markets. I do not think that likely. I believe that there is 30-35% upside between now and November, and a (conservatively) further 10-20% upside after November 2020. With a P/E ratio of 12.63, and a Forward P/E ratio of 8.98 I believe this is completely doable, and what's more that CVS is meaningfully undervalued. I am initiating a Strong Buy rating. Note: I have a position in CVS and intend to increase my position in CVS Industrial Strocks: General Electric - Strong Buy Let me start off by stating that Larry Culp is a Rockstar among industrial CEO's and his tenure among GE has ensured that GE will not be going bankrupt. He has exceeded analyst expectations every single quarter since taking the top job at GE, and instituted a strong turnaround. Which is why it is puzzling to me that GE Is at $8.22 at current, especially when GE's most prominent ex bear admitted that he was wrong about GE (Under Culp's leadership) and changed his sell rating to a hold rating with a 8$ price target, a touch under 3% where it's at currently. Take into account that Larry Culp has also reiterated that while first quarter FCF will be hit, the full year forecast remains unchanged. This is to be expected because GE's aviation FCF is set in stone. Boeing, nervous about GE (And Saffron's) talks with Airbus about becoming their secondary supplier has agreed to pay for all the engine's delivered last year and pay for deliveries of ten engines a month for this year. I would trust Culp's words, barring extreme circumstances. GE's other businesses are stable and are growing at a more moderate pace than their aviation business, but are still well positioned. GE Finance and GE's pension system has been stabilized, and should not present any more negative surprises. In fact GE's finance arm may be better than originally thought.

If Medicare for all or some other form of nationalized healthcare happens in the US, I think the biggest losers will be PBMs. Looks a little less likely with Biden ahead of Bernie, but coronavirus May be showing people why they should care about everyone else getting healthcare if they don’t already from a moral standpoint (i.e. the case to care from a purely selfish standpoint is being made right now). PBMs are basically middlemen who add minimal value to the healthcare market and would be cut out with a US NHS. So maintain in your assessment a nonzero chance of a huge part of CVS’s business evaporating overnight due to a policy change.Also, CVS expansion into basic medical care delivery in their physical locations is also highly risky with potential shift to telemedicine. It could leave them with a bunch of highly paid, underutilized HCPs if they aren’t willing to cut their losses quickly if telemedicine really takes off.",0,0.52,NEGATIVE,1.0

It might still happen, but when i really think of a worst case scenario for CVS where Bernie wins i just don't envision that he'll have the necessary support in the senate for Medicare for All. There woudn't even be enough democrat support for that. I unfortunately don't think there will be any long term legislation as a consequence of the coronavirus. However, i am slightly more optimistic that voter priorities may shift, though it will take around 4 years to trickle down as incumbents shift or are removed due to the issue of M4A.I agree with your analysis of PBM's, but i don't think they'll be destroyed. Instead their margins will be compressed (they'll be less profitable) if we follow the NHS model of the UK.I know United has telemedicine, and i want to say that Aetna has it too (though this is conjecture). As a health insurer, CVS is not a wholesale loser from the advent of telemedicine if it adopts wider practice. I DO know that some companies are looking at it and allowing it as a secondary option to keep healthcare costs down. I am still, however, unconvinced that this will become the norm due to malpractice lawsuit potential and the fact that physicians work best when they are face to face. Patients would also feel better, but that point is conjecture and i have no factual study for it other than that I personally would feel better with face to face meetings (Though i will point to the ""If you like your physician you can keep your physician"" Obama moment to prove my point)",1,0.512,NEGATIVE,0.999

Healthcare Stocks: CVS - Strong Buy CVS's acquisition of AETNA was viewed as a colossally risky gamble, or a stroke of genius last year. From a high of over 100$ to 52$, CVS needed to do something to shake things up and to their credit management has. The acquisition of Aetna, CVS's position as a Pharmacy Benefits Manager, and their retooling of their stores to sell more medically oriented merchandise such as vitamins as well as their reorientation to service people with chronic illnesses with their HEALTHHUB initiative (clinics) means that there is huge vertical integration going on in the healthcare sector here. Vertical integration, however, is something that usually pays off dividends and it has here with every quarter since then beating analyst expectations by a strong margin. To add to this, CVS has a food and drink segment in their stores that can bring people into their stores for multiple things (Though they intend to downsize it in favor of the higher profit margin medicinal stuff). This adds to the synergy that CVS has among their product placement. To add to this their CVS carecard benefits are sizeable enough to attract return customers, and they are doing Pharmacy delivery. they also have an online presence, though I admit that I am not too versed in their online presence. There were concerns about the large debt on their balance sheet after the acquisition of Aetna but it's been allayed by management's firm commitment to bring their debt under control by focusing on debt repayment as well as halting any dividend increases until their debt to equity ratio (and their long term debt) is under control. However, with a dividend of over 3.5% that remains serviceable due to extremely strong FCF this is a good stock to hold and wait with. As this is an election year, there will be price pressure on the stock and there is a strong technical resistance at the 75-77 range, and I expect that it will remain this way until the catalyst that is the elections have concluded in November. However, I expect a more minor catalyst could break the technical range should Biden win Michigan's Primary, as well as the Southern Election state of Florida in a convincing manner ensuring that he becomes the democratic nominee. This minor catalyst will only take effect if the Coronavirus situation stabilizes and confidence is restored in the markets. I do not think that likely. I believe that there is 30-35% upside between now and November, and a (conservatively) further 10-20% upside after November 2020. With a P/E ratio of 12.63, and a Forward P/E ratio of 8.98 I believe this is completely doable, and what's more that CVS is meaningfully undervalued. I am initiating a Strong Buy rating. Note: I have a position in CVS and intend to increase my position in CVS Industrial Strocks: General Electric - Strong Buy Let me start off by stating that Larry Culp is a Rockstar among industrial CEO's and his tenure among GE has ensured that GE will not be going bankrupt. He has exceeded analyst expectations every single quarter since taking the top job at GE, and instituted a strong turnaround. Which is why it is puzzling to me that GE Is at $8.22 at current, especially when GE's most prominent ex bear admitted that he was wrong about GE (Under Culp's leadership) and changed his sell rating to a hold rating with a 8$ price target, a touch under 3% where it's at currently. Take into account that Larry Culp has also reiterated that while first quarter FCF will be hit, the full year forecast remains unchanged. This is to be expected because GE's aviation FCF is set in stone. Boeing, nervous about GE (And Saffron's) talks with Airbus about becoming their secondary supplier has agreed to pay for all the engine's delivered last year and pay for deliveries of ten engines a month for this year. I would trust Culp's words, barring extreme circumstances. GE's other businesses are stable and are growing at a more moderate pace than their aviation business, but are still well positioned. GE Finance and GE's pension system has been stabilized, and should not present any more negative surprises. In fact GE's finance arm may be better than originally thought. You can expect GE to return to its 13+ high's and reach around 15 by the end of the year should the coronavirus end by the summer. I'm initiating a Strong Buy Rating and adding to my position. Automative: GM - Strong Buy GM CEO Mary Barra is a forward thinking CEO, and if not for the micro pressures pressing down GM's stock would be much higher than it is right now. Her investor day conference was a knock out of the park, and her willingness to control the means of production and vertically integrate by producing battery packs means that she can push down prices and increase margins. The modability of the battery packs is revolutionary and also ensures that prices and design cost can be kept low. Finally, the way that their batteries and battery packs are designed allows for a range of 400 miles which means that consumers will be more willing to purchase Electric Vehicles. The advent of electric vehicles also means that supply chains will become more simplified, as well as labor costs because they are less complex to make than ICE cars. GM's P/E ratio of 5.70 is indication of this. While the auto sector is cyclical, and this black swan event can further depress buyer sentiment I believe GM's balance sheet is strong enough to withstand any short or medium term shock. With a dividend yield of almost 6% that is safe, this is a strong buy and hold if only because the company is so severely oversold it is ludicrous.

Retail: Macy's - Strong Buy With the retail apocalypse, it's sometimes hard to look at individual stocks and see compelling value but I strongly believe in May's strategy and their execution. Past performance, is not indicative of future performance and what was overvalued a year ago is, I believe, now sharply undervalued. The first thing to acknowledge is Macy's debt, and whether they can service the almost 14% dividend. Due to Macy's resolve to lower their debt, and their redemption of bonds over the years unlike other retailers their debt is low and quite serviceable. Furthermore, Macy's is adopting to changing times, by cutting a further 125 department stores and cutting over 9,000 jobs mostly in corporate. This will initiate 1-1.1 billion in cost savings and cash. It's important to note that traffic in wealthy and affluent malls is still strong and that is where Macy's intends to remain. Additionally the stores they are adding with their Market by Macy's strategy will cost less, have higher margin, and tracks with consumer trends. Consumers spend more, and stay longer around these lifestyle centers than their counterparts in malls. Lastly, they intend to grow their higher margin private consumer label, and integrate their promising off the shelf stores with their main department stores which has been shown to increase consumer spending. Combine this with the steps they've taken with online consumers, and their promising beauty brands and their turnaround strategy seems to be working. The facts show it as they've beaten analyst expectations the last 2 quarters. The only question is whether they can service their dividend, and the answer is yes, as their dividend costs 440 (or 470 I need to recheck) million a year. FCF, cost cutting, and better integration as well as low debt relative to their peers ensures this. With an average return of 50 percent over 5 years, the dividend alone exceeds this and I expect the stock to appreciate as their turnaround strategy bears more fruit. It's a good IRA holding if nothing else. Furthermore, with a P/E of 6.35 it's a steal. I am initiating a Buy Rating and intend to buy shares of Macy's.

Which is why it is puzzling to me that GE Is at $8.22 at current, especially when GE's most prominent ex bear admitted that he was wrong about GE (Under Culp's leadership) and changed his sell rating to a hold rating with a 8$ price target, a touch under 3% where it's at currently. Take into account that Larry Culp has also reiterated that while first quarter FCF will be hit, the full year forecast remains unchanged. This is to be expected because GE's aviation FCF is set in stone. Boeing, nervous about GE (And Saffron's) talks with Airbus about becoming their secondary supplier has agreed to pay for all the engine's delivered last year and pay for deliveries of ten engines a month for this year. I would trust Culp's words, barring extreme circumstances. GE's other businesses are stable and are growing at a more moderate pace than their aviation business, but are still well positioned. GE Finance and GE's pension system has been stabilized, and should not present any more negative surprises. In fact GE's finance arm may be better than originally thought. You can expect GE to return to its 13+ high's and reach around 15 by the end of the year should the coronavirus end by the summer. I'm initiating a Strong Buy Rating and adding to my position. Automative: GM - Strong Buy GM CEO Mary Barra is a forward thinking CEO, and if not for the micro pressures pressing down GM's stock would be much higher than it is right now. Her investor day conference was a knock out of the park, and her willingness to control the means of production and vertically integrate by producing battery packs means that she can push down prices and increase margins. The modability of the battery packs is revolutionary and also ensures that prices and design cost can be kept low. Finally, the way that their batteries and battery packs are designed allows for a range of 400 miles which means that consumers will be more willing to purchase Electric Vehicles. The advent of electric vehicles also means that supply chains will become more simplified, as well as labor costs because they are less complex to make than ICE cars. GM's P/E ratio of 5.70 is indication of this. While the auto sector is cyclical, and this black swan event can further depress buyer sentiment I believe GM's balance sheet is strong enough to withstand any short or medium term shock. With a dividend yield of almost 6% that is safe, this is a strong buy and hold if only because the company is so severely oversold it is ludicrous. Initiating a Strong Buy Rating, and adding to my position. Ford- To be talked about another time, but it is an admittedly riskier play. Retail: Macy's - Strong Buy With the retail apocalypse, it's sometimes hard to look at individual stocks and see compelling value but I strongly believe in May's strategy and their execution. Past performance, is not indicative of future performance and what was overvalued a year ago is, I believe, now sharply undervalued. The first thing to acknowledge is Macy's debt, and whether they can service the almost 14% dividend. Due to Macy's resolve to lower their debt, and their redemption of bonds over the years unlike other retailers their debt is low and quite serviceable. Furthermore, Macy's is adopting to changing times, by cutting a further 125 department stores and cutting over 9,000 jobs mostly in corporate. This will initiate 1-1.1 billion in cost savings and cash. It's important to note that traffic in wealthy and affluent malls is still strong and that is where Macy's intends to remain. Additionally the stores they are adding with their Market by Macy's strategy will cost less, have higher margin, and tracks with consumer trends. Consumers spend more, and stay longer around these lifestyle centers than their counterparts in malls. Lastly, they intend to grow their higher margin private consumer label, and integrate their promising off the shelf stores with their main department stores which has been shown to increase consumer spending. Combine this with the steps they've taken with online consumers, and their promising beauty brands and their turnaround strategy seems to be working. The facts show it as they've beaten analyst expectations the last 2 quarters. The only question is whether they can service their dividend, and the answer is yes, as their dividend costs 440 (or 470 I need to recheck) million a year. FCF, cost cutting, and better integration as well as low debt relative to their peers ensures this. With an average return of 50 percent over 5 years, the dividend alone exceeds this and I expect the stock to appreciate as their turnaround strategy bears more fruit. It's a good IRA holding if nothing else. Furthermore, with a P/E of 6.35 it's a steal. I am initiating a Buy Rating and intend to buy shares of Macy's.

Please note that while I do like to invest in stalwarts, I also have an eye for turnarounds and invested in GE when it was still at risk of dying, as well as in Sprint before the merger when the stock was pricing in a no merger (This one was due to my background as a law student). While these have paid off for me, I can understand if people have less risk tolerance and I will indicate in my analysis if companies are in a turnaround due to market conditions or poor prior financial performance.","He didn't ask a question, shut up bot",1,0.501,NEGATIVE,0.998
