,"The Fourth Industrial Revolution is characterised by the fusion of the digital, biological, and physical worlds, as well as the growing utilisation of new technologies. It is the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes which include: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security Cloud Computing Ai Advanced Robotics / automation Big-data 3D printing Quantum computing (hypothetically) Robotic process automation (RPA) Semi-conductors Biotechnology / Healthcare IoT manufacturing Renewable energy Manufacturing / Mining Crypto (I have no experience in this besides some small positions in BTC and ETH, feel free to drop any DD and knowledge) Of course there's discussions which one are part of the industry 4.0 so I might be missing a few. since I believe that we are still at the start of this revolution, I want to invest in promising companies related to those industries. Some companies already have proven themselves, others are still in the 'startup' fase. Hereby a list of the companies from which I think are the best or will be the best in the corresponding sector. What sectors and which must-have companies am I missing? Note: some sectors are very broad so they might overlap. Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security CrowdStrike - $CRWD Offers a broad spectrum of solutions with the main goal of cyber-security. Some well-known clients where they have solved hacks are Sony Pictures and the DNC (Democratic National Committee). The company is the market leader in the cloud-based endpoint security segment and is also expanding into 5G network security. Cloudflare - $NET Offers a wide range of network services to companies around the world. Cloudflare's intelligent global network spans more than 200 cities in more than 100 countries. It provides network security and improved network performance and reliability to an increasing proportion of the total Internet used. More than 15% of the internet is used via Cloudflare BlackBerry - $BB They are working on AI powered cybersecurity They also work on QNX. QNX is a real-time embedded OS that controls software systems in (modern, especially EV) cars and forms the basis of solutions such as BlackBerry Radar, an IoT based asset tracking system for the transport sector. Spark Suites: Spark provides visibility and protection for all endpoints, including personal laptops and smartphones used for work. It uses AI, machine learning, and automation to provide better cyberattack prevention. SUMO LOGIC - $SUMO - DD from u/FlynnPierce SaaS platform focused on data analytics and they will likely be the first to be able to call themselves a cloud-native solution for continuous intelligence. To be fair, they themselves pioneer this concept of “continuous intelligence” where companies can have real-time insight and communication with their data. On March 10, 2021 they acquired DFLabs to enhance their cyber security offering, and claim that the SOAR system they inherit from the acquisition is 10x more effective in improving security operations productivity. Benefits over competitors: design and ease of use, scalability and oriented quality. Cloud Computing I'll include Amazon and Microsoft since they deserve a spot in this list. But Amazon and Microsoft are already some of the biggest in the world and make all sorts of stuff. It's entirely possible their innovations will be integral to aspects of the 4th Industrial Revolution, but it may also only be a relative drop or glass in the larger bucket that they currently represent.

Some of their business units are: The System Test Group: they build test machines for printed circuit boards and hard drives LifePoint: test machines for manufacturers of wireless modules and consumer electronics. Universal robots: provides collaborative robots (cobots) that work side by side with production workers. UR-cobots automate tasks such as machine loading, packaging, gluing, painting, polishing and assembling parts Mobile Industrial Robots: offers autonomous mobile robots for the management of internal logistics (for loads under 1,500 kg). These robots are currently used in the transportation, healthcare, pharmaceutical, metal and plastics, fashion, technology and food industries. AutoGuide Mobile Robots manufactures modular industrial mobile robots (for loads up to 45,000 kg). These high payload robots are used for assembly, material handling, storage and distribution across multiple industries. Cyberdyne - $CYBQY - Need DD ABB - $ABB - Need DD Big-data Palantir - $PLTR This is the way SalesForce - $CRM Big data CRM (big data customer relationship management) refers to the practice of integrating big data into a company's CRM processes with the goals of improving customer service, calculating return on investment on various initiatives and predicting clientele behavior. Salesforce is the leader in the CRM sector. Recently, Salesforce has acquired the big data firm “Tableau” for $15.3 billion and Slack for $27.7 billion, adding muscle in its fight with some major leaders. Moreover, the integration of Salesforce CRM and Big Data will enable businesses in analyzing customer patterns and preferences. SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD 3D Printing Desktop Metal - $DM Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors. They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time. They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials. Nano Dimension - DD is from their website Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries. It empowers companies to securely control entire development cycles through in-house additive manufacturing of PCBs and non-planar electronics with speed and precision, while reducing R&D costs. With it’s Lights-Out Digital Manufacturing (LDM) printing technology, this is the industry’s only comprehensive manufacturing printing platform for round-the-clock 3D printing of electronic circuitry. Markforged - $AONE - Need DD Quantum Computing IonQ - $DMYI A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do. So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult. This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits). It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit. Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.

There is obviously a massive need for these resources going forward and MP is the only chance the US has of competing with China in this demand. Of course, China operates in a market condition where they can exploit working conditions and the workforce in ways that American companies cannot, and MP claims to engage in their mining activity sustainably.

In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do. So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult. This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits). It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit. Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.

Moreover, the integration of Salesforce CRM and Big Data will enable businesses in analyzing customer patterns and preferences. SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD 3D Printing Desktop Metal - $DM Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors. They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time. They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed.

In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do.

Markforged - $AONE - Need DD Quantum Computing IonQ - $DMYI A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do. So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult. This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits). It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit. Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.

Markforged - $AONE - Need DD Quantum Computing IonQ - $DMYI A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do. So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult. This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits). It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit. Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.

Salesforce is the leader in the CRM sector. Recently, Salesforce has acquired the big data firm “Tableau” for $15.3 billion and Slack for $27.7 billion, adding muscle in its fight with some major leaders.

SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD 3D Printing Desktop Metal - $DM Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors. They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time. They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials. Nano Dimension - DD is from their website Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries. It empowers companies to securely control entire development cycles through in-house additive manufacturing of PCBs and non-planar electronics with speed and precision, while reducing R&D costs.

Markforged - $AONE - Need DD Quantum Computing IonQ - $DMYI A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do. So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult. This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits). It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit. Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.

SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD 3D Printing Desktop Metal - $DM Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors. They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time. They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials. Nano Dimension - DD is from their website Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries. It empowers companies to securely control entire development cycles through in-house additive manufacturing of PCBs and non-planar electronics with speed and precision, while reducing R&D costs.

Markforged - $AONE - Need DD Quantum Computing IonQ - $DMYI A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do. So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult. This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits). It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit. Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.

SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD 3D Printing Desktop Metal - $DM Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors. They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time. They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials.

In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do. So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult. This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits). It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit. Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.

Salesforce is the leader in the CRM sector. Recently, Salesforce has acquired the big data firm “Tableau” for $15.3 billion and Slack for $27.7 billion, adding muscle in its fight with some major leaders.

SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD 3D Printing Desktop Metal - $DM Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors. They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time. They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials. Nano Dimension - DD is from their website Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries. It empowers companies to securely control entire development cycles through in-house additive manufacturing of PCBs and non-planar electronics with speed and precision, while reducing R&D costs. With it’s Lights-Out Digital Manufacturing (LDM) printing technology, this is the industry’s only comprehensive manufacturing printing platform for round-the-clock 3D printing of electronic circuitry. Markforged - $AONE - Need DD Quantum Computing IonQ - $DMYI A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do. So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult. This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits). It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit. Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.

SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD 3D Printing Desktop Metal - $DM Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors. They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time. They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials. Nano Dimension - DD is from their website Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries. It empowers companies to securely control entire development cycles through in-house additive manufacturing of PCBs and non-planar electronics with speed and precision, while reducing R&D costs.

Markforged - $AONE - Need DD Quantum Computing IonQ - $DMYI A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do. So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult. This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits). It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit. Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.

Now I don't know if OP's companies are gonna be the ones to bring about AI, or quantum computing, but these technologies are going to revolutionize our world in way that not even the industrial revolution did.We are all going to blown out of the water over the next few decades by the rate of technological change we see. As a forum for supposedly long-term investors, I'm surprised many here are taking such a short-sighted view on OP's thesis. Yes, EVs, autonomous cars, green energy, and so on are in a bubble right now; that doesn't take away from the fact that over the long term these industries will grow massively. Yes, AI is overhyped right now, but even possibly within the decade many low-skilled jobs will be automated away. Biotech companies are on the cusp of figuring out how 3D print organs. The stage is set, it's just a matter of time before the curtains pull back.If you were standing on the cusp of the digital revolution in the 70s, you might have had trouble picking Apple as a winner, but you would have been a fool not to realize what the trend was while more and more things around you slowly sprouted computer chips.

Markforged - $AONE - Need DD Quantum Computing IonQ - $DMYI A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do. So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult. This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits). It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit. Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.

Hopefully we can add to it as time goes on. I think some of these sectors are still just getting started, so a lot of the best companies remain private. They dont want to be apart of the SPAC madness and they have plenty of ways to raise money privately.I think the talk of a bubble is reasonable. A lot of companies have been hot and seen huge interest. It is also a numbers game. To the point I made above, if x number of people are interested in a sector, but only 2 or 3 companies are publicly traded in that area, those companies will explode. As time goes on, you hope to see more companies coming public which will cool off the first companies to go public and better satisfy investor demand.The main differences between now and 1999 Bubble is interest rates and diversity of tech companies. In 1999, I think you could get a 5% risk-free yield. You get a fraction of that today. It was much easier to sell your stocks and go into bonds back then than it is now. Also, a lot of the tech titans in today's market have huge moots and good balance sheets. Some companies were in good shape back in 1999/2000, but I think it is tough to compare any to the titans of today. But no doubt in a list of 10 high growth/high valuation stocks, maybe 1-3 actually become highly successful long term.Of your list, I like cybersecurity and semiconductors. I like 3D printing, but I think the better play might be industries that will largely benefit from 3D printing.

SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD 3D Printing Desktop Metal - $DM Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors. They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time. They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed.

Markforged - $AONE - Need DD Quantum Computing IonQ - $DMYI A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do. So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult. This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits). It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit. Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.

SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD 3D Printing Desktop Metal - $DM Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors. They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time. They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials. Nano Dimension - DD is from their website Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries. It empowers companies to securely control entire development cycles through in-house additive manufacturing of PCBs and non-planar electronics with speed and precision, while reducing R&D costs. With it’s Lights-Out Digital Manufacturing (LDM) printing technology, this is the industry’s only comprehensive manufacturing printing platform for round-the-clock 3D printing of electronic circuitry. Markforged - $AONE - Need DD Quantum Computing IonQ - $DMYI A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do. So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult. This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits). It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit. Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.

In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do. So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult. This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits). It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit. Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.

Salesforce is the leader in the CRM sector. Recently, Salesforce has acquired the big data firm “Tableau” for $15.3 billion and Slack for $27.7 billion, adding muscle in its fight with some major leaders. Moreover, the integration of Salesforce CRM and Big Data will enable businesses in analyzing customer patterns and preferences. SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD 3D Printing Desktop Metal - $DM Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors. They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time. They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products.

Markforged - $AONE - Need DD Quantum Computing IonQ - $DMYI A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do. So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult. This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits). It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit. Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.

SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD 3D Printing Desktop Metal - $DM Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors. They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time. They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials.

Markforged - $AONE - Need DD Quantum Computing IonQ - $DMYI A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do. So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult. This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits). It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit. Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.

Markforged - $AONE - Need DD Quantum Computing IonQ - $DMYI A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do. So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult. This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits). It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit. Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.

Some companies already have proven themselves, others are still in the 'startup' fase. Hereby a list of the companies from which I think are the best or will be the best in the corresponding sector. What sectors and which must-have companies am I missing? Note: some sectors are very broad so they might overlap. Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security CrowdStrike - $CRWD Offers a broad spectrum of solutions with the main goal of cyber-security. Some well-known clients where they have solved hacks are Sony Pictures and the DNC (Democratic National Committee). The company is the market leader in the cloud-based endpoint security segment and is also expanding into 5G network security. Cloudflare - $NET Offers a wide range of network services to companies around the world. Cloudflare's intelligent global network spans more than 200 cities in more than 100 countries. It provides network security and improved network performance and reliability to an increasing proportion of the total Internet used.

QNX is a real-time embedded OS that controls software systems in (modern, especially EV) cars and forms the basis of solutions such as BlackBerry Radar, an IoT based asset tracking system for the transport sector. Spark Suites: Spark provides visibility and protection for all endpoints, including personal laptops and smartphones used for work. It uses AI, machine learning, and automation to provide better cyberattack prevention. SUMO LOGIC - $SUMO - DD from u/FlynnPierce SaaS platform focused on data analytics and they will likely be the first to be able to call themselves a cloud-native solution for continuous intelligence. To be fair, they themselves pioneer this concept of “continuous intelligence” where companies can have real-time insight and communication with their data. On March 10, 2021 they acquired DFLabs to enhance their cyber security offering, and claim that the SOAR system they inherit from the acquisition is 10x more effective in improving security operations productivity. Benefits over competitors: design and ease of use, scalability and oriented quality. Cloud Computing I'll include Amazon and Microsoft since they deserve a spot in this list. But Amazon and Microsoft are already some of the biggest in the world and make all sorts of stuff.

Surely we can do better than that. those are both all hype, little substance. SNOW runs on the same payment model as Google BigQuery, and Amazon Redshift is the king of columnar databases for massive queries right now, and Snowflake doesn't provide enough of a value add for most buisinesses to consider switching away from AWS. For certain niche companies who only infrequently have to run very massive queries (hint: nothing like PLTR, Netflix, Amazon, etc) it makes business sense. For 70% of customers it probably doesn't. AWS, GCP, MSFT and then Snowflake in that order is probably how it will go.PLTR is a new-age consultancy with a sexy home-grown analytics app. But you have to hire a team of engineers/consultants both for deployment and usage... it's not a scalable process whatsoever. I own PLTR, for full disclosure. I don't think they'll rise much for 12-18 months or until they figure out the scalability issue.""Big Data"" doesn't really mean anything. Or rather it means a lot of things, so I'm not sure specifically which aspect you are talking about since SNOW is storage and databases and PLTR is consulting analytics. But Datadog, Databricks, Segment, Mixpanel, Amplitude, Cloudera, Google, Facebook, IBM, Microsoft, New Relic are going to be winners in this space.

It uses AI, machine learning, and automation to provide better cyberattack prevention. SUMO LOGIC - $SUMO - DD from u/FlynnPierce SaaS platform focused on data analytics and they will likely be the first to be able to call themselves a cloud-native solution for continuous intelligence. To be fair, they themselves pioneer this concept of “continuous intelligence” where companies can have real-time insight and communication with their data. On March 10, 2021 they acquired DFLabs to enhance their cyber security offering, and claim that the SOAR system they inherit from the acquisition is 10x more effective in improving security operations productivity. Benefits over competitors: design and ease of use, scalability and oriented quality. Cloud Computing I'll include Amazon and Microsoft since they deserve a spot in this list. But Amazon and Microsoft are already some of the biggest in the world and make all sorts of stuff.

Salesforce is the leader in the CRM sector. Recently, Salesforce has acquired the big data firm “Tableau” for $15.3 billion and Slack for $27.7 billion, adding muscle in its fight with some major leaders. Moreover, the integration of Salesforce CRM and Big Data will enable businesses in analyzing customer patterns and preferences. SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD 3D Printing Desktop Metal - $DM Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors. They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time. They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials. Nano Dimension - DD is from their website Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries. It empowers companies to securely control entire development cycles through in-house additive manufacturing of PCBs and non-planar electronics with speed and precision, while reducing R&D costs. With it’s Lights-Out Digital Manufacturing (LDM) printing technology, this is the industry’s only comprehensive manufacturing printing platform for round-the-clock 3D printing of electronic circuitry. Markforged - $AONE - Need DD Quantum Computing IonQ - $DMYI A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do. So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult. This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits). It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit. Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.

It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time. They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products.

Markforged - $AONE - Need DD Quantum Computing IonQ - $DMYI A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do. So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult. This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits). It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit. Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.

There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do. So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult. This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits). It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit.

It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time. They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials.

Markforged - $AONE - Need DD Quantum Computing IonQ - $DMYI A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do. So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult. This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits). It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit. Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.

SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD 3D Printing Desktop Metal - $DM Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors. They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time. They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials. Nano Dimension - DD is from their website Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries. It empowers companies to securely control entire development cycles through in-house additive manufacturing of PCBs and non-planar electronics with speed and precision, while reducing R&D costs. With it’s Lights-Out Digital Manufacturing (LDM) printing technology, this is the industry’s only comprehensive manufacturing printing platform for round-the-clock 3D printing of electronic circuitry. Markforged - $AONE - Need DD Quantum Computing IonQ - $DMYI A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do. So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult. This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits). It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit. Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.

Markforged - $AONE - Need DD Quantum Computing IonQ - $DMYI A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do. So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult. This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits). It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit. Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.

Cyberdyne - $CYBQY - Need DD ABB - $ABB - Need DD Big-data Palantir - $PLTR This is the way SalesForce - $CRM Big data CRM (big data customer relationship management) refers to the practice of integrating big data into a company's CRM processes with the goals of improving customer service, calculating return on investment on various initiatives and predicting clientele behavior. Salesforce is the leader in the CRM sector. Recently, Salesforce has acquired the big data firm “Tableau” for $15.3 billion and Slack for $27.7 billion, adding muscle in its fight with some major leaders. Moreover, the integration of Salesforce CRM and Big Data will enable businesses in analyzing customer patterns and preferences. SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD 3D Printing Desktop Metal - $DM Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors. They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time. They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials. Nano Dimension - DD is from their website Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries. It empowers companies to securely control entire development cycles through in-house additive manufacturing of PCBs and non-planar electronics with speed and precision, while reducing R&D costs. With it’s Lights-Out Digital Manufacturing (LDM) printing technology, this is the industry’s only comprehensive manufacturing printing platform for round-the-clock 3D printing of electronic circuitry. Markforged - $AONE - Need DD Quantum Computing IonQ - $DMYI A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do. So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult. This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits). It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit. Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.

There is obviously a massive need for these resources going forward and MP is the only chance the US has of competing with China in this demand. Of course, China operates in a market condition where they can exploit working conditions and the workforce in ways that American companies cannot, and MP claims to engage in their mining activity sustainably.

SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD 3D Printing Desktop Metal - $DM Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors. They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time. They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed.

Markforged - $AONE - Need DD Quantum Computing IonQ - $DMYI A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do. So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult. This is where error correction becomes important.

SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD 3D Printing Desktop Metal - $DM Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors. They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time. They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials. Nano Dimension - DD is from their website Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries. It empowers companies to securely control entire development cycles through in-house additive manufacturing of PCBs and non-planar electronics with speed and precision, while reducing R&D costs.

Markforged - $AONE - Need DD Quantum Computing IonQ - $DMYI A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do. So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult. This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits). It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit. Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.

Moreover, the integration of Salesforce CRM and Big Data will enable businesses in analyzing customer patterns and preferences. SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD 3D Printing Desktop Metal - $DM Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors. They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time. They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials. Nano Dimension - DD is from their website Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries. It empowers companies to securely control entire development cycles through in-house additive manufacturing of PCBs and non-planar electronics with speed and precision, while reducing R&D costs. With it’s Lights-Out Digital Manufacturing (LDM) printing technology, this is the industry’s only comprehensive manufacturing printing platform for round-the-clock 3D printing of electronic circuitry. Markforged - $AONE - Need DD Quantum Computing IonQ - $DMYI A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do. So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult. This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits). It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit. Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.

This resource provides the essential metallic and magnetic raw materials used in most modern technology from Electric Vehicles to windmills and robotic arms. Yeah. That’s HUGE. There is obviously a massive need for these resources going forward and MP is the only chance the US has of competing with China in this demand. Of course, China operates in a market condition where they can exploit working conditions and the workforce in ways that American companies cannot, and MP claims to engage in their mining activity sustainably. Noting that MP (Mountian Pass) Mine is in California, we can assume they are doing their best to remain in compliance with a green energy future.

,"The Fourth Industrial Revolution is characterised by the fusion of the digital, biological, and physical worlds, as well as the growing utilisation of new technologies. It is the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes which include: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security Cloud Computing Ai Advanced Robotics / automation Big-data 3D printing Quantum computing (hypothetically) Robotic process automation (RPA) Semi-conductors Biotechnology / Healthcare IoT manufacturing Renewable energy Manufacturing / Mining Crypto (I have no experience in this besides some small positions in BTC and ETH, feel free to drop any DD and knowledge) Of course there's discussions which one are part of the industry 4.0 so I might be missing a few. since I believe that we are still at the start of this revolution, I want to invest in promising companies related to those industries. Some companies already have proven themselves, others are still in the 'startup' fase. Hereby a list of the companies from which I think are the best or will be the best in the corresponding sector. What sectors and which must-have companies am I missing? Note: some sectors are very broad so they might overlap. Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security CrowdStrike - $CRWD Offers a broad spectrum of solutions with the main goal of cyber-security. Some well-known clients where they have solved hacks are Sony Pictures and the DNC (Democratic National Committee). The company is the market leader in the cloud-based endpoint security segment and is also expanding into 5G network security. Cloudflare - $NET Offers a wide range of network services to companies around the world. Cloudflare's intelligent global network spans more than 200 cities in more than 100 countries. It provides network security and improved network performance and reliability to an increasing proportion of the total Internet used. More than 15% of the internet is used via Cloudflare BlackBerry - $BB They are working on AI powered cybersecurity They also work on QNX. QNX is a real-time embedded OS that controls software systems in (modern, especially EV) cars and forms the basis of solutions such as BlackBerry Radar, an IoT based asset tracking system for the transport sector. Spark Suites: Spark provides visibility and protection for all endpoints, including personal laptops and smartphones used for work. It uses AI, machine learning, and automation to provide better cyberattack prevention. SUMO LOGIC - $SUMO - DD from u/FlynnPierce SaaS platform focused on data analytics and they will likely be the first to be able to call themselves a cloud-native solution for continuous intelligence. To be fair, they themselves pioneer this concept of “continuous intelligence” where companies can have real-time insight and communication with their data. On March 10, 2021 they acquired DFLabs to enhance their cyber security offering, and claim that the SOAR system they inherit from the acquisition is 10x more effective in improving security operations productivity. Benefits over competitors: design and ease of use, scalability and oriented quality. Cloud Computing I'll include Amazon and Microsoft since they deserve a spot in this list. But Amazon and Microsoft are already some of the biggest in the world and make all sorts of stuff. It's entirely possible their innovations will be integral to aspects of the 4th Industrial Revolution, but it may also only be a relative drop or glass in the larger bucket that they currently represent.
