,I'm interested in getting some opinions about when to buy Arm stock with its IPO supposedly coming this week. The first thing that comes to mind is to wait for a big dip once it establishes a little bit of a track record before buying some for the long-term,I would personally stay far far away from the ARM IPO. SoftBank has been trying to offload it for years and regulators wouldn't let them sell it to Nvidia. This is too much SoftBank selling their bags to retail.,0,0.522,NEGATIVE,1.0

This isn't some startup you're getting in at ground zero, they were public before SoftBank acquired them in 2016.That sounds crazy to me, but I'm sure I'm missing information.",0,0.587,NEGATIVE,1.0
