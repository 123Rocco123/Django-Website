,"Key Stats for International Business Machines Corp. 105 years later and still going strong! I'm not talking about Warren Buffett who owns nearly 10% of IBM at an average price of circa $170! Ticker IBM Sector Other IT Services & Consulting Latest price $162.04 Value $154,885M Daily vol $471M Date 09 August 2016 Useful Links Latest news from Google Finance and Yahoo Finance Latest results from SEC Edgar Website: ibm.com Description International Business Machines Corporation has five segments: Global Technology Services (GTS), Global Business Services (GBS), Software, Systems Hardware and Global Financing. But you can probably think of it as a 2 trick pony: Software & IT Consulting. Sure they've got fancy things like Watson, but aren't they just marketing for their consulting arm? Recent financials It doesn't do them justice to look at 5 years, but here goes...sales keep slipping, earnings show no sign of progress, but the board keeps ramping the dividend and buying back stock in the billions. Metric 2015A 2014A 2013A 2012A 2011A Revenue $82bn $93bn $98bn $103bn $105bn EPS $13.42 $11.90 $14.94 $14.37 $13.06 DPS $5.00 $4.25 $3.70 $3.30 $2.90 Competition Not surprisingly they say The company is a globally-integrated enterprise, operating in more than 175 countries. The company participates in a highly competitive environment, where its competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more narrowly focused entities. Overall, across its business segments, the company recognizes hundreds of competitors worldwide. In IT, they mention: Accenture, Alphabet Inc. (Google), Amazon.com, Inc. (Amazon), Computer Sciences Corporation, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft); India-based service providers; the consulting practices of public accounting firms; and many companies that primarily focus on local markets or niche service areas. In Software they mention: CA, Inc., Microsoft, Oracle Corporation (Oracle), Salesforce.com and SAP. And given their business generates circa 50% of its cashflow from IT and Software, it's not surprising that the margin's higher than Accenture etc but lower than SAP etc. That aside, what's clear is they have exceptionally good returns. And although Buffett recognizes that competition is intense, they clearly have an expertise in their IT division that gives them an edge in terms of pricing and closing deals.
