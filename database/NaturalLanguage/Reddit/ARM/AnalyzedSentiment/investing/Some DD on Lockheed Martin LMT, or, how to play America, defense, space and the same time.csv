I initially bought at 370 and keep buying more and more on its way down to 320s, so now I just broke even.According to Bloomberg, the defense budget proposal for next yr is flat compared to this year, or slightly down from last year if compared in real term. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/pentagon-crafting-next-budget-close-to-this-year-s-704-billion And the budget might be flat for a while because of the ballooning debt.LMT is facing serious pressure in reducing the cost of their F35 program. It still has a lot of issues/flaws to address before entering full-rate production. The full rate production approval had been delayed again and again. While I think it's unlikely that the F35 program will be cancelled altogether, the margins will probably be lower than anticipated because of all these cost reduction measure and all the political pressure.On the bright side:if its acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne is approved, then that'd be a boost to its space division. However, Raytheon and a few other companies are contesting that acquisition. Many analysts are expecting the deal to go through with some conditions, but if you buy LMT, then you need to be aware of this.Another bright point is that LMT's backlog is bigger than its current market cap. So there'd still be plenty of work even with the flat budget.If the F35 full rate production phase is delayed again, or the acquisition is denied, then be prepared for a drop. Overall, I bought it because i think it'd be a great loooong term hold (i'm thinking 5-10 yrs), so I'm ok with the volatility. But there's really no such thing as guaranteed easy money.",0,0.536,NEGATIVE,1.0

For great responses and actual discussion. Thanks. I am aware that RTX is contesting but I just read the odds of approval are high at around 80%. The two companies boards have also agreed on the terms and currently already have tons of overlap in terms of what they do and they actively work on projects together so the merger would be smoother than most. My money is on it going through. You’re dead on about the F35, costs are astronomical. But the program has 8 international partners and 6 other countries procuring them. Arms sales also serve as a form patronage or tribute towards us as well, meaning they keep buying, we keep protecting. I also was just informed on another comment about an increasingly toxic corporate culture, high turnovers, no promoting from within, hiring unqualified people, and mass charging for work that is not being done. All things on the con side.But the potential upside if/when another large scale conflict happens, or if they score this merger and position themselves as the leader in space security and defense, is simply too large to ignore. The fact that their financials are rock solid as well tips the scales firmly towards the bullish fro me.",1,0.527,NEGATIVE,0.513

The Atlas program is contracted for lots of DoD launches, yes, but a recent Space Force launch contract was split 50-50 between SpaceX and ULA.On the air-breathing side of their defense business, you’ve got the JSF contract, sure. But the DoD was so thoroughly burned by the cost overruns that it’s literally changing how it builds and designs military aircraft. To stay competitive LMT will need to change its engineering culture from a waterfall model to rapid prototyping. The dog days of cost plus contracts are ending.That said, I think they can get some big wins if they make progress on overhauling their culture. I just don’t think it is the rosy picture OP presents.

It sucks that there is such a cozy a relationship between business and military however.

It's going to be the easiest discretionary spending to cut when a Democrat-controlled government decides they need to hand out more financial aid and welfare money prior to the 2022 election. This doesn't take into account the cuts that will be needed to handle the COVID debt. On top of that, the DoD is horribly bloated and it's slowly fixing that, i.e. writing contracts without as much pork in them so that they can show how ""fiscally responsible"" they are.Second point, is that space now belongs to actual innovators like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, not slow, lazy contractors who are stuck in the 1980s like LMT and Boeing. There is likely going to be a cut in space spending soon as well so expect to see major programs that the traditional contractors are working on get cut in favor of SpaceX et al.Caveat Emptor: For legal reasons I must warn you that this is just my personal opinion and not the official position of the DoD, NASA, or the US Government, nor is it financial advice, and under no circumstances should it be construed as such.",0,0.509,NEGATIVE,1.0

I’ll believe the contraction in defense spending when I see it and even then I think it will be skewed more towards making the military more efficient as opposed to scaling back R&D and procurement. Your point in contracts is spot on though.As far as space. I am expecting there to be distinct, yet obviously interrelated, sectors: commercial, civil, and military. I know there is tons of overlap already but there is enough on that bottomless plate for everyone to eat. It is also unlikely ,Space Ex, SPCE or even Bezos, develop the relationship that currently exists between the war dogs and the DOD.
