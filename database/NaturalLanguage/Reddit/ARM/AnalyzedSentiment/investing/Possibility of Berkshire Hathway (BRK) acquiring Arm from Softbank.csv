,"Nvidia is in talks to buy ARM, but I'm pretty sure that they would encounter regulatory issues. I think ARM would be a pretty solid purchase for BRK. ARM received $2 billion from licensing fees in 2019 up from $1.2 billion in 2014, paying Softbank a great dividend with year over year increases. A whole lot of companies are switching to ARM CPU's, including Apple. Smart watches, VR/AR are the next big things most likely to use ARM. So, the growth potential for ARM in the future is huge. BRK has tanked a bit recently and this purchasing ARM would bolster their portfolio. They could also explore taking ARM public in a couple of years. And they do have a lot of IP's / patents. What do you guys think?","There’s one big problem you forgot....Buffet and Munger don’t invest in what they don’t understand, and tech is way outside of their circle of competence.And before you say “Well they bought Apple didn’t they?” Yeah they did...but it’s arguably just as much of a consumer “staple” as much as it is a tech company. People live on their phones now. Try going a week without your phone....hell try one day. That’s why he bought it and why he owns some tech. He’ll probably never buy another tech stock...let alone one that is in the semiconductor industry that has such fierce competition and complexity behind it.",0,0.54,NEGATIVE,1.0

What do you guys think?",True. But the other managers only control a small portion of the pie. If we were talking a full buy out I don’t think they have enough of the cash pile to make such a move and if they wanted to they would probably have to make some sales of their own “portfolio” that they control to do so. I’m just guessing as I don’t know for certain how much of the cash pile they control. I don’t think anyone really does. Otherwise I think they probably would have dumped way more into Amazon.,2,0.526,NEGATIVE,0.996
