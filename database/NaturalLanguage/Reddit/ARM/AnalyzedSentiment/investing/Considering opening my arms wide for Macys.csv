,"So as a pre-text, let me warn you I'm a swing and position technical trader. Haven't been here before but seems like most investors are strictly fundamentals by nature. The reason I've popped up on this board is M looks very intriguing based on a monthly chart. It's pulled right back into the lows from the dot com and 08 fiasco and it's blowing right through them with a high short interest. A quick turnaround could stick the newly aggressive bears and show the breakdown at this key point to be fake. So assuming we have a good technical reason to consider a shot here, I'd like to look at the fundamental side. First, at least in KS the Macys appear to be shut down, meaning no cash flow other than online shopping. Their debt/equity ratio according to yahoo finance is 110 and their quick ratio is 1.2, this could easily take them out. That being said, they're owned almost exclusively by institutions and while the virus may get a bit worse, it seems the chart has taken far worse already. Moving forward, do we really see this store not being open for black friday? If that's the case, interested in some of the LEAP calls Jan 2022 or outright stock. For those that played this in 08 or similar setups, is this best to simply look at it like Asymmetric Risk and either it goes bust or pays back 4-5x or is there a better approach to determining which dumpster fires are worth warming up by in this environment?","""It's pulled right back into the lows from the dot com and 08 fiasco and it's blowing right through them with a high short interest.""You had a business that was eroding (and that has been disrupted and not particularly well-managed) over the last 5 years in a fairly orderly manner before this and now is being nearly full stop halted by what's going on. Consumer spending at Macy's right now is questionable. Online is still available, but I can't imagine it's doing well at all. If people are spending on anything, it's staples as Costco has lines out the door and Amazon is clearly doing well.Also, holy shit I didn't see Macy's down another 20% today when I started writing this.Might it have a technical bounce? Sure. I just would really, really rather buy quality growth where I can have confidence in the long-term relevance of the business.Lastly, impressive that there was the activist position in Macy's by Starboard at $60 that pushed for a REIT spin-off, they sold at $30 and now it's $4. The Sears real estate thesis proved garbage and now people couldn't seem to care less about Macy's RE - which they really should have sold ages ago when Starboard pushed for it.""That being said, they're owned almost exclusively by institutions""That's not something I would go on. Institutions hold 2/3rds of GPRO stock.TLDR: Technical bounce? Possibly, sure. Personally, in this decline I'm really looking for quality growth where I have some degree of confidence in the business looking a few years out and Macy's isn't that. I don't know if I have any real confidence in Macy's a year out at this rate.",0,0.543,NEGATIVE,1.0
