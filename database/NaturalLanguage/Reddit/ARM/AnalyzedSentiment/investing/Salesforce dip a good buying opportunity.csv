,So Salesforce is down 5.37% today. A few questions: Will Salesforce take a moderate dip after the Slack acquisition? Does this dip represent a good buying opportunity? Will this affect Microsoft's stock price? Some speculate Microsoft might want to acquire a company as well to keep up the arm's race. Which one would you pick? The answer to the second question will also depend on whether you think the acquisition is good for Salesforce -- is this a great boost in users and capabilities to compete against Microsoft?,"Hi, welcome to r/investing.

If anyone can bring it against Microsoft in the CRM world and beyond, its him. Salesforce should be considered a ""baby FAANG"". They will have a double % share price jump on a likely upcoming earnings and all will be well. Usually the acquiring company share price goes down on announcement of a deal.I think the Slack buy is a great way to introduce many different companies to the complete Salesforce suite of products and get its foot into the door of younger companies. Besides, CRM sales price has rocketed up recently so it is like they are getting Slack for nothing.Saying all that, obviously I am long Salesforce and think it is a good buying opportunity.",0,0.556,POSITIVE,0.951

It’s not really about this stock or the market, it’s about you. Are you trading or investing? Do you care about the profit/loss percentages given the timeframe you want this position to work out? Are you the type of person who would baghold and check price every now and then? What is the maximim risks you are willing to take?With all that answered. If you (really) don’t care about a 20%~30% paper loss sitting in your account and the money you would be otherwise invested in something else. Why not? If you do care about prices, then just check all the technicals and volumes level to have a high probability long position. High probability does not mean you will be right.Salesforce software is the best product in the market right now.

I am in sales, my former company had Salesforce, and the current one has SAP. And I can tell you that Salesforce is superior to SAP.Let’s use S&P for example, even with market downturn, it typically does not return to previous price level 3 years back. Nasdaq? Probably not even 2 years back. So if you plan to hold it more than 3 years and just want to actually “own shares” of this company which you see great potential, anytime is a good time to buy. It’s part of your asset allocation.In terms of fundamentals and numbers, I don’t see any indications of it becoming less successful in near futures, but there’s risk to anything. Technically, it is not in down trend, it is in consolidation, meaning it can still go up and down after all the ticks are consolidated, the price is on cheaper side trend-wise (below point of control), but if you feel risk is your thing, it is time to chase. Short term price floor is around $220 to $230, as there was no transactions conducted around these areas, until there are of course. Midterm is $170 to $180. So if those risk levels are ok for you, why not buy now?",2,0.541,POSITIVE,0.928
