,"I saw this article on Mad Fientist and it made me curious what others think. I am 2 years into a 10-1 ARM at 2.63%. I am planning on saving and investing enough money over the next 8+ years to payoff my mortgage if/when the rate jumps too high. To do that, my original thought was to invest money in an after-tax brokerage account. After reading the article, I wonder if there is a better way. My situation: -401k through previous employer (paying off loan this year then moving to a traditional IRA, about $120,000) -401k through current employer (hope to max out this year) -401k through wife's employer (hope to max out next year) -MFJ -Retire in 20-25 years -One of us will be age 59.5 in 16 years -About $150,000 left on mortgage -22% tax bracket (don't expect this to change for awhile) -HSA maxed out each year -DINKs The article says a Roth Conversion Ladder is the best way, but 401k with penalty is not that far behind. If the money I am putting into the 401k was already earmarked for paying off the house or for other expenses that come with retiring early, am I wrong to think that leaving it in the 401k might be better? I have also considered SEPPs with my previous employer 401k. What would you do or recommend?","Brokerage account is fine since you have 8 years to invest. Do not take from your 401K or IRA, the penalty you pay will be more than whatever rate you would get. Alternatively, I would put money in a HYSA, tbills, or a mmf in the brokerage as well. You would be getting almost double your mortgage interest in something that is 100% safe.",0,0.516,NEGATIVE,0.995
