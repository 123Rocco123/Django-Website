,"Has anyone had experiences with investing in companies or funds with a socially conscious interest? I'm not looking for high gains or to beat the SP500 necessarily, but more for opportunities to support companies that do less evil, but have enough profit to keep going. Some of the areas of interest would be avoiding companies actively involved in: Fossil fuel extraction, distribution, extreme consumption Arms and munitions manufacturing Labor abuse Supporting authoritative or oppressive leaders Financial services that disadvantages lower income consumers (ie, payday loans) Private prisons Tobacco, alcohol, gambling industries Initially I'd like to investing in companies that avoid the above, but also looking companies that do the opposite such as renewable energies. Of course this would be after maxing out all retirement and tax sheltered accounts with traditional mainstream index funds.","Contrarian opinion: As long as you're not buying bonds or preferreds directly from the issuer, your investment choices do no really matter from an ethics standpoint. The stock market is a big second hand store / flea market: you're purchasing stock form other investors.However, if investing in cos with great ESG scores does make you feel better, it's totally valid.Personally: long TransAlta, BEP, T, looking at HASI, AY, LMRK, TRIG (UK), and others ...",0,0.544,POSITIVE,0.699

They also are increasingly using electricity generated from green sources to power their production. They are still pumping billions of tons of CO2 back into the atmosphere, but it's a good start.Arms and munitions manufacturingCompanies that make these include Lockheed Martin, also make vehicles, aircraft, satellites and vessels.Labor abusegood luck finding a publicly traded company that hasn't have some sort of labor exploitation.Supporting authoritative or oppressive leadersThat would rule out companies that do business with China, Russia, the Middle East, and USA. So an overwhelming majority of the world's productivity and economy.Financial services that disadvantages lower income consumers (ie, payday loans)Good luck finding a publicly traded financial company that doesn't do that.Private prisonsUnlike everything else you've listed this one is actually pretty easy to avoidTobacco, alcohol, gambling industriesPretty easy to avoid sin stocks like Altria etc.But at the end of the day, if you are not going to invest money in a company based on ethical reason, you're going to not make that much money off investing in the stock market.",0,0.545,NEGATIVE,0.997

If nothing else, just to support the businesses that took on less profitable positions to do good.The examples you provides are right on, and it is a challenge to untangle our consumeristic culture from some of the lesser-good traits I shared above.And so much of this is relative too. I may be ok with a company paying just the minimum wage, but labor abuse to me would be like the clothing sweatshops and overworked employees who commit suicide from the factory floor.",1,0.548,NEGATIVE,1.0

But where to stop? Afterall even FANG companies could be argued unethical. Enslaving masses to their screens rather than promoting outdoors activies causing neck, back and eyes issues as well as obesity. Enslaving masses to a virtual social life rather than real relationships. Cars kill more than guns and bullets. Big food industry creates mostly unhealthy too sweet food and drinks again leading to obesity. If you go that route there really aren't a lot of companies left to invest in. There are ethical funds, but an economy teacher of mine told me that those funds sometimes invest in other funds that look ethical as well but those might invest in unethical things. I'm not really sure about that and never followed the chain to check that because to me it doesn't matter. Feel free to dig, funds always publish what they invest in. Personally I don't care what a company does as I don't think my small contribution helps that company, however I'll be glad to take the profits that any company can give me nomatter what they do.Not trying to change your mind, ethical investment is possible, and is arguably good.
