,"Everyone's all excited about the BABA and Amazon! But isn't JD the real ecommerce king in China? Wal-mart thinks so. Key Stats for JD.Com Inc(ADR) Ticker JD Sector E-commerce & Auction Services Latest price $41.92 Value $59,877M Daily vol $419M Date 09 June 2017 Links Yahoo Finance, SEC Edgar, jd.com 1. Who's JD? He's not a person, stands for Jingdong. And it's the largest e-commerce business in China by sales, clocking up twice Alibaba's or Tencent's. But 50% of sales come from electronics and appliances & nearly 60% of sales is direct, so it's not exciting, eh? Now the business has morphed dramatically in the last 4 years: Electronic sales grew 60% a year, everything else 90% So it's down to 50% of total sales volume from 65% Direct sales, via their warehouse grew 60%, but their online marketplaces, where 3rd parties sell via their websites, grew 100% So direct sales is down to 57% of sales from 77%. Not surprisingly, this has helped cashflows... but more on that shortly. Though remember this is a warehouses business, so it's profile is more Amazon than Alibaba. To hit that home... they've over 210 warehouses with four million square meters in over 50 cities, and have physcial pickup points in 5,370 places across China. Yes, Amazon is copying JD. Oh, and don't forget that Wal-Mart owns 5% of JD, they sold their Chinese marketplace to them, have a Sam's Club partnership, etc etc. How the numbers look? It's hard not to be impressed by that growth at the top line, but the bottom line is really ugly. Metrics 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A Revenue (RMB) 41bn 69bn 115bn 181bn 260bn Operating profit (RMB) -2bn -1bn -6bn -6bn -2bn EPS -$2.18 -$1.47 -$5.35 -$3.33 -$1.36 Now, read the management team's latest presentation and they tell a different story! They point to share-compensation schemes and extra-ordinary items hitting the reported figures. In fact, they show a rather different picture from a ""free cash flow"" perspective! Metrics 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A Free cash flow (RMB) 0bn 2bn 1bn 7bn 16bn Nice? Well, it's 7% FCF margin, which sounds reasonable for the Amazon of China. And given they get paid by customers a lot faster than they pay out to their suppliers... the bigger they get the nicer their cashflow. And given the growth, they've got cash of the books. Shareholder friendly Well, show me a Chinese stock listed in the US that is! Though you can say the same about Google, Facebook, Snapchat, Under Armour, etc where the founders have control. And sometimes the decisions are a little murky. Recently they decided to spin off their finance arm JD Finance. Now they'll get $2bn in cash for their 69% and 40% of all future profits. Which is a similar deal to Alibaba's spin off of Alipay. But still. Why? Though in case of Alibaba, etc there is the added complexity of you owning an economic interest via a Cayman Islands' entity, rather than actually owning shares in the underlying business. 2. How's it compare? Shifting electronics via your own warehouses is far from exciting from a margin perspective.

,"Everyone's all excited about the BABA and Amazon! But isn't JD the real ecommerce king in China? Wal-mart thinks so. Key Stats for JD.Com Inc(ADR) Ticker JD Sector E-commerce & Auction Services Latest price $41.92 Value $59,877M Daily vol $419M Date 09 June 2017 Links Yahoo Finance, SEC Edgar, jd.com 1. Who's JD? He's not a person, stands for Jingdong. And it's the largest e-commerce business in China by sales, clocking up twice Alibaba's or Tencent's. But 50% of sales come from electronics and appliances & nearly 60% of sales is direct, so it's not exciting, eh? Now the business has morphed dramatically in the last 4 years: Electronic sales grew 60% a year, everything else 90% So it's down to 50% of total sales volume from 65% Direct sales, via their warehouse grew 60%, but their online marketplaces, where 3rd parties sell via their websites, grew 100% So direct sales is down to 57% of sales from 77%. Not surprisingly, this has helped cashflows... but more on that shortly. Though remember this is a warehouses business, so it's profile is more Amazon than Alibaba. To hit that home... they've over 210 warehouses with four million square meters in over 50 cities, and have physcial pickup points in 5,370 places across China. Yes, Amazon is copying JD. Oh, and don't forget that Wal-Mart owns 5% of JD, they sold their Chinese marketplace to them, have a Sam's Club partnership, etc etc. How the numbers look? It's hard not to be impressed by that growth at the top line, but the bottom line is really ugly. Metrics 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A Revenue (RMB) 41bn 69bn 115bn 181bn 260bn Operating profit (RMB) -2bn -1bn -6bn -6bn -2bn EPS -$2.18 -$1.47 -$5.35 -$3.33 -$1.36 Now, read the management team's latest presentation and they tell a different story! They point to share-compensation schemes and extra-ordinary items hitting the reported figures. In fact, they show a rather different picture from a ""free cash flow"" perspective! Metrics 2012A 2013A 2014A 2015A 2016A Free cash flow (RMB) 0bn 2bn 1bn 7bn 16bn Nice? Well, it's 7% FCF margin, which sounds reasonable for the Amazon of China. And given they get paid by customers a lot faster than they pay out to their suppliers... the bigger they get the nicer their cashflow. And given the growth, they've got cash of the books. Shareholder friendly Well, show me a Chinese stock listed in the US that is! Though you can say the same about Google, Facebook, Snapchat, Under Armour, etc where the founders have control. And sometimes the decisions are a little murky. Recently they decided to spin off their finance arm JD Finance. Now they'll get $2bn in cash for their 69% and 40% of all future profits. Which is a similar deal to Alibaba's spin off of Alipay. But still. Why? Though in case of Alibaba, etc there is the added complexity of you owning an economic interest via a Cayman Islands' entity, rather than actually owning shares in the underlying business. 2. How's it compare? Shifting electronics via your own warehouses is far from exciting from a margin perspective. The other Chinese majors listed in the US are substantially higher, but they are capital light / software ""heavy"" businesses.

My understanding is they were a first mover in terms of building out warehouse/fulfillment infrastructure before Alibaba so they have much faster delivery times.
