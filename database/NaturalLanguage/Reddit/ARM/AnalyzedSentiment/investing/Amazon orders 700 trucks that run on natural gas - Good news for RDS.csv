Now, just Amazon ordering a few hundred trucks would not swing the sector significantly by itself, but this could set a precedent for other companies to follow suit. As more and more companies set low carbon targets I wouldn't be surprised to see more stories about this. LNG is a less carbon intensive fuel than gasoline and diesel. A bit more on RDS: I've been long RDS through the COVID epidemic and its shares have been (in my opinion) very discounted over the last year primarily because it took an early, drastic step in re-basing (lowering) its dividend. Shell is taking some noteworthy steps in restructuring the business model, with plans to only have SIX refineries in its portfolio by 2025 all of which are integrated with chemicals, biofuels, lubricants, or provide strong footing for its trading business. It's trimming its upstream assets to only a handful of cost advantaged fields and is planning on using cash generation there to bolster investments in what it has clearly outlined as its growth sectors (IE renewables). RDS has taken a different approach compared to a lot of energy majors in that it is investing in what it views as intermediate fuels versus full on electric: LNG, Hydrogen, Biofuels, etc and its plan is to leverage its large retail arm to deliver these products efficiently to customers. I see this as a decent moat as these are sectors that are harder to break into versus electricity (everyone and their mother has invested in solar and wind farms lately). Shell is hosting a strategy day to outline its plans going forward in which it is expected to discuss its business streamlining and plans for renewables. It may be worth a watch. RDS has certainly taken a beating during COVID, as have all energy companies, but with Shell's unique portfolio and real steps towards preparing for the energy transition I wouldn't be surprised if it comes out as a very strong player over the next decade. It has plans to raise its dividend soon and has kept its balance sheet in nice tidy order through the stresses of COVID. Risks I see: Can energy majors shake off the stigma of being ""oil and gas"" companies and receive due attention for investors? Will advancements in electric vehicles be significant enough to leap frog intermediate renewable fuels? Will divesting significant portions of its traditional oil and gas business leave it more cash strapped than expected? What is the actual timeline for seeing significant returns on its renewable investments? What are your own thoughts on RDS? Or other oil majors making serious steps towards an energy transition?

Long haul sleepers run almost 24/4-6 days a week drivers switch out every 11hrs or so. Local trucks usually are shared between 2 drivers every day 10-12hr shifts each. (Speaking as a UPS driver)So could probably add another 80% on top of your estimate if they're used efficiently. Also we've used LNGs before and as a driver not a fan of them but they seemed to work fine and have decent power. Sucked fueling them off site at the one location near our building.

I'm still in somewhat because I agree with you about the energy transition play:The retail play - that network is huge and not cheap to enter into in a 3-5year time span. Even if they don't produce hydrogen I think they can still be distributors. Hydrogen may not be viable for passenger vehicles but I believe the thesis by NIO is correct: long haul trucking is more efficient being hydrogen based as opposed to traditional battery packs. Not invested in NIO because I don't believe they will be the ones to pull it off.They are picking up their renewables network in wind and transitioning to an utilities slowly for some time. Renewables economics today favour the utilities (LCOE for wind has been declining), not the producer (competition increasing). If they can convince the analyst community they will become a mini-NextEra that will shoot up valuation significantly.One thing that may play out either way: their oil reserves are among the lowest of the majors and decreasing [year on year] (https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1ZT1WQ). While normally it's a bad thing but as oil slowly declines only the lowest cost (the Saudi's) and strategic producers (US shale) will remain. This means reducing capex needs that can further accelerate their transition, but the flip side is they may run out of cash before that happens.In short, if the world takes 30 years to drastically move away from oil, Shell's dead (so will all of us actually). If it takes 10-15 to take out at least 50% of demand, this is a dividend paying 2-3 bagger.",0,0.534,NEGATIVE,0.979

Back in 2006-2008 BP rebranded themselves as ""Beyond Petroleum"" and marketed themselves as the leader of a new energy world, investing in renewables (in particular wind). By 2013 they sold off all their solar and wind assets and decided to refocus on oil and gas. The world just wasn't ready for it frankly. And BP didn't make very drastic changes to their company structure, they just sprinkled around a few million euros here, a few million euros there to see if anything stuck. It didn't, they just ended up with a bunch of disconnected, low margin wind and solar farms.Shell is definitely taking a different approach, putting their money where their mouth is by actually selling off O&G assets and reinvesting in renewable growth areas.

The thing is that the renewables industry doesn't have nearly as many barriers to entry as the petroleum industry and plenty of people have a lot fewer potentially stranded assets to keep them from moving quickly than RDS does.I'm ok with the idea of the oil majors as dividend plays, but even aside from my moral qualms I don't see them as long-term winners at all. Transportation fuels represent a disproportionate share of demand and that's going to be plateauing and then declining at an accelerating rate (as will natural gas peakers, followed by CCGTs).

There is the argument that as oil declines, wells are closed, and this by-product declines steeply in supply as the world is potentially looking to it for a transportation fuel.

There's a big emphasis on hydrogen, continued use of natural gas, and carbon capture sequestration (which they refer to as CCUS). They're even projecting oil as a significant chunk of primary energy come 2050 which I doubt since the economics get worse rapidly as transportation and heating use falls.Hydrogen has been hyped for literally decades, but has seen very little uptake since it's expensive (cost and energy-wise), complicated, and potentially dangerous due to it being highly reactive and stored under pressure. CCS has seen basically no real world successes, it hurts EROEI, and it's not even settled science that carbon will stay put underground. Natural gas isn't exactly profitable, battery storage is rapidly undermining its role and economics (basically no gas peaker plants are being built today), and without working CCS the economics of it and blue hydrogen both get crushed further.There are some other things I take issue with in it (projections for nuclear or biomass, the breadth of areas where even green hydrogen might compete, some solar and wind numbers), but the main gist of my complaint is the areas they see for themselves I mostly don't think will actually wind up being there for them.",2,0.516,NEGATIVE,1.0

In particular I agree with your assessment of the hydrogen situation, although there are some governments that are actively promoting it such as Japan and South Korea. The biggest advantage is ease of generation, its not too hard to make wherever you want to. Other than positive potential as a transportation fuel, the use of natural gas I see going forward is as power source, used primarily as a buffer to swings to renewable sources (like wind and solar). With a scattering of strategically placed natural gas cogens you can maintain a fairly constant stream of electricity without much need for high capacity batteries (and the large amounts of minerals required to produce them.)I'm curious with nuclear what you take issue with? I've been a big proponent of nuclear for years as a terrific electricity source, but the economics don't work very well. Natural gas is just too cheap and easy to make power with on a low footprint and basic kit. Nuclear plants are extremely expensive and complex for next to no margin with a big societal barrier to overcome.",3,0.52,POSITIVE,0.94

For general transportation it seems to be as or more expensive every step of the way compared to BEVs and BEVs appear on track to be feasible even for short-haul regional flights.Watch the numbers EIA releases for natural gas combustion turbine installed summer capacity. That's the canary in the gas mine I expect to keel over starting soon and combined cycle turbines should follow (5-15 yrs depending on regulatory environment). I don't think people appreciate how cheap batteries can get relative to the value of the services provided.Nuclear has very long lead times, a negative learning rate (they get more expensive the more are built), a slow generation ramp rate, and high O&M so I genuinely don't think any more will be starting construction in the U.S. Shell is projecting a significant amount of new builds to keep it a constant % of U.S. generation in 2050.",4,0.527,NEGATIVE,1.0

It has plans to raise its dividend soon and has kept its balance sheet in nice tidy order through the stresses of COVID. Risks I see: Can energy majors shake off the stigma of being ""oil and gas"" companies and receive due attention for investors? Will advancements in electric vehicles be significant enough to leap frog intermediate renewable fuels? Will divesting significant portions of its traditional oil and gas business leave it more cash strapped than expected? What is the actual timeline for seeing significant returns on its renewable investments? What are your own thoughts on RDS? Or other oil majors making serious steps towards an energy transition?
