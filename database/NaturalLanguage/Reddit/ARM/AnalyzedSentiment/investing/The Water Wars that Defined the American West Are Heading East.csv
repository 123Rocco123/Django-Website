,"CAMILLA, Ga.—Water stress, a hallmark of the American West, is spreading east. The shift is evident on Casey Cox’s family farm in Georgia’s agricultural heartland, where she turned on five giant rotating sprinklers to see her sweet corn through weeks of hot, dry weather last spring. “If we hadn’t had irrigation, our crop would have burned up completely,” said Ms. Cox, who with her father also produces soybeans, peanuts and timber on 2,400 acres. More water to save Ms. Cox’s crops, though, often means less for neighbors to the south such as Rickey Banks. He gave up his life as a Florida oysterman when his fishery, which depends on water from the same river basin as Ms. Cox’s farm, collapsed during a drought. Increasing competition for water is playing out across the Eastern U.S., a region more commonly associated with floods and hurricanes and one that was mostly a stranger, until recently, to the type of bitter interstate water dispute long seen in the West. Eastern farmers’ rising thirst for water, together with urban growth and climate change, now is taxing water supplies and fueling legal fights that pit states against each other. The shift has exposed the region to changes in water supply occurring globally as swelling populations, surging industrial demand and warmer temperatures turn a resource seen as a natural right into a contested one. In the U.S., burgeoning coastal populations have lowered water tables and dried up streams in Long Island, N.Y. Near Tampa, Fla., groundwater pumping has drawn saltwater into aquifers, drained lakes and triggered sinkholes. Decades of pumping by farmers and others have led to sharp declines in critical aquifers that flank the lower Mississippi River. “What keeps me awake at night is not western water issues—it’s the East,” said Lara Fowler, an attorney and professor of water law and policy at Pennsylvania State University... More states in the East are placing first-ever restrictions on permits for water use, said Barton “Buzz” Thompson, a professor of natural-resources law at Stanford University, who served as special master in a decadelong fight between Montana and Wyoming over Yellowstone River water. Some water experts say eastern states are still unprepared for scarcity, armed with a patchwork of regulations and laws that assume water will remain plentiful. Unlike in the West, where most major river basins are governed by interstate compacts, only a few such agreements exist in the East. I know the water theme has been sort of laughed at ever since The Big Short popularized it, but I do think it remains a long-term investment theme of interest, and one that is likely to grow more acute over time. This article deals primarily with farming and irrigation, but some great (IMO) relevant companies that I have picked up recently include: $ECL, $DHR, $AQUA, $WAAS, $XYL, $ROP. I haven't invested specifically in the utilities per se, but more so the businesses that help conserve or filter/purify water, and increase efficiency of use. What do you guys think? https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-water-wars-that-defined-the-american-west-are-heading-east-11575315318?mod=hp_featst_pos1","Cool post. Thanks. AWK is the only water utility I've invested in but it has done me well and I agree that there is a lot of upside potential to water utilities as we continue to suck our aquifers dry. But damn they're all super expensive right now.My current profession is a water resources bureaucrat, and from my position, however, the major overlooked water need is flood mitigation. Catastrophic flash floods and coastal flooding are increasing and will absolutely continue to increase. I'd like to invest in a company that focuses primarily on flood mitigation, but I haven't found one yet. Any recommendations?",0,0.533,POSITIVE,0.976
