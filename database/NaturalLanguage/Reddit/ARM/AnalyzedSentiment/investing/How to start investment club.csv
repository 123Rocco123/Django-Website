,"Hello, I'm not a frequent redditor, but reddit seems like the right place to ask this question. My question is: how can I start an investment fund at my high school, from a legal perspective? I know many high schools have these funds, but how do they operate (ex. license, personal account of teacher, etc.)? I have zero clue whatsoever as to how this would work. ANY tips would be super nice. About the prospective fund: -Initial funding would be about $1000-2000, from an alumni grant. Perhaps the small amount of capital would make the process easier? -I'm a high school freshman, and experienced day trader. Last week, I was able to double the balance of my MarketWatch virtual account (luck played a role in this though ;) ). Obviously, this will not be a day trading fund, but I know the mechanics of the market. -I made a few investments in January, and my stocks have slightly outperformed the S&P 500 (dividend-adjusted). At the moment, I'm much more confident in my abilities to pick stocks (but my Dad won't allow me to change my holdings -- in his words ""day trade""). -This would be an arm of the school's business club, which is already operating an on-campus business. At this point, I'm completely clueless about how I can actually establish a fund. Again, a few schools around my school have investment funds, I've heard, but I can't figure out how. If you guys would be so kind, I'd love a few pointers on how to establish such a fund. I have zero clue whatsoever, so any info would be much appreciated!","I'm a high school freshman, and experienced day trader....",0,0.576,POSITIVE,0.995

Step two contacting a few existing clubs and ask to copy their paperwork.There are many ways to structure. Because most will be under 18, it might make sense to structure as a nonprofit and funnel profits towards small gifts to the school or a trip. Actually reporting income can open up a lot of paperwork.",0,0.513,NEGATIVE,0.989

You'll have to take care of all the accounting of the money frow the ones that subscribe. In France there was also a minimum capital of about 1M required.It's probably different in US, supposedly easier, but you really shouldn't. As you become accountable for loosing other's money, and if you loose a lot, they might sue you and probably win the lawcase as you have no degree in finance. Plus if they are friends it's an easy way to loose said friends.What I ended up doing, and seems mose suitable for your situation, was a group a friends with regular meetings organized. The plan was to have one meeting per week on Saturday evening, each time bat someone else's place. In really 80% of the meetings ended up at my place. At each meeting we'd discuss stocks of interest, show the technical analysis we had made and explain why it would be a good stock to buy or short for the next week(s) or months. Giving suggestions about entry point, stop loss and take profit.After 2-3 meetings I realised something you will too, people of that age are very rarely well thought about markets. Some entered the club without a single prior knowledge, one of them I remember took hours to understand that no matter if the stock you buy is 5$ and you buy 20 of them, or it's 100$ and you buy one, if the stock does +5% you'll gain the same in those two situations. So those meetings where also a good place to share knowledge. What are stock, what are funds, what position size should you take, where to place stoploss, how to manage risk, building and keeping a trading journal.We were roughly 20 in the club but only 8-12 at each meeting. Two of the members came quite often even tough they never bought a single stock, hadn't even opened an account. In the end everybody could take what he wanted from the suggestions we made and invest according to his own system and capital. It was lots of fun. And less cumbersome to set up and maintain than what you're planning. Probably more suited to your scale.Maybe in 10-15 years when your members have all got a lot of experience, grown a nice capital you might consider forming an investment group with the most implicated ones and start a regulated hedge fund.",0,0.54,NEGATIVE,0.967

But hopefully I can teach some people, crush the markets, and gather some leadership experience. My school's extremely generous with its grants (humungous endowment and wealthy donors), so hopefully my club can get a bloomberg terminal sometime as well.It was helpful that you added that many people need a lot of explaining. I'll make sure not to underestimate the training stage. Ideally, I'll be able assign some sort of ""homework"" for kids to do outside of club meetings.I aspire to work in a hedge fund someday, so I'm just trying to live it right here, right now, with what I've got.",1,0.517,POSITIVE,0.993
