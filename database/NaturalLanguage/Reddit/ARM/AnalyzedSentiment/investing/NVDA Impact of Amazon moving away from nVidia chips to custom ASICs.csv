,"In a blog post for Amazon AWS yesterday, it seems Amazon has been developing their own ASICs (AWS Inferentia) to better power Alexa and their AI infrastructure, and the results seem pretty great - "" resulted in 25% lower end-to-end latency, and 30% lower cost compared to GPU-based instances for Alexa’s text-to-speech workloads."" Since they're currently using NVIDIA GPUs to power this part of their business, what do you think the long term impact would be for NVIDIA? I suspect since Amazon's Alexa / AI side of the business will continue to grow, cutting NVIDIA out of the picture would be a significant blow to them, and a boon for Amazon. But maybe this could have also been one of the reasons NVIDIA sought to buy Arm a couple months ago?","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

Losing AWS business (I assume NVIDIA did business with AWS?) can certainly hit NVIDIA bottom line, but since it seems like AWS won't mass produce and sell them to 3rd parties the damage is limited.Also AWS seems to rely on Intel, and Intel has had trouble with going 10nm and smaller with their hardware so in the long term it'll be interesting to see how it turns out for AWS.I find it interesting how so many companies seem to be doing their own custom AI chips. Google has them, NVIDIA has them, Apple made some, I assume AMD wants to make them too and now AWS joins the fray. Did I miss a company also doing them?So far many of the AI chips are custom made by companies for their own products and won't be on sale for everyone to buy. So that limits the competition NVIDIA faces.",0,0.556,NEGATIVE,1.0
