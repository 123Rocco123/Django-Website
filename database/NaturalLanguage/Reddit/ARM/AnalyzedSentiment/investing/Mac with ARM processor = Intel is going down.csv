,"I predict Intel stocks are going down in the coming months. They struggle for a long time with their own processors and when Apple finally uses ARM processors it would also be a huge signal for Microsoft to make the next step in the ARM direction. Intel will loose so much money one the way down, they don’t have the financial power to come up again in the ARM section.

Those 5 nm SOCs will need TSMC fabs.Intel's stock will take a hard hit but analysts could make a big deal about Apple increasing their China exposure too. Be careful.,0,0.527,NEGATIVE,1.0
