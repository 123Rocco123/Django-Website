,"So, I had some money in my Google Play account from filling out their surveys and got the ebook of this book because it's short and cheap, the name popped up a few times here and I got curious. In other books, I have read Random Walk Down Wall Street, and Margin of Safety. Initially, I was put off by the title, because it sounds like one of these scam books, where the true path to riches is to write books for suckers who want to get rich quick. Even worse, the investment approach described in the book is a magic formula. Can it get any more fishy? But wait. It's all not so bad. What this book advocates is basically a simplified, light version of Value Investing. The ideas behind value investing appear to be reasonably sound (Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffet...) but the process of properly evaluating a business to figure out its fair value is hard. The author thus offers a shortcut to value investing. Rather than sweating over all the minuscule details of 5 to 10 companies, screen for companies that are: Not tooooo small (>$50 mil market cap), then rank them via a combined measure of whether they are a cheap company (low P/E) and whether they are a good company, which he defines as having a high Return on Assets. Armed with that list, buy 30 or so stocks ranked this way and hold them for a year. On average, this process should give you a decent list of value stocks. The number 30 (as opposed to 5-10) is important because for every single company you don't know if their P/E is low because they just suck or if their return on assets is high because they had a huge one-time sell-off, so sometimes your ""value"" stock is just a ""shit"" stock. So far his method (obviously I describe it very crudely). He provides impressive backtested results avoiding, from what I can tell, the typical backtest traps. What I like about this approach: There is absolutely no forecasting involved. The valuation is done based on past data, so you don't have to guess (which you wouldn't do correctly anyway) what you think the company will earn 10 years from now. What I dislike is its willful blindness of the type of company. I figure that his formula can be a good starting point to identify companies worthy of a closer look, but feel that one should always put in some work to avoid value traps. One example: Gilead is high up on the list as it currently would be generated. But r/stockaday did an awesome analysis on that one and made a good case for being at least a little bit cautious. I'd love to hear what the more knowledgeable folks in this subreddit think about this book, and about the method, at least as a starting point on the search for value investing opportunities.","Alright, so I think there are some misconceptions about the book that you've picked up. I'll try to dispel those.First, I don't think you're giving the author, Joel Greenblatt, enough credit. Joel is one of the most successful modern value investors and returned 50% compounded between 1985 - 1995 when he was picking individual special situation stocks. If you would like one of his more ""in the weeds"" books, try You Can Be a Stock Market Genius.Second, this magic formula approach is not supposed to be a short cut to value investing, but instead is a quantitative method for retail investors who want to be in the market but don't have enough time to research individual stocks. He suggests buying a basket of them (30-50) so that even if you're wrong on a few you'll still be ok. This is not different, at all, from Ben Graham telling people to buy net-nets by the basket full because its likely some of them will be wrong, too.Also, he suggests you buy companies with high earnings yield and high returns on invested capital, not ROA.If it seems like there is a willful blindness to the companies you're picking its because its designed to be that way. If you have time to research individual companies then this approach is not for you. Its for those who don't have enough time to do that.Also, if you think his back test examples are typical back test traps then I direct you to his new firm's website - Gotham Funds. These funds run the magic formula approach and you can see their performance.",0,0.539,NEGATIVE,1.0

Another person thought they'd buy McDonalds now, then sell at the height of the Monopoly promotion.I think the picture changes a bit when you use a bit more thought in deciding how past earnings relate to future earnings.
