,"Companies like Teledoc ($TDOC) are making it easier for doctors to communicate with patients via video chat. CVS is rolling out similar services as a part of its Minute Clinic arm. Regulation/legislation seems to be allowing these companies to obtain licenses for providing these telehealth services. If doctors spend more time treating patients digitally, resulting in patients spending less time in physical doctor's offices, won't the underlying business models of many healthcare REITs (see below) be in danger? WELL NHI DOC HR HCP SNH VTR HTA","It’s an interesting concept and I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s fairly common in the future but the biggest roadblock for these companies is achieving profitability and finding a level playing field that’s fairly stable across the country. Healthcare, insurance, and medical billing in the US is extremely complicated and varies state from state. Either the companies themselves or the US as a whole will have to figure something out with dealing with these companies as a large amount of their money and most profitable bases comes from within the US. The waters get murky when you have a patient in say California getting treatment from a doctor in Texas for a company based out of New York.The good news is I do think the public, companies, and in general the government would like to see the success of these companies. We’ve seen more and more people be willing to use the business and the number of employers offering it has grown as well. If it can increase efficiency and lower costs, I don’t see why the government wouldn’t be for it when healthcare is one of the biggest costs for society.In regards to profitability, I believe Teledoc is struggling in this sense and has possibly seen a regression with it. It’s been awhile since I looked over the data but I don’t think the company was profitable and was taking on larger losses despite growing. It may not be fair to expect profitability right now but you don’t want to be trending downwards if you’re growing. Again, it’s been awhile since I’ve researched them but I believe this was a big issue with them.",0,0.537,NEGATIVE,0.995
