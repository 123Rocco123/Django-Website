,"Hey guys, I'm relatively new to investing and quite young, and after a fair amount of research, I would love to hear your thoughts on a few stocks I've been eyeing for my portfolio. I am looking to create a portfolio that I won't touch for at least 5 years (besides the last stock I list here, which looks intriguing). I plan to invest a relatively small amount (only three to five thousand) as I am only 20, and that is already the lion share of my funds. So without further ado: T ----- bought a good chunk of shares (~34) when it was at its lowest during the pandemic. The dividend plus potential from 5G looked especially interesting to me. I'm pretty comfortable holding on to it, especially at the price I got it, but I am curious as to what you think of AT & T's potential for the next 5 years. NKE ----- Seems like Nike is really taking control over their products and brand name, closing a bunch of high profile accounts with 3rd party vendors. This new strategy seems interesting and I think it is particularly telling that many experts (i.e. Barrons) almost unanimously list it as a buy even though the stock went up $10 dollars a share this week alone. ABBV ---- Seems like a solid stock with a fair amount of potential products coming out in 2021. Plus, they have a hefty dividend (they're a dividend aristocrat) and have the best selling drug in the world, Humira. NVDA ----- Incredibly solid company with ridiculous annual growth over the past few years. Regardless of whether the ARMS acquisition happens, it seems like a real champion in a very lucrative field (semiconductors). MSGE ---- this one is purely speculative. It seems like New York City is shutting down again, which I imagine will be detrimental to MSGE (which owns Madison Square Garden and other entertainment complexes). If played right seems like it could be bought for a bargain with potentially very high rewards by even the summertime or next year.","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

If you’re new to investing, I would go no less than 80% of your holdings in ETFs or mutual funds, and no more than 20% in individual companies.As far as T, I think Verizon is a better business. The dividend is lower, but I still think it’s a better buy. Unfortunately T is weighed down significantly by its legacy revenue streams.I don’t invest in clothing/fashion brands because I don’t understand them, but Nike is probably the “best in breed” when it comes to that sort of thing.Abbvie is a great company. Just be aware their patent on Humira will be expiring soon. They’ll need to see success from their pipeline to make up for it.I like Nvidia. It’s expensive as hell, but I don’t think you’d regret buying it and holding for 5-10 years.",0,0.54,NEGATIVE,1.0

Their deal with Apple is already priced into the stock. If you do your own analysis and decide that their future growth rate justifies the share price, then I don’t see why not.",2,0.578,NEGATIVE,0.981

Future Growth + Good Value are the key metrics to look for when you’re picking stocks. At your age, time is your best friend.

T may be a value trap, hard to tell, and ABBV's recent success will be winding down as patents expire so it's all about that pipeline (I own a little for the divy as well). I think at 20 you should have at least one pick that is speculative, something of your generation that you think could really blow up.I was 20 when Google went public and despite that I lived half of my life every day on their products seeing their ads, I listened to too many people telling me to invest in more established businesses, with Peter Lynch principles. Not bad for most of my portfolio, but I know that you know something we olds don't, now.",0,0.515,NEGATIVE,0.999

I know they do other stuff as well, but something as high profile as that really has the potential to leave a bad taste in a lot of potential enterprise customers' mouths.",0,0.526,NEGATIVE,0.999
