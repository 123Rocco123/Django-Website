,"So, I was reading an FT article named ' Fears for London market after SoftBank's Arm and building group CRH opt for New York' and it said at the beggining that one of the reasons was the higher valuation the US gives to tech stocks. My question is, in this day and age, does the place of listing matter that much? As a retail investor I can buy stocks from all the big stock markets, so I guess other more powerful investors can do it even more easily. Shouldn't people look at stocks to invest as the company itself, and not where it is listed, and thus make the place of listing irrelevant?","It matters and especially for the index. Indexes are companies themselves + imagine all the people buying GBP to get ARM. Some stocks have 100 bil valuation. It's like an airport hub. If fewer companies use it, at some point links breaks and people stop visiting altogether.For the individual also. Americans can't easily invest outside of the US. For me a Europea I'd rather not buy in GBP. Also, the size of the market means you will likely get more for your IPO like you said. + stock based comp for execs is higher",0,0.557,POSITIVE,0.819

But how many people dont do it that way? how many funds aim to mirror the S&P 500, for instance?Orhow many 401k’s offer a “foreign” and a “domestic” index?Both those scenarios would absolutely be affected by the exchange used.",0,0.521,NEGATIVE,0.996
