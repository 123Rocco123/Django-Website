,"Just wondering out loud to those of you who may know better. Given that there's lots of anti-competitive oversight on tech giants like Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Google, they can't just acquire companies left, right, and centre as they did before. Do you think that they will lean on investing in high growth companies to drive future growth? Most of them have a VC subsidiary as it is (ie Google Ventures, M12) and I was thinking that it could expand to invest in listed small to mid cap companies with more liquidity. Like a Berkshire-ish set-up. I understand that Tencent actually leverages their insights as to things to invest in, to an extent, based on user behaviour and searches on its platform. Similarly, I can imagine Google doing the same with it's data across it's search platform etc.","Their future growth will come from digital transformation in developing countries. Here's a good article from Microsoft: Running the digital transformation marathon in emerging marketsAnd that means, that unlike early tech-adopter economies in the developed world, emerging markets do not have to wrestle with the complications of legacy IT systems. The very fact that they were unwired backwaters in the recent past makes them digital clean slates for the future. This promises to be an exciting advantage. “They can advance much faster and even leapfrog developed countries,” says Michelle.This paper-to-cloud transformation is already reaping massive benefits and revealing new opportunities and empowerment across various economic and social sectors.When you look at the world, there are two billion people who are unbanked globally – and about 450 million in Southeast Asia alone. Technology is changing that. People, who perhaps had to travel tens of kilometers in order to get to a bank, can now have access to banking services through their mobile phones, through technology,” she says. “That’s changing people’s lives in these emerging markets. They can set up a business. They can be a part of the formal economy … and it’s enabling governments to have more productive societies so that their countries can advance.”",0,0.541,POSITIVE,0.989

It’s probably short sighted of me however will this provide the exponential gain due to affordability and infrastructure limitations?From what I understand, the leapfrogging was to a mobile first environment to which a company like Meta is heavily involved in through WhatsApp.",1,0.551,NEGATIVE,0.552
