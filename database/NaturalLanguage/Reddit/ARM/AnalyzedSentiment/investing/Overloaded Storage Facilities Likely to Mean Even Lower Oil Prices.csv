,"More bad news for the energy sector and many marginal oil producers, places to store oil are starting to run out, and Saudi and Russian oil production only starting to ratchet up: https://www.wsj.com/articles/overloaded-storage-facilities-likely-to-mean-even-lower-oil-prices-11584548816 Storage facilities around the world are brimming with cheap oil and could run out of space within months, traders and analysts say, a predicament that could drive down crude prices to unprecedented single-digit dollar amounts. As the global response to the coronavirus pandemic saps oil consumption with factory closures and travel restrictions, the Saudi-Russian price war has caused crude prices to plummet by half to around $28 a barrel this month. A flood of oil from Saudi Arabia and rival producers is expected to enter the market next month, adding to a surplus of oil that could overwhelm global storage. As markets struggle to find places to stockpile excess crude, “the prospect of single-figure prices…is now pretty inevitable in the coming months,” London-based consultancy FGE Energy said in a recent note. The big wave of extra crude will hit Western economies just at a time when they are likely to feel the full force of the coronavirus outbreak, creating a surplus as large as 10 million barrels of oil per day in the April-June period, said Warren Russell, commodities strategist at Bank of America. That means oil inventories could climb by more than 900 million barrels in the three months beginning April. As a result, “oil prices might have to trade down into the teens in order to shut in oil production,” Mr. Russell said. The fight for market share will make oil markets the most-oversupplied in over 30 years, said Norwegian bank DNB in a recent note. Even before the Saudi-Russian price war began, oil buyers had been warehousing large amounts of fuel on the high seas. With rising supplies combining with declining demand, global oil storage could fill up within four months, said Antoine Halff, the chief analyst of Paris-based consultancy Kayrros, which tracks global storage by using satellite imaging. “It’s a chess game played with a timer and each player has a very short time slot to make his moves,” he said. The mounting glut means the Saudis and others will have to keep cutting oil prices, industry watchers say. In Northwest Europe, for instance, where Aramco cut its main prices for April orders by the most, the combination of higher shipping costs and lower Brent means the Saudis would have to cut their prices by at least $5.50 if they want to remain competitive with others selling into the region. The Saudi decision to pump to the fullest amid collapsing demand is a “kamikaze” strategy, said an official from one of the countries in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. https://www.ft.com/content/546f14dc-6847-11ea-800d-da70cff6e4d3 The world could run out of oil storage capacity within months, according to the biggest energy traders, as the coronavirus pandemic crushes demand for fuel at the same time as the Saudi-Russia price war boosts supplies. Traders are predicting oil demand could fall at the fastest pace on record, as entire industrialised countries go into lockdown and major cities such as London and New York take drastic measures to try to slow the spread of the virus. For those renting out storage tanks or snapping up cheap oil with an eye on selling it at a profit later, this is a gift. But the oil industry’s capacity for storage is likely to be tested like never before, and prices may have to fall further to force the closure of oilfields. “Something will have to give,” said Torbjorn Tornqvist, chief executive of Gunvor. “The world is producing too much oil.” At the same time, supply from Saudi Arabia is expected to jump by about a quarter, with Russia and the UAE also increasing output, amid a battle for market share stemming in part over disagreements over how to respond to the crisis. In total that could take the surplus to at least 8m barrels per day. For traders such as Vitol, Glencore and Trafigura and the dealing arms of the oil majors, it could be a recipe for bumper paydays. In the last oil crash between late 2014 and 2016, the largest traders spun billion-dollar profits through so-called contango trades. Traders with access to capital and storage can buy cheap barrels in the spot market and lock in an almost guaranteed profit by selling them forward in futures markets, as oversupply pushes short-term contracts to a large discount to later-dated ones. Two weeks ago Glencore hired one of the world’s largest oil tankers, an Ultra Large Crude Carrier — one of only two remaining in the world — which is capable of storing 3m barrels of crude. Normal supertankers hold about 2m. One concern for traders looking beyond onshore storage may be that using supertankers to float oil offshore may be more difficult this time. Saudi Arabia’s determination to flood the market in an attempt to hurt weaker rivals has caused tanker rates to soar, as the kingdom scrambles to charter ships to get the additional oil to market. That skews the economics of the trade. But oil prices are moving in a direction that could make it feasible, with the spot price of Brent crude falling faster than longer-dated contracts. The 12-month spread has widened to almost $11 a barrel, from 38 cents at the start of the month. Mr Serio at Vitol said that on the current trajectory even sea-based storage could eventually become maxed out. “We are not there yet but we are not going to have any space onshore and it will be hard to find any storage on water,” Mr Serio said. “Therefore, the price will have to fall to motivate someone to cut production.”",Same way they did in 2016 when Oil went below $30 a barrel.
