By those metrics, you are a bit behind.How much income do you think youâ€™ll need when you retire? The $1.5M you currently have, will only support about $40k/year of income. If that+SS + whatever you might have wonâ€™t support the income you want in retirement, youâ€™ll need to figure out a way to save more.",0,0.527,NEGATIVE,0.936

What about a reserve for catastrophic health care? What if youâ€™re unable to work at any point in the next five years?You should strongly consider downsizing your home now and putting the extra money to work for youâ€¦now. And reducing spending now would be a good idea too. You either recently started making a high salary, or you have not saved enough for many years.In other words, while you may not be cooked, your total amount of savings is a mismatch with your salary, given your age.You can invest what youâ€™ve got in a S&P 500 ETF plus either some type of bond ETF and short term treasuries. I wouldnâ€™t hold more than five tickers. Keep it simple. But overall your issue is the size of your portfolio.",1,0.519,NEGATIVE,0.995

By the time someone reaches their 60â€™s most of them are concerned about wealth preservation and their portfolios contain 60% equities and 40% bonds. With bonds at 40% and higher (as you age), the bonds will put a drag on your investment returns. The recommendation is to withdraw no more than 4% from your investments in retirement.What will you do if we experience a downturn in the market, early in your retirement years? My primary retirement account was invested aggressively and took a 40% hit in 2022. I retired in late 2019, but since I live below my means on some passive income, I didnâ€™t touch that account. It finally recovered in early 2024.",1,0.515,NEGATIVE,1.0

Read 4% take out is appropriate in retirement My sal has been for 4 years in that range of $250k, before that around $200. My biggest worry is healthcare expenses. I overlooked and didnâ€™t take long term health care policy. Yes didnâ€™t invest properly, wish I can rewind ðŸ˜€. My lifestyle isnâ€™t expensive. Agree on downsizing. NJ taxes kill.

But, one doesnâ€™t know if what the future will bring, especially if the market tanks. You really donâ€™t want to be forced to sell stocks, etc. when the market is down. One other thing to keep in mind is that when you take distributions from your 401k, youâ€™ll be taxed at your ordinary income tax rate.Since you donâ€™t have any debt other than your mortgage, can you bump up your investments/savings before you retire?",3,0.53,NEGATIVE,0.922
