,"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/169gq22/tsm_a_technical_play_on_chips_ai/ i made this post in this sub a long time ago, and while my stop losses were broken (i actually didnt use those stop losses i was just trying to give a reasonable play) the stock did do what i thought it would. TSM went down, it made a low that was still a bit higher than its prior low, then it continued in the uptrend and made a new high. 115. i think theres still value here. you get a pull back, especially anything south of 100 dollars, i think you could see 145 again on this stock easily over the next year if semiconductor sales stay good, which they likely will. semiconductors are the new oil. tech is not stopping. tech runs off data and computing. data and computing are done by chips. chips need semiconductors. diversify into ASML (i buy FEZ on RH to get diversified exposure, which is inefficient.) buy the other foundrys INTL and SAMSUNG (I buy EWY on RH to get exposure). find a packaging company, i buy AMKR because they do packaging and testing. Buy other design if you want - amd, i dont. Buy NVDA if you want, i dont i own it through indexes (spy on RH spx would be better otherwise) and etfs (VOOG). buy the coding languages ARM or some alternative. Buy the entire supply chain. But TSM under 100, 100% under 95, and 1000% under 90 or 85 is a buy always, fuck china. China a bitch. Invade this dick. my cost avg is 79.90",Of course there is more value in TSM. $550B market cap is being held down due to the china threat over the past decade. It will continue to be repressed until poobear either dies or declares Taiwan a free country which will never. Ever. Happen.,0,0.519,NEGATIVE,0.995
