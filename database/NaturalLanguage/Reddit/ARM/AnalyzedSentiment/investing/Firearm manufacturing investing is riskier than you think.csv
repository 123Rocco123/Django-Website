,"What you probably think of gun maker stocks is they're priced as industrials but with a lot of regulatory risks. That's all true, but you'd also be surprised just how many of these companies go bankrupt. Most larger brands that you would have heard have had filed for bankruptcy at some point, some pretty recently, and other companies have gone bankrupt during wartime when you'd think their business model is unsinkable. Especially with smaller firms, because the sheer volume of independent machinists that have come and gone over the years can boggle the mind. It always comes down to at least one of very simple reasons: People simply weren't buying the guns. A large portion of sales were supposed to go to a single customer (usually a government). The weapon was far too niche and there simply wasn't as much market for it as they thought. Weapons sales are strongly correlated to fear. When people fear other people, they buy weapons, meaning demand for weapons of different types varies by as much as 100% in a given year. Didn't have money for requisite equipment. Specialized custom machines needed (lathes, forges, milling robot, rivet machine, etc). Many weapons may sit in storage for years before being sold while workers need salaries and rent needs paid. Manufacturing less profitable than anticipated. Quality control entails frequent re-milling of parts and labor costs ensue. Competition with other manufacturers drives down prices. The first reason is by far the most common. Recall that weapons are not consumer products and any decently made gun will outlive the owner. Also, they aren't cheap, and the user needs to balance getting a nice gun with what is within their budget. It's possible to spend ten grand on a handgun, and to be fair those guns have awesome precision, but the ordinary man who just needs a burglar gun might opt for an old west style revolver because they're cheap and super reliable. This highlights another major point because weapons sales can be a fat-margin high-risk business, and it can be a narrow-margin low-risk business often with no actual changes to the weapons themselves. In any case, it's a business that heavily favors economies of scale but that is often impossible because what the customer needs isn't standard. I personally own a gun that I had custom assembled from Sig Sauer because I couldn't find anything on the market that had all the things I wanted. Also, since this is a defense industry all countries, often really tiny ones, want indigenous production to the point that state-sponsored patent violations have occurred throughout history. Often key parts of the manufacturing process are nationalized, meaning some overtly unprofitable factories are propped up artificially for decades. For instance, the Mexican Federales use to buy guns from H&K but decided they wanted to make their own but were too cheap to design their own. So they took the rifle they had in service and changed enough of the internals to circumvent patent laws and had uniformed soldiers assemble the guns. High-risk startup behavior is far more common with arms than other heavy manufacturing. In one case during World War One, a group of 8 machinists got together and decided they'd make guns but they took all the contracts they could thinking they could just use the contracts as collateral for loans to set up a factory (of course governments only gave them said contracts because they neglected to mention they had no factory). Needless to say, they didn't get enough money together for the factory and the scheme fell through. In another case in the 1950's some machinists made a new invention of a gun that could fire several different cartridges, and this was a very atomic-age gun with everything made of streamlined aluminum. Of course, costs proved higher than anticipated and sales lower than anticipated and even the chosen name of gun Wolverine proved a problem since that name was already taken. This story wasn't all sad as these guys actually kept their people working while the boss worked on finding them new jobs and sold the guns over the years following the shop's closure. This highlights another point is that you should be more than a little skeptical when looking at small arms technology because it's never nearly as revolutionary as you think. Usually it's just a gimmick that may fill some niche but has no chance of going mainstream. For instance, Ammo Inc makes precision rounds, tracer rounds, and quiet rounds which all sounds nice if you're a US Army sniper but how big is that market? Probably not as big as you think, and its size and composition would vary year to year as army needs and budgets change. To be fair, it is possible for an independent gunsmith to have prodigious success. One British guy and his family would make custom sniper rifles for Olympic competitive marksmen and they heard the British army announce a competition for a new sniper rifle. They entered their rifle just so they could say they did it, but to their surprise the British army snipers decided they wanted the Olympic rifle to be standard issue. That set these guys scrambling to make enough guns to start making deliveries whilst contracting a machine shop to help which was more problematic than it sounds since the machine shop kept taking shortcuts. However, Remington Arms, which is among the oldest and most standard gun makers in the world, filed for bankruptcy twice in the last decade. They filed for bankruptcy in the middle of the Covid Panic when sales were prodigiously high. Of course, the reason was more long-term because they owed a lot of people money and didn't have the money coming in regularly. Now I told you that so you'd understand this: Gunsmiths are really bad businessmen. The men who want to be gunsmiths are really interested in producing bad*** weapons and are often divorced from what the average user wants or needs. The position is analogous to the legendary sword makers you see in Saxon and Norse sagas where the character is always a retired war veteran that crafts the finest tools of war for the noble hero. You understand, there's often ego involved in this. Samuel Colt himself was known to fire people for suggesting changes to his way of making the guns, and Colt would file for bankruptcy twice in his lifetime. When I bought a suppressor the company I bought it from insisted on helping with all the ATF paperwork which just made things even more complicated than they already were. I read elsewhere that these guys were so paranoid about mistakes that the firm had abnormally high turnover. The suppressor I got was nice, though. To be fair, the guns that often make business sense are generally derided by all the men that know anything about guns. Case in point: Hi-Point guns are notoriously heavy and un-ergonomic but are accurate, reliable, and cheap. They did this by minimizing the number of parts that needed to be milled or had tight tolerance so they could use stamped sheet metal and plastic for most of the parts. This makes for a gun that nobody likes, but people buy anyway because it's really good at doing what guns do best: Sit in a drawer for decades just in case the owner has to deal with an ***hole someday. In all good conscience, one cannot recommend any more than a market cap weighting of your investments to small arms manufacturers, which are less than 1% of the total market.",As a manufacturer of forged upper and lower receivers I can tell you these companies come and go so quickly.

Because reading this reddit, she'd some light on the risk. I'm still determined to do it, but if I could figure out a less risky approach to the industry, it would be great. I also wanted to point out that he mentioned that gunsmiths aren't good businessmen. I can totally believe that, on the other hand, I have started 2 companies that made 300k plus easily, and that was me working on it part-time. I also have several close family members like my dad, my uncle, and my aunt, who all have successful mulit million dollar businesses right now and have since I was a kid. I'm not saying this makes me fool proof nothing does, but the problem of the bad business isn't my problem. I'm very flexible on what part of the industry I'm willing to take on. Thank you for your comment. I will add those 2 companies to my list of material suppliers.",3,0.555,POSITIVE,0.578
,"What you probably think of gun maker stocks is they're priced as industrials but with a lot of regulatory risks. That's all true, but you'd also be surprised just how many of these companies go bankrupt. Most larger brands that you would have heard have had filed for bankruptcy at some point, some pretty recently, and other companies have gone bankrupt during wartime when you'd think their business model is unsinkable. Especially with smaller firms, because the sheer volume of independent machinists that have come and gone over the years can boggle the mind. It always comes down to at least one of very simple reasons: People simply weren't buying the guns. A large portion of sales were supposed to go to a single customer (usually a government). The weapon was far too niche and there simply wasn't as much market for it as they thought. Weapons sales are strongly correlated to fear. When people fear other people, they buy weapons, meaning demand for weapons of different types varies by as much as 100% in a given year. Didn't have money for requisite equipment. Specialized custom machines needed (lathes, forges, milling robot, rivet machine, etc). Many weapons may sit in storage for years before being sold while workers need salaries and rent needs paid. Manufacturing less profitable than anticipated. Quality control entails frequent re-milling of parts and labor costs ensue. Competition with other manufacturers drives down prices. The first reason is by far the most common. Recall that weapons are not consumer products and any decently made gun will outlive the owner. Also, they aren't cheap, and the user needs to balance getting a nice gun with what is within their budget. It's possible to spend ten grand on a handgun, and to be fair those guns have awesome precision, but the ordinary man who just needs a burglar gun might opt for an old west style revolver because they're cheap and super reliable. This highlights another major point because weapons sales can be a fat-margin high-risk business, and it can be a narrow-margin low-risk business often with no actual changes to the weapons themselves. In any case, it's a business that heavily favors economies of scale but that is often impossible because what the customer needs isn't standard. I personally own a gun that I had custom assembled from Sig Sauer because I couldn't find anything on the market that had all the things I wanted. Also, since this is a defense industry all countries, often really tiny ones, want indigenous production to the point that state-sponsored patent violations have occurred throughout history. Often key parts of the manufacturing process are nationalized, meaning some overtly unprofitable factories are propped up artificially for decades. For instance, the Mexican Federales use to buy guns from H&K but decided they wanted to make their own but were too cheap to design their own. So they took the rifle they had in service and changed enough of the internals to circumvent patent laws and had uniformed soldiers assemble the guns. High-risk startup behavior is far more common with arms than other heavy manufacturing. In one case during World War One, a group of 8 machinists got together and decided they'd make guns but they took all the contracts they could thinking they could just use the contracts as collateral for loans to set up a factory (of course governments only gave them said contracts because they neglected to mention they had no factory). Needless to say, they didn't get enough money together for the factory and the scheme fell through. In another case in the 1950's some machinists made a new invention of a gun that could fire several different cartridges, and this was a very atomic-age gun with everything made of streamlined aluminum. Of course, costs proved higher than anticipated and sales lower than anticipated and even the chosen name of gun Wolverine proved a problem since that name was already taken. This story wasn't all sad as these guys actually kept their people working while the boss worked on finding them new jobs and sold the guns over the years following the shop's closure. This highlights another point is that you should be more than a little skeptical when looking at small arms technology because it's never nearly as revolutionary as you think. Usually it's just a gimmick that may fill some niche but has no chance of going mainstream. For instance, Ammo Inc makes precision rounds, tracer rounds, and quiet rounds which all sounds nice if you're a US Army sniper but how big is that market? Probably not as big as you think, and its size and composition would vary year to year as army needs and budgets change. To be fair, it is possible for an independent gunsmith to have prodigious success. One British guy and his family would make custom sniper rifles for Olympic competitive marksmen and they heard the British army announce a competition for a new sniper rifle. They entered their rifle just so they could say they did it, but to their surprise the British army snipers decided they wanted the Olympic rifle to be standard issue. That set these guys scrambling to make enough guns to start making deliveries whilst contracting a machine shop to help which was more problematic than it sounds since the machine shop kept taking shortcuts. However, Remington Arms, which is among the oldest and most standard gun makers in the world, filed for bankruptcy twice in the last decade. They filed for bankruptcy in the middle of the Covid Panic when sales were prodigiously high. Of course, the reason was more long-term because they owed a lot of people money and didn't have the money coming in regularly. Now I told you that so you'd understand this: Gunsmiths are really bad businessmen. The men who want to be gunsmiths are really interested in producing bad*** weapons and are often divorced from what the average user wants or needs. The position is analogous to the legendary sword makers you see in Saxon and Norse sagas where the character is always a retired war veteran that crafts the finest tools of war for the noble hero. You understand, there's often ego involved in this. Samuel Colt himself was known to fire people for suggesting changes to his way of making the guns, and Colt would file for bankruptcy twice in his lifetime. When I bought a suppressor the company I bought it from insisted on helping with all the ATF paperwork which just made things even more complicated than they already were. I read elsewhere that these guys were so paranoid about mistakes that the firm had abnormally high turnover. The suppressor I got was nice, though. To be fair, the guns that often make business sense are generally derided by all the men that know anything about guns. Case in point: Hi-Point guns are notoriously heavy and un-ergonomic but are accurate, reliable, and cheap. They did this by minimizing the number of parts that needed to be milled or had tight tolerance so they could use stamped sheet metal and plastic for most of the parts. This makes for a gun that nobody likes, but people buy anyway because it's really good at doing what guns do best: Sit in a drawer for decades just in case the owner has to deal with an ***hole someday. In all good conscience, one cannot recommend any more than a market cap weighting of your investments to small arms manufacturers, which are less than 1% of the total market.",The two biggest risks I can point to are cyclical market conditions and part quality.

,"What you probably think of gun maker stocks is they're priced as industrials but with a lot of regulatory risks. That's all true, but you'd also be surprised just how many of these companies go bankrupt. Most larger brands that you would have heard have had filed for bankruptcy at some point, some pretty recently, and other companies have gone bankrupt during wartime when you'd think their business model is unsinkable. Especially with smaller firms, because the sheer volume of independent machinists that have come and gone over the years can boggle the mind. It always comes down to at least one of very simple reasons: People simply weren't buying the guns. A large portion of sales were supposed to go to a single customer (usually a government). The weapon was far too niche and there simply wasn't as much market for it as they thought. Weapons sales are strongly correlated to fear. When people fear other people, they buy weapons, meaning demand for weapons of different types varies by as much as 100% in a given year. Didn't have money for requisite equipment. Specialized custom machines needed (lathes, forges, milling robot, rivet machine, etc). Many weapons may sit in storage for years before being sold while workers need salaries and rent needs paid. Manufacturing less profitable than anticipated. Quality control entails frequent re-milling of parts and labor costs ensue. Competition with other manufacturers drives down prices. The first reason is by far the most common. Recall that weapons are not consumer products and any decently made gun will outlive the owner. Also, they aren't cheap, and the user needs to balance getting a nice gun with what is within their budget. It's possible to spend ten grand on a handgun, and to be fair those guns have awesome precision, but the ordinary man who just needs a burglar gun might opt for an old west style revolver because they're cheap and super reliable. This highlights another major point because weapons sales can be a fat-margin high-risk business, and it can be a narrow-margin low-risk business often with no actual changes to the weapons themselves. In any case, it's a business that heavily favors economies of scale but that is often impossible because what the customer needs isn't standard. I personally own a gun that I had custom assembled from Sig Sauer because I couldn't find anything on the market that had all the things I wanted. Also, since this is a defense industry all countries, often really tiny ones, want indigenous production to the point that state-sponsored patent violations have occurred throughout history. Often key parts of the manufacturing process are nationalized, meaning some overtly unprofitable factories are propped up artificially for decades. For instance, the Mexican Federales use to buy guns from H&K but decided they wanted to make their own but were too cheap to design their own. So they took the rifle they had in service and changed enough of the internals to circumvent patent laws and had uniformed soldiers assemble the guns. High-risk startup behavior is far more common with arms than other heavy manufacturing. In one case during World War One, a group of 8 machinists got together and decided they'd make guns but they took all the contracts they could thinking they could just use the contracts as collateral for loans to set up a factory (of course governments only gave them said contracts because they neglected to mention they had no factory). Needless to say, they didn't get enough money together for the factory and the scheme fell through. In another case in the 1950's some machinists made a new invention of a gun that could fire several different cartridges, and this was a very atomic-age gun with everything made of streamlined aluminum. Of course, costs proved higher than anticipated and sales lower than anticipated and even the chosen name of gun Wolverine proved a problem since that name was already taken. This story wasn't all sad as these guys actually kept their people working while the boss worked on finding them new jobs and sold the guns over the years following the shop's closure. This highlights another point is that you should be more than a little skeptical when looking at small arms technology because it's never nearly as revolutionary as you think. Usually it's just a gimmick that may fill some niche but has no chance of going mainstream. For instance, Ammo Inc makes precision rounds, tracer rounds, and quiet rounds which all sounds nice if you're a US Army sniper but how big is that market? Probably not as big as you think, and its size and composition would vary year to year as army needs and budgets change. To be fair, it is possible for an independent gunsmith to have prodigious success. One British guy and his family would make custom sniper rifles for Olympic competitive marksmen and they heard the British army announce a competition for a new sniper rifle. They entered their rifle just so they could say they did it, but to their surprise the British army snipers decided they wanted the Olympic rifle to be standard issue. That set these guys scrambling to make enough guns to start making deliveries whilst contracting a machine shop to help which was more problematic than it sounds since the machine shop kept taking shortcuts. However, Remington Arms, which is among the oldest and most standard gun makers in the world, filed for bankruptcy twice in the last decade. They filed for bankruptcy in the middle of the Covid Panic when sales were prodigiously high. Of course, the reason was more long-term because they owed a lot of people money and didn't have the money coming in regularly. Now I told you that so you'd understand this: Gunsmiths are really bad businessmen. The men who want to be gunsmiths are really interested in producing bad*** weapons and are often divorced from what the average user wants or needs.

Firearm manufacturers as an investment have never appealed to me for many of the reasons cited above.Some additional considerations / random facts… The market for firearms are quite saturated with many manufacturers to choose from. However, there is strong brand loyalty in the civilian market (predominantly US), which drives consistent sales to the big manufacturers like Glock, Sig, H&K, S&W… the majority of guns sold to the civilian market are sold to those who already owned one or more firearms. That said, 40% of gun sales in the US in 2020 were to first time gun buyers. 30% in 2021. Many of those first time buyers will be return buyers.",0,0.558,POSITIVE,0.632

They filed for bankruptcy in the middle of the Covid Panic when sales were prodigiously high. Of course, the reason was more long-term because they owed a lot of people money and didn't have the money coming in regularly. Now I told you that so you'd understand this: Gunsmiths are really bad businessmen. The men who want to be gunsmiths are really interested in producing bad*** weapons and are often divorced from what the average user wants or needs. The position is analogous to the legendary sword makers you see in Saxon and Norse sagas where the character is always a retired war veteran that crafts the finest tools of war for the noble hero. You understand, there's often ego involved in this. Samuel Colt himself was known to fire people for suggesting changes to his way of making the guns, and Colt would file for bankruptcy twice in his lifetime. When I bought a suppressor the company I bought it from insisted on helping with all the ATF paperwork which just made things even more complicated than they already were. I read elsewhere that these guys were so paranoid about mistakes that the firm had abnormally high turnover. The suppressor I got was nice, though. To be fair, the guns that often make business sense are generally derided by all the men that know anything about guns. Case in point: Hi-Point guns are notoriously heavy and un-ergonomic but are accurate, reliable, and cheap. They did this by minimizing the number of parts that needed to be milled or had tight tolerance so they could use stamped sheet metal and plastic for most of the parts. This makes for a gun that nobody likes, but people buy anyway because it's really good at doing what guns do best: Sit in a drawer for decades just in case the owner has to deal with an ***hole someday. In all good conscience, one cannot recommend any more than a market cap weighting of your investments to small arms manufacturers, which are less than 1% of the total market.","Just a data point: It’s alluded to above, but Remington Ammunition (before Remington Outdoors) went bankrupt in 2020 during a hot market for both ammunition and firearms.

,"What you probably think of gun maker stocks is they're priced as industrials but with a lot of regulatory risks. That's all true, but you'd also be surprised just how many of these companies go bankrupt. Most larger brands that you would have heard have had filed for bankruptcy at some point, some pretty recently, and other companies have gone bankrupt during wartime when you'd think their business model is unsinkable. Especially with smaller firms, because the sheer volume of independent machinists that have come and gone over the years can boggle the mind. It always comes down to at least one of very simple reasons: People simply weren't buying the guns. A large portion of sales were supposed to go to a single customer (usually a government). The weapon was far too niche and there simply wasn't as much market for it as they thought. Weapons sales are strongly correlated to fear. When people fear other people, they buy weapons, meaning demand for weapons of different types varies by as much as 100% in a given year. Didn't have money for requisite equipment. Specialized custom machines needed (lathes, forges, milling robot, rivet machine, etc). Many weapons may sit in storage for years before being sold while workers need salaries and rent needs paid. Manufacturing less profitable than anticipated. Quality control entails frequent re-milling of parts and labor costs ensue. Competition with other manufacturers drives down prices. The first reason is by far the most common. Recall that weapons are not consumer products and any decently made gun will outlive the owner. Also, they aren't cheap, and the user needs to balance getting a nice gun with what is within their budget. It's possible to spend ten grand on a handgun, and to be fair those guns have awesome precision, but the ordinary man who just needs a burglar gun might opt for an old west style revolver because they're cheap and super reliable. This highlights another major point because weapons sales can be a fat-margin high-risk business, and it can be a narrow-margin low-risk business often with no actual changes to the weapons themselves. In any case, it's a business that heavily favors economies of scale but that is often impossible because what the customer needs isn't standard. I personally own a gun that I had custom assembled from Sig Sauer because I couldn't find anything on the market that had all the things I wanted. Also, since this is a defense industry all countries, often really tiny ones, want indigenous production to the point that state-sponsored patent violations have occurred throughout history. Often key parts of the manufacturing process are nationalized, meaning some overtly unprofitable factories are propped up artificially for decades. For instance, the Mexican Federales use to buy guns from H&K but decided they wanted to make their own but were too cheap to design their own. So they took the rifle they had in service and changed enough of the internals to circumvent patent laws and had uniformed soldiers assemble the guns. High-risk startup behavior is far more common with arms than other heavy manufacturing. In one case during World War One, a group of 8 machinists got together and decided they'd make guns but they took all the contracts they could thinking they could just use the contracts as collateral for loans to set up a factory (of course governments only gave them said contracts because they neglected to mention they had no factory). Needless to say, they didn't get enough money together for the factory and the scheme fell through. In another case in the 1950's some machinists made a new invention of a gun that could fire several different cartridges, and this was a very atomic-age gun with everything made of streamlined aluminum. Of course, costs proved higher than anticipated and sales lower than anticipated and even the chosen name of gun Wolverine proved a problem since that name was already taken. This story wasn't all sad as these guys actually kept their people working while the boss worked on finding them new jobs and sold the guns over the years following the shop's closure. This highlights another point is that you should be more than a little skeptical when looking at small arms technology because it's never nearly as revolutionary as you think. Usually it's just a gimmick that may fill some niche but has no chance of going mainstream. For instance, Ammo Inc makes precision rounds, tracer rounds, and quiet rounds which all sounds nice if you're a US Army sniper but how big is that market? Probably not as big as you think, and its size and composition would vary year to year as army needs and budgets change. To be fair, it is possible for an independent gunsmith to have prodigious success. One British guy and his family would make custom sniper rifles for Olympic competitive marksmen and they heard the British army announce a competition for a new sniper rifle. They entered their rifle just so they could say they did it, but to their surprise the British army snipers decided they wanted the Olympic rifle to be standard issue. That set these guys scrambling to make enough guns to start making deliveries whilst contracting a machine shop to help which was more problematic than it sounds since the machine shop kept taking shortcuts.

,"What you probably think of gun maker stocks is they're priced as industrials but with a lot of regulatory risks. That's all true, but you'd also be surprised just how many of these companies go bankrupt. Most larger brands that you would have heard have had filed for bankruptcy at some point, some pretty recently, and other companies have gone bankrupt during wartime when you'd think their business model is unsinkable. Especially with smaller firms, because the sheer volume of independent machinists that have come and gone over the years can boggle the mind. It always comes down to at least one of very simple reasons: People simply weren't buying the guns. A large portion of sales were supposed to go to a single customer (usually a government). The weapon was far too niche and there simply wasn't as much market for it as they thought. Weapons sales are strongly correlated to fear. When people fear other people, they buy weapons, meaning demand for weapons of different types varies by as much as 100% in a given year. Didn't have money for requisite equipment. Specialized custom machines needed (lathes, forges, milling robot, rivet machine, etc). Many weapons may sit in storage for years before being sold while workers need salaries and rent needs paid. Manufacturing less profitable than anticipated. Quality control entails frequent re-milling of parts and labor costs ensue. Competition with other manufacturers drives down prices. The first reason is by far the most common. Recall that weapons are not consumer products and any decently made gun will outlive the owner. Also, they aren't cheap, and the user needs to balance getting a nice gun with what is within their budget. It's possible to spend ten grand on a handgun, and to be fair those guns have awesome precision, but the ordinary man who just needs a burglar gun might opt for an old west style revolver because they're cheap and super reliable. This highlights another major point because weapons sales can be a fat-margin high-risk business, and it can be a narrow-margin low-risk business often with no actual changes to the weapons themselves. In any case, it's a business that heavily favors economies of scale but that is often impossible because what the customer needs isn't standard.

These guys loaded the company up with debt, pocketed the borrowed money, took the company public again (now crippled with debt), and rowed off in their zillion dollar lifeboat as the ship slowly sank.From the article:In order to buy Remington, Cerberus, as most private-equity firms would, created a new entity, a holding company. Instead of Cerberus buying a gun company, Cerberus put money into the holding company, and the holding company bought Remington. The entities were related but — and this was crucial — each could borrow money independently. In 2010, Cerberus had the holding company borrow $225 million from an undisclosed group of lenders, most likely hedge funds. Because this loan was risky — the lenders would be paid only if Remington made a lot of money or was sold — the holding company offered a generous interest rate of around 11 percent, much higher than a typical corporate loan. When the interest payments were due, the holding company paid them not in cash but with paid-in-kind notes, that is, with more debt. These are known as PIK notes.The holding company now had $225 million in borrowed cash. Cerberus, meanwhile, owned most of the shares of the holding company’s stock, basically slips of paper they acquired when they created the holding company. The handoff happened next: The holding company spent most of the $225 million buying back its own stock, effectively transferring all the borrowed cash to Cerberus. Cerberus would keep that money no matter what. Meanwhile Remington continued rolling along as though nothing had happened, because Remington itself was not responsible for the holding company’s debt. Remington was just an “operating company” that the holding company owned, something that allowed the holding company to borrow money, the way you would take a necklace to a pawnshop. These were garden-variety maneuvers in a private-equity buyout. In the trade, this is called “financial engineering.” People get degrees in it.In April 2012, Cerberus did something fateful, which probably seemed smart at the time. It had Remington borrow hundreds of millions of dollars and use it to buy the holding company’s debt, effectively transferring responsibility for the principal and the interest payments onto Remington. America’s oldest gun company now owed the money that Cerberus had used to pay itself back for having bought the company in the first place. There were plenty of sensible reasons to do this. Gun sales were high, and the debt that Remington took out was cheaper to service than the paid-in-kind debt.But there was a catch. Because the operating company borrowed the money with a normal loan — and not with PIK notes — interest payments were required in cash. Suddenly Remington was carrying hundreds of millions of dollars in debt that, if it could not be paid, would cause the business to go bankrupt.By the time the factory opened in Huntsville, the various players stood in vastly different positions. The private-equity firm had made back its initial investment and was playing with house money. Remington owed hundreds of millions that it hadn’t borrowed. And its workers, urgently, had to make a lot of guns.",4,0.566,NEGATIVE,1.0

,"What you probably think of gun maker stocks is they're priced as industrials but with a lot of regulatory risks. That's all true, but you'd also be surprised just how many of these companies go bankrupt. Most larger brands that you would have heard have had filed for bankruptcy at some point, some pretty recently, and other companies have gone bankrupt during wartime when you'd think their business model is unsinkable. Especially with smaller firms, because the sheer volume of independent machinists that have come and gone over the years can boggle the mind. It always comes down to at least one of very simple reasons: People simply weren't buying the guns. A large portion of sales were supposed to go to a single customer (usually a government). The weapon was far too niche and there simply wasn't as much market for it as they thought. Weapons sales are strongly correlated to fear. When people fear other people, they buy weapons, meaning demand for weapons of different types varies by as much as 100% in a given year. Didn't have money for requisite equipment. Specialized custom machines needed (lathes, forges, milling robot, rivet machine, etc). Many weapons may sit in storage for years before being sold while workers need salaries and rent needs paid. Manufacturing less profitable than anticipated. Quality control entails frequent re-milling of parts and labor costs ensue. Competition with other manufacturers drives down prices. The first reason is by far the most common. Recall that weapons are not consumer products and any decently made gun will outlive the owner. Also, they aren't cheap, and the user needs to balance getting a nice gun with what is within their budget. It's possible to spend ten grand on a handgun, and to be fair those guns have awesome precision, but the ordinary man who just needs a burglar gun might opt for an old west style revolver because they're cheap and super reliable. This highlights another major point because weapons sales can be a fat-margin high-risk business, and it can be a narrow-margin low-risk business often with no actual changes to the weapons themselves. In any case, it's a business that heavily favors economies of scale but that is often impossible because what the customer needs isn't standard. I personally own a gun that I had custom assembled from Sig Sauer because I couldn't find anything on the market that had all the things I wanted. Also, since this is a defense industry all countries, often really tiny ones, want indigenous production to the point that state-sponsored patent violations have occurred throughout history. Often key parts of the manufacturing process are nationalized, meaning some overtly unprofitable factories are propped up artificially for decades. For instance, the Mexican Federales use to buy guns from H&K but decided they wanted to make their own but were too cheap to design their own. So they took the rifle they had in service and changed enough of the internals to circumvent patent laws and had uniformed soldiers assemble the guns. High-risk startup behavior is far more common with arms than other heavy manufacturing. In one case during World War One, a group of 8 machinists got together and decided they'd make guns but they took all the contracts they could thinking they could just use the contracts as collateral for loans to set up a factory (of course governments only gave them said contracts because they neglected to mention they had no factory). Needless to say, they didn't get enough money together for the factory and the scheme fell through. In another case in the 1950's some machinists made a new invention of a gun that could fire several different cartridges, and this was a very atomic-age gun with everything made of streamlined aluminum. Of course, costs proved higher than anticipated and sales lower than anticipated and even the chosen name of gun Wolverine proved a problem since that name was already taken. This story wasn't all sad as these guys actually kept their people working while the boss worked on finding them new jobs and sold the guns over the years following the shop's closure. This highlights another point is that you should be more than a little skeptical when looking at small arms technology because it's never nearly as revolutionary as you think. Usually it's just a gimmick that may fill some niche but has no chance of going mainstream. For instance, Ammo Inc makes precision rounds, tracer rounds, and quiet rounds which all sounds nice if you're a US Army sniper but how big is that market? Probably not as big as you think, and its size and composition would vary year to year as army needs and budgets change. To be fair, it is possible for an independent gunsmith to have prodigious success. One British guy and his family would make custom sniper rifles for Olympic competitive marksmen and they heard the British army announce a competition for a new sniper rifle. They entered their rifle just so they could say they did it, but to their surprise the British army snipers decided they wanted the Olympic rifle to be standard issue. That set these guys scrambling to make enough guns to start making deliveries whilst contracting a machine shop to help which was more problematic than it sounds since the machine shop kept taking shortcuts. However, Remington Arms, which is among the oldest and most standard gun makers in the world, filed for bankruptcy twice in the last decade. They filed for bankruptcy in the middle of the Covid Panic when sales were prodigiously high. Of course, the reason was more long-term because they owed a lot of people money and didn't have the money coming in regularly. Now I told you that so you'd understand this: Gunsmiths are really bad businessmen. The men who want to be gunsmiths are really interested in producing bad*** weapons and are often divorced from what the average user wants or needs. The position is analogous to the legendary sword makers you see in Saxon and Norse sagas where the character is always a retired war veteran that crafts the finest tools of war for the noble hero. You understand, there's often ego involved in this. Samuel Colt himself was known to fire people for suggesting changes to his way of making the guns, and Colt would file for bankruptcy twice in his lifetime. When I bought a suppressor the company I bought it from insisted on helping with all the ATF paperwork which just made things even more complicated than they already were. I read elsewhere that these guys were so paranoid about mistakes that the firm had abnormally high turnover. The suppressor I got was nice, though. To be fair, the guns that often make business sense are generally derided by all the men that know anything about guns. Case in point: Hi-Point guns are notoriously heavy and un-ergonomic but are accurate, reliable, and cheap. They did this by minimizing the number of parts that needed to be milled or had tight tolerance so they could use stamped sheet metal and plastic for most of the parts. This makes for a gun that nobody likes, but people buy anyway because it's really good at doing what guns do best: Sit in a drawer for decades just in case the owner has to deal with an ***hole someday.

,"What you probably think of gun maker stocks is they're priced as industrials but with a lot of regulatory risks. That's all true, but you'd also be surprised just how many of these companies go bankrupt. Most larger brands that you would have heard have had filed for bankruptcy at some point, some pretty recently, and other companies have gone bankrupt during wartime when you'd think their business model is unsinkable. Especially with smaller firms, because the sheer volume of independent machinists that have come and gone over the years can boggle the mind. It always comes down to at least one of very simple reasons: People simply weren't buying the guns. A large portion of sales were supposed to go to a single customer (usually a government). The weapon was far too niche and there simply wasn't as much market for it as they thought. Weapons sales are strongly correlated to fear. When people fear other people, they buy weapons, meaning demand for weapons of different types varies by as much as 100% in a given year. Didn't have money for requisite equipment. Specialized custom machines needed (lathes, forges, milling robot, rivet machine, etc). Many weapons may sit in storage for years before being sold while workers need salaries and rent needs paid. Manufacturing less profitable than anticipated. Quality control entails frequent re-milling of parts and labor costs ensue. Competition with other manufacturers drives down prices. The first reason is by far the most common. Recall that weapons are not consumer products and any decently made gun will outlive the owner. Also, they aren't cheap, and the user needs to balance getting a nice gun with what is within their budget. It's possible to spend ten grand on a handgun, and to be fair those guns have awesome precision, but the ordinary man who just needs a burglar gun might opt for an old west style revolver because they're cheap and super reliable. This highlights another major point because weapons sales can be a fat-margin high-risk business, and it can be a narrow-margin low-risk business often with no actual changes to the weapons themselves. In any case, it's a business that heavily favors economies of scale but that is often impossible because what the customer needs isn't standard. I personally own a gun that I had custom assembled from Sig Sauer because I couldn't find anything on the market that had all the things I wanted. Also, since this is a defense industry all countries, often really tiny ones, want indigenous production to the point that state-sponsored patent violations have occurred throughout history. Often key parts of the manufacturing process are nationalized, meaning some overtly unprofitable factories are propped up artificially for decades. For instance, the Mexican Federales use to buy guns from H&K but decided they wanted to make their own but were too cheap to design their own. So they took the rifle they had in service and changed enough of the internals to circumvent patent laws and had uniformed soldiers assemble the guns. High-risk startup behavior is far more common with arms than other heavy manufacturing. In one case during World War One, a group of 8 machinists got together and decided they'd make guns but they took all the contracts they could thinking they could just use the contracts as collateral for loans to set up a factory (of course governments only gave them said contracts because they neglected to mention they had no factory). Needless to say, they didn't get enough money together for the factory and the scheme fell through. In another case in the 1950's some machinists made a new invention of a gun that could fire several different cartridges, and this was a very atomic-age gun with everything made of streamlined aluminum. Of course, costs proved higher than anticipated and sales lower than anticipated and even the chosen name of gun Wolverine proved a problem since that name was already taken. This story wasn't all sad as these guys actually kept their people working while the boss worked on finding them new jobs and sold the guns over the years following the shop's closure. This highlights another point is that you should be more than a little skeptical when looking at small arms technology because it's never nearly as revolutionary as you think. Usually it's just a gimmick that may fill some niche but has no chance of going mainstream. For instance, Ammo Inc makes precision rounds, tracer rounds, and quiet rounds which all sounds nice if you're a US Army sniper but how big is that market? Probably not as big as you think, and its size and composition would vary year to year as army needs and budgets change. To be fair, it is possible for an independent gunsmith to have prodigious success. One British guy and his family would make custom sniper rifles for Olympic competitive marksmen and they heard the British army announce a competition for a new sniper rifle. They entered their rifle just so they could say they did it, but to their surprise the British army snipers decided they wanted the Olympic rifle to be standard issue. That set these guys scrambling to make enough guns to start making deliveries whilst contracting a machine shop to help which was more problematic than it sounds since the machine shop kept taking shortcuts. However, Remington Arms, which is among the oldest and most standard gun makers in the world, filed for bankruptcy twice in the last decade. They filed for bankruptcy in the middle of the Covid Panic when sales were prodigiously high. Of course, the reason was more long-term because they owed a lot of people money and didn't have the money coming in regularly. Now I told you that so you'd understand this: Gunsmiths are really bad businessmen. The men who want to be gunsmiths are really interested in producing bad*** weapons and are often divorced from what the average user wants or needs. The position is analogous to the legendary sword makers you see in Saxon and Norse sagas where the character is always a retired war veteran that crafts the finest tools of war for the noble hero. You understand, there's often ego involved in this. Samuel Colt himself was known to fire people for suggesting changes to his way of making the guns, and Colt would file for bankruptcy twice in his lifetime. When I bought a suppressor the company I bought it from insisted on helping with all the ATF paperwork which just made things even more complicated than they already were.

,"What you probably think of gun maker stocks is they're priced as industrials but with a lot of regulatory risks. That's all true, but you'd also be surprised just how many of these companies go bankrupt. Most larger brands that you would have heard have had filed for bankruptcy at some point, some pretty recently, and other companies have gone bankrupt during wartime when you'd think their business model is unsinkable. Especially with smaller firms, because the sheer volume of independent machinists that have come and gone over the years can boggle the mind. It always comes down to at least one of very simple reasons: People simply weren't buying the guns. A large portion of sales were supposed to go to a single customer (usually a government). The weapon was far too niche and there simply wasn't as much market for it as they thought. Weapons sales are strongly correlated to fear. When people fear other people, they buy weapons, meaning demand for weapons of different types varies by as much as 100% in a given year. Didn't have money for requisite equipment. Specialized custom machines needed (lathes, forges, milling robot, rivet machine, etc). Many weapons may sit in storage for years before being sold while workers need salaries and rent needs paid. Manufacturing less profitable than anticipated. Quality control entails frequent re-milling of parts and labor costs ensue. Competition with other manufacturers drives down prices. The first reason is by far the most common. Recall that weapons are not consumer products and any decently made gun will outlive the owner. Also, they aren't cheap, and the user needs to balance getting a nice gun with what is within their budget. It's possible to spend ten grand on a handgun, and to be fair those guns have awesome precision, but the ordinary man who just needs a burglar gun might opt for an old west style revolver because they're cheap and super reliable. This highlights another major point because weapons sales can be a fat-margin high-risk business, and it can be a narrow-margin low-risk business often with no actual changes to the weapons themselves. In any case, it's a business that heavily favors economies of scale but that is often impossible because what the customer needs isn't standard. I personally own a gun that I had custom assembled from Sig Sauer because I couldn't find anything on the market that had all the things I wanted. Also, since this is a defense industry all countries, often really tiny ones, want indigenous production to the point that state-sponsored patent violations have occurred throughout history. Often key parts of the manufacturing process are nationalized, meaning some overtly unprofitable factories are propped up artificially for decades. For instance, the Mexican Federales use to buy guns from H&K but decided they wanted to make their own but were too cheap to design their own. So they took the rifle they had in service and changed enough of the internals to circumvent patent laws and had uniformed soldiers assemble the guns. High-risk startup behavior is far more common with arms than other heavy manufacturing. In one case during World War One, a group of 8 machinists got together and decided they'd make guns but they took all the contracts they could thinking they could just use the contracts as collateral for loans to set up a factory (of course governments only gave them said contracts because they neglected to mention they had no factory). Needless to say, they didn't get enough money together for the factory and the scheme fell through. In another case in the 1950's some machinists made a new invention of a gun that could fire several different cartridges, and this was a very atomic-age gun with everything made of streamlined aluminum. Of course, costs proved higher than anticipated and sales lower than anticipated and even the chosen name of gun Wolverine proved a problem since that name was already taken. This story wasn't all sad as these guys actually kept their people working while the boss worked on finding them new jobs and sold the guns over the years following the shop's closure. This highlights another point is that you should be more than a little skeptical when looking at small arms technology because it's never nearly as revolutionary as you think. Usually it's just a gimmick that may fill some niche but has no chance of going mainstream. For instance, Ammo Inc makes precision rounds, tracer rounds, and quiet rounds which all sounds nice if you're a US Army sniper but how big is that market? Probably not as big as you think, and its size and composition would vary year to year as army needs and budgets change. To be fair, it is possible for an independent gunsmith to have prodigious success. One British guy and his family would make custom sniper rifles for Olympic competitive marksmen and they heard the British army announce a competition for a new sniper rifle. They entered their rifle just so they could say they did it, but to their surprise the British army snipers decided they wanted the Olympic rifle to be standard issue. That set these guys scrambling to make enough guns to start making deliveries whilst contracting a machine shop to help which was more problematic than it sounds since the machine shop kept taking shortcuts. However, Remington Arms, which is among the oldest and most standard gun makers in the world, filed for bankruptcy twice in the last decade. They filed for bankruptcy in the middle of the Covid Panic when sales were prodigiously high. Of course, the reason was more long-term because they owed a lot of people money and didn't have the money coming in regularly. Now I told you that so you'd understand this: Gunsmiths are really bad businessmen. The men who want to be gunsmiths are really interested in producing bad*** weapons and are often divorced from what the average user wants or needs. The position is analogous to the legendary sword makers you see in Saxon and Norse sagas where the character is always a retired war veteran that crafts the finest tools of war for the noble hero. You understand, there's often ego involved in this. Samuel Colt himself was known to fire people for suggesting changes to his way of making the guns, and Colt would file for bankruptcy twice in his lifetime.

,"What you probably think of gun maker stocks is they're priced as industrials but with a lot of regulatory risks. That's all true, but you'd also be surprised just how many of these companies go bankrupt. Most larger brands that you would have heard have had filed for bankruptcy at some point, some pretty recently, and other companies have gone bankrupt during wartime when you'd think their business model is unsinkable. Especially with smaller firms, because the sheer volume of independent machinists that have come and gone over the years can boggle the mind. It always comes down to at least one of very simple reasons: People simply weren't buying the guns. A large portion of sales were supposed to go to a single customer (usually a government). The weapon was far too niche and there simply wasn't as much market for it as they thought. Weapons sales are strongly correlated to fear. When people fear other people, they buy weapons, meaning demand for weapons of different types varies by as much as 100% in a given year. Didn't have money for requisite equipment. Specialized custom machines needed (lathes, forges, milling robot, rivet machine, etc). Many weapons may sit in storage for years before being sold while workers need salaries and rent needs paid. Manufacturing less profitable than anticipated. Quality control entails frequent re-milling of parts and labor costs ensue. Competition with other manufacturers drives down prices. The first reason is by far the most common. Recall that weapons are not consumer products and any decently made gun will outlive the owner. Also, they aren't cheap, and the user needs to balance getting a nice gun with what is within their budget. It's possible to spend ten grand on a handgun, and to be fair those guns have awesome precision, but the ordinary man who just needs a burglar gun might opt for an old west style revolver because they're cheap and super reliable. This highlights another major point because weapons sales can be a fat-margin high-risk business, and it can be a narrow-margin low-risk business often with no actual changes to the weapons themselves. In any case, it's a business that heavily favors economies of scale but that is often impossible because what the customer needs isn't standard. I personally own a gun that I had custom assembled from Sig Sauer because I couldn't find anything on the market that had all the things I wanted. Also, since this is a defense industry all countries, often really tiny ones, want indigenous production to the point that state-sponsored patent violations have occurred throughout history. Often key parts of the manufacturing process are nationalized, meaning some overtly unprofitable factories are propped up artificially for decades. For instance, the Mexican Federales use to buy guns from H&K but decided they wanted to make their own but were too cheap to design their own. So they took the rifle they had in service and changed enough of the internals to circumvent patent laws and had uniformed soldiers assemble the guns. High-risk startup behavior is far more common with arms than other heavy manufacturing. In one case during World War One, a group of 8 machinists got together and decided they'd make guns but they took all the contracts they could thinking they could just use the contracts as collateral for loans to set up a factory (of course governments only gave them said contracts because they neglected to mention they had no factory). Needless to say, they didn't get enough money together for the factory and the scheme fell through. In another case in the 1950's some machinists made a new invention of a gun that could fire several different cartridges, and this was a very atomic-age gun with everything made of streamlined aluminum. Of course, costs proved higher than anticipated and sales lower than anticipated and even the chosen name of gun Wolverine proved a problem since that name was already taken. This story wasn't all sad as these guys actually kept their people working while the boss worked on finding them new jobs and sold the guns over the years following the shop's closure. This highlights another point is that you should be more than a little skeptical when looking at small arms technology because it's never nearly as revolutionary as you think. Usually it's just a gimmick that may fill some niche but has no chance of going mainstream. For instance, Ammo Inc makes precision rounds, tracer rounds, and quiet rounds which all sounds nice if you're a US Army sniper but how big is that market? Probably not as big as you think, and its size and composition would vary year to year as army needs and budgets change. To be fair, it is possible for an independent gunsmith to have prodigious success. One British guy and his family would make custom sniper rifles for Olympic competitive marksmen and they heard the British army announce a competition for a new sniper rifle. They entered their rifle just so they could say they did it, but to their surprise the British army snipers decided they wanted the Olympic rifle to be standard issue. That set these guys scrambling to make enough guns to start making deliveries whilst contracting a machine shop to help which was more problematic than it sounds since the machine shop kept taking shortcuts. However, Remington Arms, which is among the oldest and most standard gun makers in the world, filed for bankruptcy twice in the last decade. They filed for bankruptcy in the middle of the Covid Panic when sales were prodigiously high. Of course, the reason was more long-term because they owed a lot of people money and didn't have the money coming in regularly. Now I told you that so you'd understand this: Gunsmiths are really bad businessmen. The men who want to be gunsmiths are really interested in producing bad*** weapons and are often divorced from what the average user wants or needs. The position is analogous to the legendary sword makers you see in Saxon and Norse sagas where the character is always a retired war veteran that crafts the finest tools of war for the noble hero.

,"What you probably think of gun maker stocks is they're priced as industrials but with a lot of regulatory risks. That's all true, but you'd also be surprised just how many of these companies go bankrupt. Most larger brands that you would have heard have had filed for bankruptcy at some point, some pretty recently, and other companies have gone bankrupt during wartime when you'd think their business model is unsinkable. Especially with smaller firms, because the sheer volume of independent machinists that have come and gone over the years can boggle the mind. It always comes down to at least one of very simple reasons: People simply weren't buying the guns. A large portion of sales were supposed to go to a single customer (usually a government). The weapon was far too niche and there simply wasn't as much market for it as they thought. Weapons sales are strongly correlated to fear. When people fear other people, they buy weapons, meaning demand for weapons of different types varies by as much as 100% in a given year. Didn't have money for requisite equipment. Specialized custom machines needed (lathes, forges, milling robot, rivet machine, etc). Many weapons may sit in storage for years before being sold while workers need salaries and rent needs paid. Manufacturing less profitable than anticipated. Quality control entails frequent re-milling of parts and labor costs ensue. Competition with other manufacturers drives down prices. The first reason is by far the most common. Recall that weapons are not consumer products and any decently made gun will outlive the owner. Also, they aren't cheap, and the user needs to balance getting a nice gun with what is within their budget. It's possible to spend ten grand on a handgun, and to be fair those guns have awesome precision, but the ordinary man who just needs a burglar gun might opt for an old west style revolver because they're cheap and super reliable. This highlights another major point because weapons sales can be a fat-margin high-risk business, and it can be a narrow-margin low-risk business often with no actual changes to the weapons themselves. In any case, it's a business that heavily favors economies of scale but that is often impossible because what the customer needs isn't standard. I personally own a gun that I had custom assembled from Sig Sauer because I couldn't find anything on the market that had all the things I wanted. Also, since this is a defense industry all countries, often really tiny ones, want indigenous production to the point that state-sponsored patent violations have occurred throughout history. Often key parts of the manufacturing process are nationalized, meaning some overtly unprofitable factories are propped up artificially for decades. For instance, the Mexican Federales use to buy guns from H&K but decided they wanted to make their own but were too cheap to design their own. So they took the rifle they had in service and changed enough of the internals to circumvent patent laws and had uniformed soldiers assemble the guns. High-risk startup behavior is far more common with arms than other heavy manufacturing. In one case during World War One, a group of 8 machinists got together and decided they'd make guns but they took all the contracts they could thinking they could just use the contracts as collateral for loans to set up a factory (of course governments only gave them said contracts because they neglected to mention they had no factory). Needless to say, they didn't get enough money together for the factory and the scheme fell through. In another case in the 1950's some machinists made a new invention of a gun that could fire several different cartridges, and this was a very atomic-age gun with everything made of streamlined aluminum. Of course, costs proved higher than anticipated and sales lower than anticipated and even the chosen name of gun Wolverine proved a problem since that name was already taken. This story wasn't all sad as these guys actually kept their people working while the boss worked on finding them new jobs and sold the guns over the years following the shop's closure. This highlights another point is that you should be more than a little skeptical when looking at small arms technology because it's never nearly as revolutionary as you think. Usually it's just a gimmick that may fill some niche but has no chance of going mainstream. For instance, Ammo Inc makes precision rounds, tracer rounds, and quiet rounds which all sounds nice if you're a US Army sniper but how big is that market? Probably not as big as you think, and its size and composition would vary year to year as army needs and budgets change. To be fair, it is possible for an independent gunsmith to have prodigious success. One British guy and his family would make custom sniper rifles for Olympic competitive marksmen and they heard the British army announce a competition for a new sniper rifle. They entered their rifle just so they could say they did it, but to their surprise the British army snipers decided they wanted the Olympic rifle to be standard issue. That set these guys scrambling to make enough guns to start making deliveries whilst contracting a machine shop to help which was more problematic than it sounds since the machine shop kept taking shortcuts. However, Remington Arms, which is among the oldest and most standard gun makers in the world, filed for bankruptcy twice in the last decade. They filed for bankruptcy in the middle of the Covid Panic when sales were prodigiously high. Of course, the reason was more long-term because they owed a lot of people money and didn't have the money coming in regularly. Now I told you that so you'd understand this: Gunsmiths are really bad businessmen. The men who want to be gunsmiths are really interested in producing bad*** weapons and are often divorced from what the average user wants or needs. The position is analogous to the legendary sword makers you see in Saxon and Norse sagas where the character is always a retired war veteran that crafts the finest tools of war for the noble hero. You understand, there's often ego involved in this. Samuel Colt himself was known to fire people for suggesting changes to his way of making the guns, and Colt would file for bankruptcy twice in his lifetime. When I bought a suppressor the company I bought it from insisted on helping with all the ATF paperwork which just made things even more complicated than they already were. I read elsewhere that these guys were so paranoid about mistakes that the firm had abnormally high turnover. The suppressor I got was nice, though.
