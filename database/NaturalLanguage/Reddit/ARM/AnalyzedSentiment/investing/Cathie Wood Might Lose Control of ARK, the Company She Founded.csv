,"Cathie Wood Might Lose Control Of ARK Investment ARK Investment Management-a privately-held asset manager founded just six years ago-has been in the spotlight a lot this year thanks to its vocal founder and stellar investment record. A recent regulatory filing suggests that Resolute Investment Managers—ARK funds’ U.S. distributor—plans to take control of the company early next year. It turns out that when Resolute acquired a minority stake in ARK in 2016, the deal also included an option that allows Resolute to purchase a controlling stake—if it wants—before the option expires in early 2021. ARK, which manages $30 billion in assets, including $15 billion across seven exchange-traded funds, has more than tripled its assets in the past year alone. Now, Resolute is exercising its option to own a bigger piece of the cake. Cathie Wood, ARK’s founder and CEO who owns 50% to 75% of the firm, is fighting the takeover. In a statement, Wood said she is “disappointed” about Resolute’s “unwelcome notice” of its intention to seize control of the business. “The remarkable success of our team is rooted firmly in a culture of transparency, collaboration, and employee ownership,” she wrote. “We do not believe that equity ownership by a party tangential to our business is in the best interest of ARK’s stakeholders.” Wood didn’t comment beyond the statement. Ben Johnson, director of global exchange-traded fund research for Morningstar, highly doubts there will be a management change at ARK. ""Resolute has been operating largely at arm's length, distributing products and opening doors for the ARK team and not necessarily meddling in their day-to-day affairs and telling them how to manage money,"" says Johnson, ""What they want to do is to exercise the call option that is very much in the money right now, that's what they signed up on.""","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

Then, Resolute made these filings in retaliation. I doubt that either party wants Resolute to take a controlling stake in the company. Since the end of the contract is coming up, Ms. Wood likely made the public statements intentionally in order to get Resolute to the negotiation table before resigning with them past 2021.My guess is that Resolute and ARK renegotiate their contract, ARK resigns with Resolute (a win for Resolute), and the new contract doesn't have an option for Resolute to take a controlling stake in ARK (a win for ARK).",1,0.541,NEGATIVE,1.0

A recent regulatory filing suggests that Resolute Investment Managers—ARK funds’ U.S. distributor—plans to take control of the company early next year. It turns out that when Resolute acquired a minority stake in ARK in 2016, the deal also included an option that allows Resolute to purchase a controlling stake—if it wants—before the option expires in early 2021. ARK, which manages $30 billion in assets, including $15 billion across seven exchange-traded funds, has more than tripled its assets in the past year alone. Now, Resolute is exercising its option to own a bigger piece of the cake. Cathie Wood, ARK’s founder and CEO who owns 50% to 75% of the firm, is fighting the takeover. In a statement, Wood said she is “disappointed” about Resolute’s “unwelcome notice” of its intention to seize control of the business. “The remarkable success of our team is rooted firmly in a culture of transparency, collaboration, and employee ownership,” she wrote. “We do not believe that equity ownership by a party tangential to our business is in the best interest of ARK’s stakeholders.” Wood didn’t comment beyond the statement.

ARK, which manages $30 billion in assets, including $15 billion across seven exchange-traded funds, has more than tripled its assets in the past year alone. Now, Resolute is exercising its option to own a bigger piece of the cake. Cathie Wood, ARK’s founder and CEO who owns 50% to 75% of the firm, is fighting the takeover. In a statement, Wood said she is “disappointed” about Resolute’s “unwelcome notice” of its intention to seize control of the business. “The remarkable success of our team is rooted firmly in a culture of transparency, collaboration, and employee ownership,” she wrote. “We do not believe that equity ownership by a party tangential to our business is in the best interest of ARK’s stakeholders.” Wood didn’t comment beyond the statement. Ben Johnson, director of global exchange-traded fund research for Morningstar, highly doubts there will be a management change at ARK. ""Resolute has been operating largely at arm's length, distributing products and opening doors for the ARK team and not necessarily meddling in their day-to-day affairs and telling them how to manage money,"" says Johnson, ""What they want to do is to exercise the call option that is very much in the money right now, that's what they signed up on.""",I will be messaging you in 30 days on 2021-01-08 05:55:19 UTC to remind you of this linkCLICK THIS LINK to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.Parent commenter can delete this message to hide from others.Info Custom Your Reminders Feedback,1,0.51,NEGATIVE,0.993
