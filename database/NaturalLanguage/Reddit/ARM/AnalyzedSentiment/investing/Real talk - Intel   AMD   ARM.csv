,"Intel is on record saying that this is an industry wide issue. AMD has said there is ""near zero impact"". Clearly, someone is not telling the truth. Is Intel playing damage control and not actually admitting this is only Intel chips? Or is AMD simply not 100% certain on the implication and took this opportunity to try and get market share (so far, stocks prices are way in AMD's favor). Does anyone here have FACTS, besides just the typical Intel bashing. The only FACTS I have, is that in the conference call that Intel had last night, stated this is an industry wide issue and that the research group contacted Intel with AMD and ARM about these issues. Granted, Intel has the biggest exposure and the most to lose so they'll try and downplay it... but by saying ""Industry wide"" isn't the implying that AMD and ARM are affected too?

AMD is technically vulnerable to this, but it is not practically exploitable because of architecture differences. Notably, there is no proof-of-concept exploit for AMD CPUs.
