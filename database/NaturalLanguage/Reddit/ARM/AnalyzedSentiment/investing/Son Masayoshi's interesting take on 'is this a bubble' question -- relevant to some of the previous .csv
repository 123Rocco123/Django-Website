What do you think?","mmm....I think this is where people get it wrong. Its only a bubble if there is malinvestment that is unwinded through leverage that causes collateral damage to the banking system/run on a bank, etc. 2001 was bad because you had WCOM and Enron dabbled on top of IPOs that were being financed with no chance of repaying their loans. 2008 was bad because of bear and lehman collapse. These events caused liquidity traps. But if you have companies like AMZN or TSLA that are probably never going to go bankrupt in our lifetimes, it really doesn't matter what their P/E ratio is...they can keep going up basically forever as long as money is being printed and saved in those companies. If the music never stops and companies arent going bankrupt and loans are being repaid than prices can go up practically forever. Historical measures of P/E ratios are irrelevant.Has nothing to do with money being on the sideline. You had a shitload of money on the sideline in 2008, and that didnt save us from that bubble. You had very low liquidity in 2001 and that obviously wasnt good either.",1,0.513,NEGATIVE,1.0
