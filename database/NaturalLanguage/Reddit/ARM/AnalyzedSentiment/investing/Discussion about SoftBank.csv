,"Softbank sold it's entire stake of Nvidia. They announced a huge share buy back program. SoftBank has stake many companies, including Alibaba, Sprint, WeWork. They own Boston Dynamics, ARM Holdings and the Vision Fund, the world's biggest technology fund. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoftBank_Group What does r/investing think about SoftBank?","It always trades at a discount to NAV but its just a VC play. You either believe Son’s “vision” or you don’t. Not unlike the true believers in Tesla.Street loves it because it’s an easy “value” story to broke, but Son’s track record as an investor ex-BABA is mixed at best; i.e., he is not a buy low/sell high guy but rather a buy high and pray he found the next FB/GOOG kinda guy.I would only Buy if 1) I believe many of his big bets will win 2) I have long enough of a time horizon to see them get valued into the stock 3) I think he will sort out his succession plan smoothly — word is it is still very much a one man kingdom.",0,0.53,NEGATIVE,0.998

SoftBank owns 50% of the equity of the fund with a 27B investment, outside investors had to buy something like 8% Preference to get in(not sure about the rate but it was something every low.) If they can earn more than 8%, soft bank is gonna make a killing. Of course the question is if they will earn 8%. I don't know enough to make a guess about that.",1,0.521,NEGATIVE,1.0
