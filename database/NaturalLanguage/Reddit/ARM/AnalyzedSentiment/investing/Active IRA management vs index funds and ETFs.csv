,"I’m curious to know where people stand on whether they think they should place their own trades in IRA accounts vs buying index funds and etfs. I’m on the side of active only because I know what I’m doing especially during high volatility when I’m able to pick up stocks at lower prices during or after selloffs. This concentrated buying has allowed me to see pretty big upside when the stock rebounds especially if it rises more than the index. The risks of this is that SPY/QQQ has been rising consistently. I have been really conservative about buying tech thinking the market will pull back and I have missed out big as a result.

You're fooling yourself if you think that they'll be obvious in foresight next time.Also, you're trying to give yourself credit for the times you should have decided something differently, but you're not accounting for the fact that the opposite is also going to be true: there will be times when you would have normally taken a bad path but didn't due to sheer luck. If you had the change to make those decisions over again, next time you could flip some winners into losers.There is a reason professional money managers usually cannot beat the indexes.
