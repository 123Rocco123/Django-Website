,"I’m a bit surprised there isn’t a VC back tech company that’s figured out how to offer people mortgages at lower than market rates. The rate would be adjustable to offset some FX fluctuations. Example China interest rate is 3.45% Japan interest rate is 3.16% US interest rate on 30 Yr fixed mortgage is 7.384% Colombia mortgage rate is 20.120% Consumer A wants to buy a $500k house. Most US banks offer a 30 year loan at 8-10% interest. Arbitrage company borrows $500k from Japanese bank at 4% fixed for 30 years. Then offers Consumer A 5.5% ARM with 30% down payment or 6.5% ARM with 20% down payment or 7% fixed with 10% down payment. Thesis - japans rates will remain low for the next 5 years, possibly 10 years. Requiring a 30% down payment provides a buffer in times of currency fluctuations and also helps to reduce the investment risk. The down payment also acts as a sort of vetting since few Americans have $1,000 saved up so the ones who have 30% saved up will be pretty safe borrowers in terms of risk. The 1.5-3% interest arbitrage also acts as a buffer. At scale, this could be packaged together and sold to retail and institutional bond investors and that spread would increase the company’s profits per sale. Lastly, homes in the US generally retain their value and due to housing supply shortages, there will be ample opportunities to liquidate. It seems that borrowing from foreign banks, regardless of the country, is incredibly hard. Most seem to only do business with their own citizens or people with long history in the country and are residents (green/residency card or passport). I’m in the U.S. and it seems pretty hard to get a loan from a Japan bank for instance. Chinese bank is even harder. I have never stepped foot in any of these countries yet. Colombia seems slightly easier but it depends on which bank location you go to and the employee. Also you could expand this to country’s with sky high interest rates such as Colombia. Pitch being that taking out the loan and buying property would help secure a green card or residency in participating countries with investment visa programs. So property values would be stable and probably propped up. As long as credit standards are maintained, there shouldn’t be any real problems like that of the US financial crash. What do you think? Update To further lessen currency risk, you could require buyer put up 10% (in the example $50,000) that would go towards an insurance policy or investment vehicle over the life of the property. At the end of the mortgage, the buyer receives whatever money is left over. If currency remained flat or deprecated, buyer would get full amount, maybe slightly less. If the currency fluctuated harder, then the buyer loses it all. This would still be cheaper than paying market rate interest over the life of the mortgage. I have very little knowledge about insurance so feel free to correct me or come up with a structure that could work.","This is called a carry trade and it isn’t an arbitrage because you have currency risk. If you tried to hedge out your currency risk by trading, for example, a USD/JPY currency swap or forward you will find this interest rate differential is already priced in, removing any chance of arbitrage.",0,0.512,POSITIVE,0.987

You can just buy bonds denominated in the local currency.Borrow Yen, convert to Dollars, buy US agency mortgage bonds. Voila. You're funding mortgages via carry trade.

Because mortgages are consumer facing, politics will get involved. Poland is a good example of this.Years ago, lenders in Poland issued 100's of thousands of Swiss Franc mortgages because of the rate differences versus Polish Zloty rates. As the Zloty devalued 33% against Franc over the last 10 years, borrower defaults were huge as their outlays far exceeded what they had expected. European courts have stepped in and ruled the mortgages have unfair terms to the borrowers. Lenders are writing off billions of dollars.",0,0.515,NEGATIVE,0.999

If you want to eliminate currency risk, you could use forward contracts to lock in the future exchange rate. Eg borrow yen. Convert to USD. Buy treasuries (this is the part where you don't need ti even mess with mortgages but the same ideas will hold). Enter forward contract to turn needed USD back to yen to pay off the borrowing. So is this free money? The answer is .... no. This opportunity is arbitraged away. The forward contract on the yen--USD trades at the price such that the interest rate differential is wiped out. Basically the forward market is pricing in an appreciation of the yen and depreciation of Colombian pesos.Now where things do get interesting: is that forward rate actually a good predictor of what the future exchange rate will be? And the evidence here is sort of - directionally yes but betting that the moves will be less significant than predicted (that is borrowing low interest rate and investing higher and NOT hedging), at least in major currencies, has likely generated a profit. Note these profits aren't normal distributions- more small wins and big losses. Still it has paid off more often then not. This trade is called the carry trade, and it's big, and levered.",0,0.523,NEGATIVE,1.0

The company would have legal entities setup in each country it operates from and would draw funds from the main entity. Think of it like a top down organizational chartArbitrage company (AC) top level - US company - takes out $500k loan from Japanese bank.AC then offers mortgage to US borrower buying a home in the US.AC subsidiary Colombia is in a joint venture with AC US and offer $200k mortgage @ 10% ARM with 30% down payment to US borrower buying a home in Colombia in order to secure a green card and eventual citizenship for retirement. Either way, the US citizen can’t avoid the debt because the company would be able to touch him in both the US (his country of residence) and Colombia (country where property is located). Money is borrowed from Japan, US citizen would be paying the loan off in dollars. I know it’s more complicated but for much better terms, I think enough people will accept complexity to save money. And it would open the market up from 4% home ownership to maybe 15% over next decade. In cases of default, for hot tourist markets such as Medellin Colombia, the property can be easily sold off to another American looking for a visa for example.Please correct me if I’m missing something",1,0.548,NEGATIVE,0.999
,"I’m a bit surprised there isn’t a VC back tech company that’s figured out how to offer people mortgages at lower than market rates. The rate would be adjustable to offset some FX fluctuations. Example China interest rate is 3.45% Japan interest rate is 3.16% US interest rate on 30 Yr fixed mortgage is 7.384% Colombia mortgage rate is 20.120% Consumer A wants to buy a $500k house. Most US banks offer a 30 year loan at 8-10% interest. Arbitrage company borrows $500k from Japanese bank at 4% fixed for 30 years. Then offers Consumer A 5.5% ARM with 30% down payment or 6.5% ARM with 20% down payment or 7% fixed with 10% down payment. Thesis - japans rates will remain low for the next 5 years, possibly 10 years. Requiring a 30% down payment provides a buffer in times of currency fluctuations and also helps to reduce the investment risk. The down payment also acts as a sort of vetting since few Americans have $1,000 saved up so the ones who have 30% saved up will be pretty safe borrowers in terms of risk. The 1.5-3% interest arbitrage also acts as a buffer. At scale, this could be packaged together and sold to retail and institutional bond investors and that spread would increase the company’s profits per sale. Lastly, homes in the US generally retain their value and due to housing supply shortages, there will be ample opportunities to liquidate. It seems that borrowing from foreign banks, regardless of the country, is incredibly hard. Most seem to only do business with their own citizens or people with long history in the country and are residents (green/residency card or passport). I’m in the U.S. and it seems pretty hard to get a loan from a Japan bank for instance. Chinese bank is even harder. I have never stepped foot in any of these countries yet. Colombia seems slightly easier but it depends on which bank location you go to and the employee. Also you could expand this to country’s with sky high interest rates such as Colombia. Pitch being that taking out the loan and buying property would help secure a green card or residency in participating countries with investment visa programs. So property values would be stable and probably propped up. As long as credit standards are maintained, there shouldn’t be any real problems like that of the US financial crash. What do you think?

Update To further lessen currency risk, you could require buyer put up 10% (in the example $50,000) that would go towards an insurance policy or investment vehicle over the life of the property. At the end of the mortgage, the buyer receives whatever money is left over. If currency remained flat or deprecated, buyer would get full amount, maybe slightly less. If the currency fluctuated harder, then the buyer loses it all. This would still be cheaper than paying market rate interest over the life of the mortgage.

,"I’m a bit surprised there isn’t a VC back tech company that’s figured out how to offer people mortgages at lower than market rates. The rate would be adjustable to offset some FX fluctuations. Example China interest rate is 3.45% Japan interest rate is 3.16% US interest rate on 30 Yr fixed mortgage is 7.384% Colombia mortgage rate is 20.120% Consumer A wants to buy a $500k house. Most US banks offer a 30 year loan at 8-10% interest. Arbitrage company borrows $500k from Japanese bank at 4% fixed for 30 years. Then offers Consumer A 5.5% ARM with 30% down payment or 6.5% ARM with 20% down payment or 7% fixed with 10% down payment. Thesis - japans rates will remain low for the next 5 years, possibly 10 years. Requiring a 30% down payment provides a buffer in times of currency fluctuations and also helps to reduce the investment risk. The down payment also acts as a sort of vetting since few Americans have $1,000 saved up so the ones who have 30% saved up will be pretty safe borrowers in terms of risk. The 1.5-3% interest arbitrage also acts as a buffer. At scale, this could be packaged together and sold to retail and institutional bond investors and that spread would increase the company’s profits per sale. Lastly, homes in the US generally retain their value and due to housing supply shortages, there will be ample opportunities to liquidate. It seems that borrowing from foreign banks, regardless of the country, is incredibly hard. Most seem to only do business with their own citizens or people with long history in the country and are residents (green/residency card or passport). I’m in the U.S. and it seems pretty hard to get a loan from a Japan bank for instance. Chinese bank is even harder. I have never stepped foot in any of these countries yet.
