,"I'm just gonna list countries involved and tell you why they wouldn't want the unification of Korea. Everyone is asking what would happen to the economy if a war took place, so I thought this would be relevant. Japan- would fear the economy and military of a strong unified Korea -South Korea has already caught up in per capita GDP, and ranks #1 on the innovation index while Japan ranks #5. It will still be difficult for South Korea to catch up in gross GDP, unless (you guessed it) they merge with North Korea and increase their population and workforce aka FUCKKKK. Russia - would cause a strong US presence in the region -Obvious enough US - can continue to sell weapons to SK and Japan if the fear of NK remains -Japan, oue 9th largest guns customer, bought 93% of their arms from the US in 2016, $307M -SK, our 8th largest, only got 37% from the US, but that was still $501M South Korea- would be very expensive to unify -there are estimates that it could cost anywhere from $500B to $3T. The long term economic effects would be positive, but this would be an insanely huge blow in the short term. China -Would cause there to be troops near their border. Also, China is currently a buffer between North Korea and the US, ending that conflict would render that futile. Feel free to disagree and pick apart my thoughts. I've only spent an hour or so on this so I might be missing some things or just totally wrong. But let's keep it civil regardless and happy America day!","Your examples are all about why a reunification does not have appeal to some nations, and has nothing to do about IF a war would actually happen.It only takes one side to start a war, and I doubt if China or Russia much less the US have much if any influence over North Korea acting crazy. I don't expect a war to happen, but IMO you haven't made any case of why we shouldn't worry it.",0,0.517,NEGATIVE,0.73

Of course we could always just invade them destroy everything and leave, and you'd definitely be right in that scenario. It'll be interesting to see how it plays out.",1,0.513,NEGATIVE,0.513

That's happened in the past. I'm more talking about a full on dragged out war.",2,0.52,NEGATIVE,0.999

A unified Korea helps Japan in the long run. Technology transfer that has been on-going with South Korea gets extended to a unified Korea making Japan a bunch of money out of the deal. Plus, Japan is able to finally rid itself of that round-eye that's been hanging around since WWII.Russia -Russia gains a land border with the unified Korea (South Korea) and offers the ability to trade resources for finished products (cars, electronics, etc.). Huge win for Russia.South Korea -South Korea would gain access to natural resources, a low cost work force and direct land routes for trade with China and Russia. All the benefits of Germany's reunification would be visited on South Korea over 20-odd years.China -The main thing holding China back from supporting reunification revolves around the collapse of the former Soviet Union. They see any kind of Korea peninsula reunification as a harbinger of their own ""one party one china"" collapse. If the US/Japan/etc. could guarantee reunification without collapse, I guarantee you that China would be on board (with maybe some additional reassurances about the maritime borders and the eventual reunification of Taiwan with mainland China)US -The USA has a massive win from reunification. It gets to stop coddling an entire region and allows them to be responsible for their own defense requirements. Over the course of 10 years, maybe two trillion dollars would be saved by contracting the pacific bases and military presence. In addition, the USA gets nuclear disarmament out of the deal.",0,0.524,POSITIVE,0.99
