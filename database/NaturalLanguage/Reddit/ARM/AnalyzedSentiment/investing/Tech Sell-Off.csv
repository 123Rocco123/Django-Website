,"So, as it seems announcements about company takeovers (tiktok, ARM), brought a little bit of good sentiment back to the tech markets. I am wondering whether this is just super short-term, as it almost always is when takeovers are announced, or if this disrupted the tech selloff as a whole. I cannot image the mid/long term sentiment among investors has changed. The last two weeks were all about panicing retail investors & big money getting pulled out of the market. Sentiment among analysts as well as redditors was all dark, and terms like bubble burst, snowball selloff, market crash, ... were all over the place. How comes that as of today, nobody discusses the tech bubble selloff anymore? Isn't the broader market direction more interesting than 2 company takeovers?",Up until 2020 I thought people here had a clue. Buying and holding and never reading this subreddit would have made me much more money in the last five years.,0,0.521,NEGATIVE,1.0

There's a fair amount of people on here who have been negative for years; complaining when the market is up and when there's a time like March they are certain at the bottom that the market is going much lower. After a while, it starts to seem""The last two weeks were all about panicing retail investors & big money getting pulled out of the market""This wasn't panic by any means. The Nasdaq went back to where it was a month prior. Hyper growth names had had an extraordinary year - to expect those trees to grow to the moon wasn't realistic and the issue that happens (and it's happened a number of times in recent years), it's not a gradual 3 steps forward 2 steps back thing. Growth (and particularly hyper growth) felt like it was going up every day for most of the year. A pullback (and the recent pullback was mild) was healthy.""How comes that as of today, nobody discusses the tech bubble selloff anymore?""There's so many instances over the years where something goes down 1% and you get ""WHY IS X DOWN!!??!?!"" and it's like, nobody asked anything during when it went up 50%, but the moment it's down 1-2% and it's ""WHAT IS HAPPENING?""",0,0.539,NEGATIVE,1.0
