,"I’m looking at Air France KLM as an option because of its low market cap. The group is weighed down by massive debt they took during the pandemic. However operations are generating good cash flows. I can see this continuing, although there are serious challenges. Amsterdam airport looks set to further restrict the number of flights this year. It’s currently 483k a year, could drop another 5-10%. This is a blow to the group, although having the Air France arm does allow the group to flex operations away from AMS. Their future aircraft deliveries to KLM are all for higher capacity planes that should allow for some revenue growth even if flight numbers fall. KLM has also suggested they could delay new aircraft deliveries if flight numbers fall, which could improve cash flow. Both Netherlands and France are due to raise taxes and fees paid by airlines. However i’d say its likely that this can passed onto the consumer as we are still in a capacity constrained environment, with airlines not able to get enough planes. If you compare to similar airline groups, IAG has a very similar size fleet of aircraft and has a market cap 7(!) times that of AF KLM. Granted IAG has a much healthier balance sheet. But as outlined above, Air France KLM is generating cash so this should improve. Lastly, both the French and Dutch governments have stakes in the business, so would likely assist if required. Airlines are symbolic, and the loss of both names is hard to fathom. So at a market cap of €2Bn, for a massive (albeit debt riddled) business which is generating cash flows. Anyone else an investor or have thoughts?",Do they make any profit?,0,0.6,NEGATIVE,0.985

Plus, their revenue base is highly sensitive to geopolitics right now. Even the Israeli-Palestine conflict impacted the bottom line.Net debt is down to circa €5bn, which is expected to lower - a good long term sign.
