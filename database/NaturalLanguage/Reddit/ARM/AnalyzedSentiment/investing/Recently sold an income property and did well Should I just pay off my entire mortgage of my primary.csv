,"I’m a bit wary of putting cash into the market right now, so paying off the mortgage on my primary seems like the best idea. I was also thinking about only paying off 75% of it as I have a very low interest rate (3%) and investing the rest when the market bottoms out. Thoughts? Edit: thanks for all the comments y’all. This forum seems to be very evenly split across 3 options: Pay whole mortgage off Pay some mortgage off (including option to recast), invest some (50/50) Invest all (DCA/conservative investments) I went ahead and used 66% of the gain to pay down my mortgage and will invest 34% more in I-bonds, DCA, and another investment arm I have access to. This was close to my original plan and was somewhat validated by this forum. The house I am in right now as my primary is not my forever home, but my forever home will undoubtedly cost more so I’m comfortable putting a large sum of money towards the mortgage since that housing expense will be larger in the future when I eventually trade up anyway. Better to have more of a principal paid off for when I trade up in the future as well since interest rates on a future home will be sky high. (I live in the highest COL area in the world btw.) Another note I will make is that I didn’t have to pay cap gains on the gains from the sale of the income property because it was my primary for the first 2 of the last 5 years before I rented it out.","I was fortunate to have a similar situation a few years back and I paid off my mortgage. I love it, I sleep like a baby.Math says invest, but heck I’d do the same thing again in a heartbeat. I use my extra free cash flow to continue investing but I enjoy it now instead of feeling this personal pressure to perform.",0,0.517,POSITIVE,0.998

Sorry.)It really depends on risk tolerance. Paying off debt on primary means in a catastrophic scenario, you should be much better off. But in exchange, your total returns will be lower.If you are willing to take a higher risk, then yes investing could and historically has generated better returns. Will it in the future? Probably but we don't know. There have been ""lost decades"" where you see tons of volatility but total return is nil. It also depends on how you invest too as you could not only trail the other scenario if paying off debt but could lose principle.Another option, depending on where you are, would be to reinvest in real estate. If 1031 is an option, then you get to hold off on capital gains and save on the tax bill. Defer defer...Last thing to consider.. ""when the market bottoms out"" the only way you will ever know that is after it happens. So that would not be a great strategy to bet on. Instead I would look at just debt service vs investing. Then figure out how u wanna invest later if u choose that route.So I guess you need to figure out what is best for you based on your risk tolerance. Once you figure that out, the question gets much much easier.Good luck!None if this is financial advice even if it sounds like it. Just my perspective. I'm not an advisor. Not a fiduciary. I did stay at a holiday inn express last night so I got that going for me. When in doubt, find a fiduciary.",1,0.522,NEGATIVE,1.0

Money in the bank is always the best option in a catastrophic scenario. Let's say OP and significant other (if applicable) both lose their incomes. They have zero dollars coming in.Which scenario makes them better off?No/little money in the bank. No mortgage. 3k/month of other expenses that they now cannot pay.300k in the bank. $1800/mo mortgage. 3k/month of other expenses.Seems you would be in a much better situation if you didn't pay off your mortgage and had that money available to you to continue living off of until you can get your incomes back to where they were.Everyone told me to out 20% down instead of 10. I don't get it. If something were to happen, having my mortgage be 2000 instead of 2200 with no income doesn't make a difference. With no income I wouldn't be able to pay either. 200/mo less isn't going to help. An extra 40k in the bank sure would help me continue to pay while getting back on my feet.Hell I shouldn't have even put 10%. My rate is sub 3%. The bigger the loan at a rate like that the better.",2,0.515,NEGATIVE,1.0

We closed yesterday on our condo that we bought right after getting married 10 years ago. I’d been taking $150 a month from the money we were getting from the rent. My wife was giving me $75 a month and I was giving $125 a month. All put together it was the equivalent of an extra mortgage payment a month all going to principal. At the current pace I’ll have our current house paid off in 6 more years (bought it in 2016). Selling the condo and having no more rent would make a dent in that extra payment. I thought about just paying off the balance of my current mortgage. My interest rate is 3.75%. Then I decided to take the proceeds and drop it into a bond fund. If I dropped everything in it would give us about $450 a month of which I’d take the $225 to replace what I was getting from my wife and the rent and reinvest the rest of the dividends. Then I modified that to only throw a portion in the bond fund that would return just over $225 a month and put the rest in some of the growth stocks and let them work for a decade or so then gradually move them over to the bond fund. That’s my plan going into this coming week. So I could still end up changing my mind again.,3,0.518,NEGATIVE,0.911
