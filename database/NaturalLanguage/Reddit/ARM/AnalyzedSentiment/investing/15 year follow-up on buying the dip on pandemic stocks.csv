,"I was only planning on giving annual updates but opted to give this 18-month update, given the changes I made a couple of months ago to rebalance my portfolio. As a recap, I bought several ‘pandemic stocks’ following the dip in 2022. I gave a 1-year update in mid-2023 here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ I planned on holding all of them longer, but 1) the recent boom in AI forced me to consider a rebalance and 2) strong (IMO somewhat unjustified) continued appreciation gave me a good opportunity to exit. The timing was fortunate since there was a correction after I sold. Below is a summary of what I sold and the realized gain/loss. Summary There were multiple lots of some stocks, so I’ve summarized each with the overall realized gain at the time of the sale in Q3: Affirm (AFRM): +18.09% Allbirds (BIRD): +6.89% Coinbase (COIN): +6.42% Carvana (CVNA): +845.57% Peloton (PTON): -71.51% Snapchat (SNAP): -1.99% All realized gains/losses were long-term (capital gains rate) except Carvana (CVNA) and Allbirds (BIRD). I know these are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it. Though Peloton lost a significant amount of value, it was a relatively small investment and was more than offset by the unprecedented gains with Carvana (saved by the meme). How I reinvested the proceeds The AI boom drove this sale, and I reinvested the proceeds mostly in NVIDIA (NVDA). This was hard for me personally since I initially passed on buying NVIDIA at ~$110/share in October 2022 (I don’t know why), and at the time of the purchase, it was in the $400s following the strong run-up in 2023. Most analysts said it was overpriced and it’d have to perform perfectly to achieve anything near that valuation. However, working in tech broadly and with AI products in particular, my gut told me that there was still plenty of upside given their moat thanks to CUDA, among other things. So I pulled the trigger and purchased a significant amount of NVIDIA stock (all proceeds, plus more) and a smaller amount of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC). I passed on the Arm IPO, now down about 20% from its IPO peak. I tentatively plan to give the 2-year update in another 6 months, plus or minus. For reference, the 1-year update from earlier this year is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/ EDIT: Corrected a typo to change 2021 to 2022.
