,"Fund a compelling argument that people managing smaller portfolios should focus their research on smaller cap companies < 5b, even < 1bn. They usually only have 1 arm of business. Which makes it much easier to analyze. Larger institutions aren't allowed to enter some stocks that are below $5 (?). Even then it might not be worth their time to analyze such companies, as they can't even invest too much of their capital without taking up a lot of the float. One example I found was a fund invested something like a measly $300,000 into a uranium mining company (Forsys Metals Corp i think?), which caused the shares to increase by 30%. I heard 95% of micro cap stocks < 100 million are garbage, but 5% of them are actual diamonds in the rough and they do exist if you try to scout them out. Via looking at double digit revenue growth, a lot of insider trading, and an outstanding management team. Has anyone ever structured a portfolio that was based mostly off of just investing in small / micro cap stocks using a good buy criteria such as the above? How did it turn out?","Hi, welcome to r/investing.
