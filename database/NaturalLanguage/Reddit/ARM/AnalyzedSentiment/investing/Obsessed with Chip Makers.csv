,"I’ve been investing in chip makers, mostly via SMH, for about the last 12 months. My thesis at the time was that they are the ones selling shovels in a gold rush. I think that has proven true, and I think it will continue to be true for many years to come. The semiconductor market is projected to expand at a CAGR of 11% over the next five years, according to analysts. It is almost impossible to assemble a bear case for chips, with more devices needing more powerful chips every year. Chip production is diversifying in response to the pandemic bottlenecks. There is absolutely massive capital investment going on right now for new plants and supply chains in more locations. This eats into profits and cash flow, but makes the industry more resilient. Even with all that investment, the best chip makers are going to have incredible pricing power thanks to unyielding, insatiable demand. AI will be center stage when it comes to demand, but there are other demand shocks that could further bolster chipmakers pricing power, including a potential resurgence in crypto, the trend toward specialized encoder/decoder chips for things like AV1, the move towards ARM-based chips and a potential huge demand to churn old x86 devices in favor of more power efficient ARM devices, which could be helped along by Windows 12, a move towards local generative AI rather than cloud-based for privacy concerns, and on and on. Chip makers are already hyped up, but for the reasons above I am still buying, and will continue to buy for many years to come.",Chip makers tend to go through boom or bust cycles - the bust (and the bear case) comes from an over-capacity situation that follows a boom period when lots of people rush in to take advantage.,0,0.523,NEGATIVE,0.987

Cutting edge fabs cost up to $10 billion and 3 years (and the number is going up over time, with some future fabs potentially costing much more). The reason why busts are so costly in this industry is because corporate investment needs to predict demand several years out, and put that money to use today for what might happen globally in 5 years. Recessions, wars, supply chain issues, and simple business cycle shifts are hard to predict that far in advance, so there's an inherent gamble there.",1,0.54,POSITIVE,0.795

Fact is, generative models are coming down in size without loss in performance. Will there be a switch to ARM? Maybe, but, for what? A laptop from 2018 will still give 6 hours of battery life and plenty adequate performance. I could see a long term shift to ARM, but it would be gradual.

Right now any power semiconductor devices (converters, inverters, drives) which are critical to industrial systems, solar, and EVs are pretty much sold out. BUT Ford and GM just dropped EV production altogether (hybrids moving forward) with others likely to follow. Plus ARM and now RISC-V chips don’t require 3 nm fab. Older equipment is fine. Power semis also don’t need that although there is more demand than supply for wide bandgap semiconductors especially Si-C. But every chip company is building like crazy, so it is likely that in the near future they will overbuild and create an oversupply, which will collapse prices. You can’t exactly bet on specific players because although 3 nm and Si-C are game changers chip plants are highly a commodity market. I can upload designs to an aggregator and order custom chips by credit card if I want to make my own. It is literally that much of a commodity market. But for instance ARM chips are back in stock and most manufacturers are slowly improving delivery times.Many projects just launched in the last 2 years and with 3 years to hit the market most likely best case scenario is that demand goes down as supply meets demand reducing prices and margins even as production increases for some.
