,"So American Funds, the investment arm of Capital Group, shows a neat pie chart that breaks down the geographical content of different indexes not only by domicile, but also by revenue (see link below). As such you can see that the S&P 500 has become a global index with 38% of sales sourced abroad. Bridgewater showed this another way by demonstrating that US sales growth became less correlated with GDP growth as globalization happened, a result of sales depending on foreign growth. Since the S&P 500 is materially exposed to country/currency risk, what's the point of diversifying with other indexes such as the MSCI EAFE and MSCI EM? Aren't the diversification benefits lost if everybody is cross-selling to each other? https://www.capitalgroup.com/individual/investments/fund/agthx","Domestic companies are more heavily weighted towards tech, Healthcare, and other services where as international equity exposure will give you more traditional manufacturing. Also markets are sufficiently disconnected that international growth can and does disconnect from domestic growth for decade long periods or more.",0,0.566,NEGATIVE,0.961

The two are connected, but is it a simple 1:1 connection or something more complicated?I agree that globalization makes markets and economies much more connected, but that’s a far cry from being in lock step.",0,0.558,NEGATIVE,0.995

Typically with even higher percentages of revenue from outside their country. So according to your logic wouldn’t they be even better than the SP because they are more diversified?Here are some compelling reasons to invest in multiple country equity indices:Diversification of currency risk - US has been very fortunate to be the global reserve currency but that won’t necessarily last forever. Historically many countries have seen their currency significantly devalued relative to global currencies.Long term valuation cycles appear more favorable to ex US countries right now: If you compare long term average return of the US to exUS all of the outperformance has come in the recent bull market. US valuation levels are stretched particularly when compared to the rest of the world. Valuation tends to cycle and it appears that the US is at or nearing the peak of a cycle while exUS is nearing the bottom. It’s not guaranteed but based on history there is a high probability that the recent relative performance will revert.Low correlation over long term periods: If you limit your view to monthly or annual correlation you might conclude that international equities have very high correlation with the SP and provide no diversification. But over 5-10 year periods the correlation is very low to negative. This corresponds to long duration cycles of relative performance. International equity can and have outperformed the US for 5-10 year stretches.Diversification of political risk: Shifts in regulation, politics, and fiscal/tax policy can have a significant impact on country equity valuation and performance. Historical worst case scenarios have included complete loss of equity ownership. But just look at the current news to see how politics can impact equities: Turkey, Brexit, US/China “trade war”. To some extent globalization spreads the impact across countries, but at the extremes, being invested outside your country provides some protection (assuming you are still permitted to maintain ownership of financial assets, which is likely in the US for the foreseeable future.)",0,0.531,NEGATIVE,0.992
