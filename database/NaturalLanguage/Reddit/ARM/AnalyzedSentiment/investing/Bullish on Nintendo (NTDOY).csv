,"Nintendo's profits surged more than 240% in its fiscal quarter ending September 30th, as demand for the company's Switch console and Animal Crossing video game skyrocketed amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The Japanese video game company shipped more than 6.5 million Switch consoles in the quarter with Animal Crossing being the best title with 14.27 million sold. As of September, lifetime-to-date sales of the Switch consoles reached 68.3 million units worldwide. Demand for the Switch reached a record high in the wake of stay-at-home orders due to the pandemic, which also caused Nintendo to run into supply issues with the console due to factory shutdowns in China. Those closures triggered component shortages and slowed output for factories in Vietnam where the Switch is manufactured. As of now, there is still a shortage of both versions of the Switch at major retailers around the globe. I believe the company can transform into one that’s able to roll out incremental new platforms while retaining its user base. Hit products such as the Wii were often followed by much less successful ones, such as the disastrous Wii U. With each new console, Nintendo rolled the dice on making the new machine a success, and while it got things right this generation with the Switch, a successor console would have no guarantee of similar sales. With every console generation, the install base resets to zero and their earnings power essentially resets to zero. Nintendo can break free by releasing a new and more powerful iteration of the Switch every few years. They can continuously have an install base of say 100 million consoles out there, that just moves along over time. Going forward I predict they will create 3 lines of devices that will reach a broad line of customers while maintaining the incremental updates. Switch Lite, Switch, and the upcoming Switch Pro. That kind of perpetual platform model already exists: Apple Inc.’s iPhone. Like the smartphone, new versions of the Switch could be backwards-compatible with all games released so far while becoming more powerful and feature-rich. They have used Nvidia's arm chips to ensure their software (games) will always work with every Switch that comes out. That would keep customers locked into Nintendo’s entertainment ecosystem on top of its exclusive first-party titles while making profits and sales more predictable. Also don't forget, Nintendo gets 5%-10% of revenue from everything that isn't Switch-related, depending on what quarter or year is being looked at. Nintendo management, traditionally secretive about future plans, has hinted that it wants to change its dependency on a single console going forward. Here are a few things we know are coming: Theme parks. Nintendo is partnering with Universal to build Super Nintendo World parks in Japan, Florida, California, and Singapore. Like Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge at Disney parks, Super Nintendo World is meant to be a 100% immersive experience where visitors feel like they are in one of Nintendo's games. Construction started on the Japan park in 2017, and it is supposed to be open in 2021, depending on what happens with COVID-19.  Video entertainment. With the rise of streaming budgets and modern animation technology, Nintendo has started partnering/licensing its IP for movie and TV production. A Super Mario Bros. film from the makers of Despicable Me is supposed to come out in 2022. It will be animated (as opposed to the trainwreck 1993 version) and focused on a family audience. A Legend of Zelda movie has been rumored to be coming to Netflix, although nothing material has been announced so far. Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa said in the future visual content may not be limited to just film, and that Nintendo's main goal is to invest in entertainment to attract new fans to its content.  Hybrid physical and digital games. Movies and theme parks may be the largest opportunity for Nintendo, but investors shouldn't forget physical games and toys. For example, the company just released Mario Kart: Home Circuit, where users not only race cars and characters on a screen but also with a physical racing track. In the end, we need to stop thinking of Nintendo as just a gaming company and more as an entertainment company.","Hi, welcome to r/investing.

I’d like to see your reasoning for that.Smartphones are much more engrained as a way of life. The iPhone is a fashion statement and has a cult like following. The cameras are upgraded every year and with everyone addicted to social media that drives upgrades too. Lastly they have built in payment plan and upgrade plan options.Do you think Nintendo could offer serious motivations to regularly upgrade a switch? To my eyes, even as someone who desperately looked and drove pretty far to pick one up this summer, it’s the type of thing you don’t really upgrade for a while because the games that are played on it aren’t really graphically intense, and they’re mostly laid back, meant to be played relaxed (so I don’t see much advantage to adding, say, accelerometers and turning it into a mini Wii).I just don’t know if I see this vision of Nintendo as a company that can start selling incremental Switch upgrades every few years",0,0.524,NEGATIVE,0.997

Nintendo doesn't need people to upgrade in order to gain their business anymore. They are going to focus on keeping them in the ecosystem with different ways inside and outside the Switch. Such as more software and services.With that being said, I do think Nintendo will release one more hardware before this new trend of increment updates for the Switch. So yes I do agree the iPhone comparison is valid. Nintendo will have 3 different hardware to choose from with the new Switch Pro coming out in March 2021. Switch lite will be the low end, Switch will be the mid-teir and Switch Pro will be high end.

I believe lockdown pulled in a ton of on-the-fence buyers, while simultaneously reducing the pool of future buyers moving forward. The people that wanted the Switch are basically accounted for at this point, and the stream of first-party games has really slowed down. Now when someone wants to buy a system, they'll be cross shopping with the latest batch of consoles, one of which is priced exactly like the Switch. Portability is their one remaining value proposition and online doesn't seem to be a priority for Nintendo, despite it's massive success in the Sony and Microsoft ecosystems.I honestly just don't see the growth story anymore and if I were forced to make a choice, I'd likely opt to short it.",0,0.517,NEGATIVE,1.0

Nintendo can break free by releasing a new and more powerful iteration of the Switch every few years. They can continuously have an install base of say 100 million consoles out there, that just moves along over time.

Demand for the Switch reached a record high in the wake of stay-at-home orders due to the pandemic, which also caused Nintendo to run into supply issues with the console due to factory shutdowns in China. Those closures triggered component shortages and slowed output for factories in Vietnam where the Switch is manufactured. As of now, there is still a shortage of both versions of the Switch at major retailers around the globe. I believe the company can transform into one that’s able to roll out incremental new platforms while retaining its user base. Hit products such as the Wii were often followed by much less successful ones, such as the disastrous Wii U. With each new console, Nintendo rolled the dice on making the new machine a success, and while it got things right this generation with the Switch, a successor console would have no guarantee of similar sales. With every console generation, the install base resets to zero and their earnings power essentially resets to zero. Nintendo can break free by releasing a new and more powerful iteration of the Switch every few years. They can continuously have an install base of say 100 million consoles out there, that just moves along over time. Going forward I predict they will create 3 lines of devices that will reach a broad line of customers while maintaining the incremental updates. Switch Lite, Switch, and the upcoming Switch Pro. That kind of perpetual platform model already exists: Apple Inc.’s iPhone.

They have used Nvidia's arm chips to ensure their software (games) will always work with every Switch that comes out. That would keep customers locked into Nintendo’s entertainment ecosystem on top of its exclusive first-party titles while making profits and sales more predictable.

Demand for the Switch reached a record high in the wake of stay-at-home orders due to the pandemic, which also caused Nintendo to run into supply issues with the console due to factory shutdowns in China. Those closures triggered component shortages and slowed output for factories in Vietnam where the Switch is manufactured. As of now, there is still a shortage of both versions of the Switch at major retailers around the globe. I believe the company can transform into one that’s able to roll out incremental new platforms while retaining its user base. Hit products such as the Wii were often followed by much less successful ones, such as the disastrous Wii U. With each new console, Nintendo rolled the dice on making the new machine a success, and while it got things right this generation with the Switch, a successor console would have no guarantee of similar sales. With every console generation, the install base resets to zero and their earnings power essentially resets to zero. Nintendo can break free by releasing a new and more powerful iteration of the Switch every few years. They can continuously have an install base of say 100 million consoles out there, that just moves along over time. Going forward I predict they will create 3 lines of devices that will reach a broad line of customers while maintaining the incremental updates. Switch Lite, Switch, and the upcoming Switch Pro. That kind of perpetual platform model already exists: Apple Inc.’s iPhone. Like the smartphone, new versions of the Switch could be backwards-compatible with all games released so far while becoming more powerful and feature-rich. They have used Nvidia's arm chips to ensure their software (games) will always work with every Switch that comes out. That would keep customers locked into Nintendo’s entertainment ecosystem on top of its exclusive first-party titles while making profits and sales more predictable. Also don't forget, Nintendo gets 5%-10% of revenue from everything that isn't Switch-related, depending on what quarter or year is being looked at. Nintendo management, traditionally secretive about future plans, has hinted that it wants to change its dependency on a single console going forward. Here are a few things we know are coming: Theme parks. Nintendo is partnering with Universal to build Super Nintendo World parks in Japan, Florida, California, and Singapore. Like Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge at Disney parks, Super Nintendo World is meant to be a 100% immersive experience where visitors feel like they are in one of Nintendo's games. Construction started on the Japan park in 2017, and it is supposed to be open in 2021, depending on what happens with COVID-19.  Video entertainment. With the rise of streaming budgets and modern animation technology, Nintendo has started partnering/licensing its IP for movie and TV production. A Super Mario Bros. film from the makers of Despicable Me is supposed to come out in 2022. It will be animated (as opposed to the trainwreck 1993 version) and focused on a family audience. A Legend of Zelda movie has been rumored to be coming to Netflix, although nothing material has been announced so far. Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa said in the future visual content may not be limited to just film, and that Nintendo's main goal is to invest in entertainment to attract new fans to its content.  Hybrid physical and digital games. Movies and theme parks may be the largest opportunity for Nintendo, but investors shouldn't forget physical games and toys. For example, the company just released Mario Kart: Home Circuit, where users not only race cars and characters on a screen but also with a physical racing track. In the end, we need to stop thinking of Nintendo as just a gaming company and more as an entertainment company.",I mean Pokémon Go generated $1 billion USD with in-app purchases in 2020 so far....,2,0.517,NEGATIVE,0.654
