,"YTD, Ishares US Aerospace & Defense ETF is ""up"" .19% (so basically 0), but in comparison with the rest of the market tanking -13%, this is a great position to be in. This lack of a crash in comparison to the rest of the market (while there is never a guarantee of anything), serves as an example of an industry that (so far) isn't being influenced by bearish sentiments and rake hikes. ITA also has yet to return to it's ATHs prior to the March 2020 crash, meaning that it did not experience the hyper bubble and burst of the fed printing money from 2020-2022. For me personally, I believe this means that either 1. should a full on market crash occur, ITA is currently priced at the same equivalent level as to where the rest of the market SHOULD be valued at, meaning a crash wont see it suffer significant prices drops, or 2. Price inflation that other assets have experienced have yet to make its way into the industry. The companies within ITA are solid and aren't going anywhere. The weakest link currently is Boeing, which has suffered an unfortunate Earnings reports in the last 3 quarters, which is why I believe the ITA is lower than the ETF would otherwise be valued at. While these companies are not overwhelmingly raking in the dough in comparison to hardware and software companies such as AMD and MSFT. More broadly speculating - The United States isn't shrinking its Defense spending anytime soon, and with the world beginning to transition back to multipolar world, and some trends of globalization reversing, the potential of armed conflict and the rate of armed conflict could likely increase. R&D industry serves both as a bullish pro-American industry to invest in, while simultaneously acting as a hedge against current market make ups in the event global conflict occurs. It also offers exposure to space exploration innovation should that become a reality in the future. TL;DR: - Solid Companies lead the A&D industry - A&D has yet to recover from 2020 ATH, never inflated during the 2021 bubble, and never dropped during the 2022 crash, suggesting it may trend upwards during an otherwise sidewise market. - Global world order is shifting away inch by inch from interconnected market capitalism, which will increase the odds of conflict. - US is still a leader in A&D, and has no plans of decreasing its budget as western nations become more reliant on the US for defense - for more speculative reasons, A&D also offers exposure to potential expansions of space exploration should that become a reality in our lifetime.","I like aerospace long term but ITA isn’t very well diversified for a broad industry etf. I believe almost 40% is made up by Raytheon + Lockheed so you better really like those companies.Long term, I’d be somewhat concerned about Comac poaching some single aisle business from Boeing but I think Boeing has much bigger immediate problems than that.",0,0.534,NEGATIVE,1.0

Additionally due to this fact they have relatively low profit margins.A good measure of current value is comparing these companies to their historic PE ratios.

,"YTD, Ishares US Aerospace & Defense ETF is ""up"" .19% (so basically 0), but in comparison with the rest of the market tanking -13%, this is a great position to be in. This lack of a crash in comparison to the rest of the market (while there is never a guarantee of anything), serves as an example of an industry that (so far) isn't being influenced by bearish sentiments and rake hikes. ITA also has yet to return to it's ATHs prior to the March 2020 crash, meaning that it did not experience the hyper bubble and burst of the fed printing money from 2020-2022. For me personally, I believe this means that either 1. should a full on market crash occur, ITA is currently priced at the same equivalent level as to where the rest of the market SHOULD be valued at, meaning a crash wont see it suffer significant prices drops, or 2. Price inflation that other assets have experienced have yet to make its way into the industry. The companies within ITA are solid and aren't going anywhere. The weakest link currently is Boeing, which has suffered an unfortunate Earnings reports in the last 3 quarters, which is why I believe the ITA is lower than the ETF would otherwise be valued at. While these companies are not overwhelmingly raking in the dough in comparison to hardware and software companies such as AMD and MSFT. More broadly speculating - The United States isn't shrinking its Defense spending anytime soon, and with the world beginning to transition back to multipolar world, and some trends of globalization reversing, the potential of armed conflict and the rate of armed conflict could likely increase. R&D industry serves both as a bullish pro-American industry to invest in, while simultaneously acting as a hedge against current market make ups in the event global conflict occurs. It also offers exposure to space exploration innovation should that become a reality in the future. TL;DR: - Solid Companies lead the A&D industry - A&D has yet to recover from 2020 ATH, never inflated during the 2021 bubble, and never dropped during the 2022 crash, suggesting it may trend upwards during an otherwise sidewise market. - Global world order is shifting away inch by inch from interconnected market capitalism, which will increase the odds of conflict. - US is still a leader in A&D, and has no plans of decreasing its budget as western nations become more reliant on the US for defense - for more speculative reasons, A&D also offers exposure to potential expansions of space exploration should that become a reality in our lifetime.","Your submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for r/investing.
