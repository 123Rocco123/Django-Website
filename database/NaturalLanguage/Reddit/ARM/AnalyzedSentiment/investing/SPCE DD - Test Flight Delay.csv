,"Hello all! Test flight has been delay...so what? This is a long play. You can turn around and make good money off the space tourism but truthfully, this play is meant for the hypersonic point-to-point travel that will be coming to fruition sometime near 2025 pioneered by Virgin Galactic with the help of NASA, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. Let's talk most recent timeline: December 12 2020: The test flight didn't go as planned, a software issue prevented the rocket from igniting. What can we take away from this? Truthfully, this became a more bullish signal and the charts reflect that. A large concern with this company was ""what if it blows up?"". This ""failed"" test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn't succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch. Following this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. February 13 2021: The test flight was delayed, and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit Friday morning and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. February 2021: I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic. Q1 2021: The Q3 Earnings Presentation outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane: This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&V elements. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2) Once Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson. The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. Surviving to 2025: This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year. There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date. Beyond 2025: Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market. Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little: Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN Let's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share What's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism. Let's look at Space Tourism, the predicted market cap is $3BN, which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. Beyond 2030: Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci: The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities. One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us: While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear. Let's Talk Technology: VMS Eve is the name of the WhiteKnightTwo mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. SpaceShipTwo is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. The cabin has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology. Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce unveiled the Mach 3 design which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. On a large private jet: $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. In my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry. Key Staff and Players: Founder - Sir Richard Branson: Founder of the Virgin Group (Virgin Mobile, Virgin Atlantic, etc.) CEO - Michael Colglazier: Former President and Managing Director of Disney Parks International CTO (Chief Space Officer) - George Whitesides: Former Chief of Staff NASA CFO - Jon Campagna: Former Corporate Controller of ICON Aircraft Inc. Noteworthy Investors: Vanguard Bank of America Morgan Stanley ARK Boeing Chamath Palihapitiya (Also a Virgin Galactic Chairman) Cathie Wood (presumably through ARKK) Partners: Boeing ( investor/hopes to be a part of the hypersonic point-to-point travel ) Rolls Royce ( designing and developing engine propulsion technology for high speed commercial aircraft as well as interior design ) NASA ( a plethora of tasks including transportation to the ISS, research, and hypersonic point-to-point travel ) Lockheed Martin ( developer of the Supersonic X-59 plane which will be used for testing hypersonic travel ) Under Armour (suits) Bear Case: What if it explodes? As I stated before the last test flight to me demonstrated that the fail safes in place will prevent this from happening and the chart reflects that notion. Aside from that, I hate to be that guy, but fatalities are expected with companies especially in emerging technologies. Remember when Tesla decapitated someone? Or the growing list of Airline incidents? Or how about when a Remington trigger malfunction killed hundreds? While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company. Virgin Galactic had a fatality in 2014 and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets. SpaceX: This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his hypersonic capabilities for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth. It is a hype driven stock: This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations. The price right now is pure hype and speculation on what Virgin Galactic COULD become. Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit. I think this will remain hyped for a very long time as I mentioned early, most investors aren't here for space tourism. Space tourism is the PayPal, hypersonic flight is the Tesla.

This isn't some new technology, it's a revolution in human travel. Watch carefully this week. The test flight was delayed and that news was announced ATH on Friday. It is possible that we see a sell-off happen at market open. I don't know how long the sell-off will go or how big of an impact this will have. In the past delays and issues made the price plummet, however, there are new long term investors who might not even flinch at this news. This week is a buying opportunity.

But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities. One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us: While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear. Let's Talk Technology: VMS Eve is the name of the WhiteKnightTwo mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. SpaceShipTwo is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. The cabin has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology. Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce unveiled the Mach 3 design which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. On a large private jet: $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. In my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry.

Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his hypersonic capabilities for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth.

,"Hello all! Test flight has been delay...so what? This is a long play. You can turn around and make good money off the space tourism but truthfully, this play is meant for the hypersonic point-to-point travel that will be coming to fruition sometime near 2025 pioneered by Virgin Galactic with the help of NASA, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. Let's talk most recent timeline: December 12 2020: The test flight didn't go as planned, a software issue prevented the rocket from igniting. What can we take away from this? Truthfully, this became a more bullish signal and the charts reflect that. A large concern with this company was ""what if it blows up?"". This ""failed"" test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn't succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch. Following this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. February 13 2021: The test flight was delayed, and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit Friday morning and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. February 2021: I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic. Q1 2021: The Q3 Earnings Presentation outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane: This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&V elements. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2) Once Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson. The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. Surviving to 2025: This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year. There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date. Beyond 2025: Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market. Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little: Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN Let's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share What's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism. Let's look at Space Tourism, the predicted market cap is $3BN, which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. Beyond 2030: Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci: The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability.

(I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2) Once Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson. The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding.

Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. Surviving to 2025: This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year. There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well.

Beyond 2025: Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market. Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little: Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN Let's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share What's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism. Let's look at Space Tourism, the predicted market cap is $3BN, which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. Beyond 2030: Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci: The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities. One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us: While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential.

Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology. Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce unveiled the Mach 3 design which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. On a large private jet: $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method.

While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company. Virgin Galactic had a fatality in 2014 and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets. SpaceX: This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his hypersonic capabilities for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth. It is a hype driven stock: This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations. The price right now is pure hype and speculation on what Virgin Galactic COULD become. Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit.

,"Hello all! Test flight has been delay...so what? This is a long play. You can turn around and make good money off the space tourism but truthfully, this play is meant for the hypersonic point-to-point travel that will be coming to fruition sometime near 2025 pioneered by Virgin Galactic with the help of NASA, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. Let's talk most recent timeline: December 12 2020: The test flight didn't go as planned, a software issue prevented the rocket from igniting. What can we take away from this? Truthfully, this became a more bullish signal and the charts reflect that. A large concern with this company was ""what if it blows up?"". This ""failed"" test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn't succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch. Following this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. February 13 2021: The test flight was delayed, and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit Friday morning and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. February 2021: I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic. Q1 2021: The Q3 Earnings Presentation outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane: This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&V elements.

While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company. Virgin Galactic had a fatality in 2014 and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets. SpaceX: This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his hypersonic capabilities for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth. It is a hype driven stock: This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations.

Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit.

We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane: This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&V elements. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2) Once Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson. The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. Surviving to 2025: This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year. There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date. Beyond 2025: Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market. Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little: Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN Let's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share What's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism. Let's look at Space Tourism, the predicted market cap is $3BN, which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. Beyond 2030: Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci: The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities. One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us: While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear. Let's Talk Technology: VMS Eve is the name of the WhiteKnightTwo mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. SpaceShipTwo is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. The cabin has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology. Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce unveiled the Mach 3 design which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. On a large private jet: $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. In my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry.

SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share What's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism. Let's look at Space Tourism, the predicted market cap is $3BN, which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. Beyond 2030: Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci: The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities. One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us: While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear. Let's Talk Technology: VMS Eve is the name of the WhiteKnightTwo mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. SpaceShipTwo is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. The cabin has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology. Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce unveiled the Mach 3 design which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. On a large private jet: $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. In my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry.

Aside from that, I hate to be that guy, but fatalities are expected with companies especially in emerging technologies. Remember when Tesla decapitated someone? Or the growing list of Airline incidents? Or how about when a Remington trigger malfunction killed hundreds? While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company. Virgin Galactic had a fatality in 2014 and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets. SpaceX: This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his hypersonic capabilities for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth. It is a hype driven stock: This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations. The price right now is pure hype and speculation on what Virgin Galactic COULD become. Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit. I think this will remain hyped for a very long time as I mentioned early, most investors aren't here for space tourism. Space tourism is the PayPal, hypersonic flight is the Tesla.

,"Hello all! Test flight has been delay...so what? This is a long play. You can turn around and make good money off the space tourism but truthfully, this play is meant for the hypersonic point-to-point travel that will be coming to fruition sometime near 2025 pioneered by Virgin Galactic with the help of NASA, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. Let's talk most recent timeline: December 12 2020: The test flight didn't go as planned, a software issue prevented the rocket from igniting. What can we take away from this? Truthfully, this became a more bullish signal and the charts reflect that. A large concern with this company was ""what if it blows up?"". This ""failed"" test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn't succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch. Following this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. February 13 2021: The test flight was delayed, and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit Friday morning and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. February 2021: I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic. Q1 2021: The Q3 Earnings Presentation outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane: This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&V elements. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2) Once Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson. The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. Surviving to 2025: This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year. There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date. Beyond 2025: Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market. Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little: Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN Let's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market.

,"Hello all! Test flight has been delay...so what? This is a long play. You can turn around and make good money off the space tourism but truthfully, this play is meant for the hypersonic point-to-point travel that will be coming to fruition sometime near 2025 pioneered by Virgin Galactic with the help of NASA, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. Let's talk most recent timeline: December 12 2020: The test flight didn't go as planned, a software issue prevented the rocket from igniting. What can we take away from this? Truthfully, this became a more bullish signal and the charts reflect that. A large concern with this company was ""what if it blows up?"". This ""failed"" test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn't succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch. Following this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. February 13 2021: The test flight was delayed, and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit Friday morning and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. February 2021: I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic. Q1 2021: The Q3 Earnings Presentation outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane: This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&V elements. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2) Once Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson. The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. Surviving to 2025: This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year. There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date. Beyond 2025: Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market. Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little: Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN Let's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share What's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism. Let's look at Space Tourism, the predicted market cap is $3BN, which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. Beyond 2030: Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci: The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities. One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us: While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear. Let's Talk Technology: VMS Eve is the name of the WhiteKnightTwo mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. SpaceShipTwo is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. The cabin has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology. Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce unveiled the Mach 3 design which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. On a large private jet: $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. In my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry. Key Staff and Players: Founder - Sir Richard Branson: Founder of the Virgin Group (Virgin Mobile, Virgin Atlantic, etc.) CEO - Michael Colglazier: Former President and Managing Director of Disney Parks International CTO (Chief Space Officer) - George Whitesides: Former Chief of Staff NASA CFO - Jon Campagna: Former Corporate Controller of ICON Aircraft Inc. Noteworthy Investors: Vanguard Bank of America Morgan Stanley ARK Boeing Chamath Palihapitiya (Also a Virgin Galactic Chairman) Cathie Wood (presumably through ARKK) Partners: Boeing ( investor/hopes to be a part of the hypersonic point-to-point travel ) Rolls Royce ( designing and developing engine propulsion technology for high speed commercial aircraft as well as interior design ) NASA ( a plethora of tasks including transportation to the ISS, research, and hypersonic point-to-point travel ) Lockheed Martin ( developer of the Supersonic X-59 plane which will be used for testing hypersonic travel ) Under Armour (suits) Bear Case: What if it explodes? As I stated before the last test flight to me demonstrated that the fail safes in place will prevent this from happening and the chart reflects that notion. Aside from that, I hate to be that guy, but fatalities are expected with companies especially in emerging technologies. Remember when Tesla decapitated someone? Or the growing list of Airline incidents? Or how about when a Remington trigger malfunction killed hundreds? While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company. Virgin Galactic had a fatality in 2014 and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets. SpaceX: This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his hypersonic capabilities for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth. It is a hype driven stock: This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations. The price right now is pure hype and speculation on what Virgin Galactic COULD become. Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit. I think this will remain hyped for a very long time as I mentioned early, most investors aren't here for space tourism. Space tourism is the PayPal, hypersonic flight is the Tesla.

Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear. Let's Talk Technology: VMS Eve is the name of the WhiteKnightTwo mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. SpaceShipTwo is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. The cabin has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology. Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce unveiled the Mach 3 design which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. On a large private jet: $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. In my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry.

Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his hypersonic capabilities for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth.

,"Hello all! Test flight has been delay...so what? This is a long play. You can turn around and make good money off the space tourism but truthfully, this play is meant for the hypersonic point-to-point travel that will be coming to fruition sometime near 2025 pioneered by Virgin Galactic with the help of NASA, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. Let's talk most recent timeline: December 12 2020: The test flight didn't go as planned, a software issue prevented the rocket from igniting. What can we take away from this? Truthfully, this became a more bullish signal and the charts reflect that. A large concern with this company was ""what if it blows up?"". This ""failed"" test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn't succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch. Following this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. February 13 2021: The test flight was delayed, and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit Friday morning and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. February 2021: I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic. Q1 2021: The Q3 Earnings Presentation outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane: This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&V elements. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2) Once Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson. The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. Surviving to 2025: This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year. There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date. Beyond 2025: Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market. Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little: Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN Let's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share What's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism. Let's look at Space Tourism, the predicted market cap is $3BN, which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. Beyond 2030: Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci: The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities. One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us: While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential.

It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&V elements. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2) Once Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson. The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. Surviving to 2025: This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year. There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date. Beyond 2025: Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market. Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little: Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN Let's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share What's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism. Let's look at Space Tourism, the predicted market cap is $3BN, which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. Beyond 2030: Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci: The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities. One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us: While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear. Let's Talk Technology: VMS Eve is the name of the WhiteKnightTwo mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. SpaceShipTwo is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. The cabin has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology. Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce unveiled the Mach 3 design which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. On a large private jet: $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. In my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry.

Noteworthy Investors: Vanguard Bank of America Morgan Stanley ARK Boeing Chamath Palihapitiya (Also a Virgin Galactic Chairman) Cathie Wood (presumably through ARKK) Partners: Boeing ( investor/hopes to be a part of the hypersonic point-to-point travel ) Rolls Royce ( designing and developing engine propulsion technology for high speed commercial aircraft as well as interior design ) NASA ( a plethora of tasks including transportation to the ISS, research, and hypersonic point-to-point travel ) Lockheed Martin ( developer of the Supersonic X-59 plane which will be used for testing hypersonic travel ) Under Armour (suits) Bear Case: What if it explodes? As I stated before the last test flight to me demonstrated that the fail safes in place will prevent this from happening and the chart reflects that notion. Aside from that, I hate to be that guy, but fatalities are expected with companies especially in emerging technologies. Remember when Tesla decapitated someone? Or the growing list of Airline incidents? Or how about when a Remington trigger malfunction killed hundreds? While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company. Virgin Galactic had a fatality in 2014 and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets. SpaceX: This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his hypersonic capabilities for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth. It is a hype driven stock: This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations. The price right now is pure hype and speculation on what Virgin Galactic COULD become. Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit. I think this will remain hyped for a very long time as I mentioned early, most investors aren't here for space tourism. Space tourism is the PayPal, hypersonic flight is the Tesla.

,"Hello all! Test flight has been delay...so what? This is a long play. You can turn around and make good money off the space tourism but truthfully, this play is meant for the hypersonic point-to-point travel that will be coming to fruition sometime near 2025 pioneered by Virgin Galactic with the help of NASA, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. Let's talk most recent timeline: December 12 2020: The test flight didn't go as planned, a software issue prevented the rocket from igniting. What can we take away from this? Truthfully, this became a more bullish signal and the charts reflect that. A large concern with this company was ""what if it blows up?"". This ""failed"" test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn't succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch. Following this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. February 13 2021: The test flight was delayed, and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit Friday morning and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. February 2021: I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February.

Virgin Galactic had a fatality in 2014 and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets. SpaceX: This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his hypersonic capabilities for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth.

,"Hello all! Test flight has been delay...so what? This is a long play. You can turn around and make good money off the space tourism but truthfully, this play is meant for the hypersonic point-to-point travel that will be coming to fruition sometime near 2025 pioneered by Virgin Galactic with the help of NASA, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. Let's talk most recent timeline: December 12 2020: The test flight didn't go as planned, a software issue prevented the rocket from igniting. What can we take away from this? Truthfully, this became a more bullish signal and the charts reflect that. A large concern with this company was ""what if it blows up?"". This ""failed"" test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn't succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch. Following this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. February 13 2021: The test flight was delayed, and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit Friday morning and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. February 2021: I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic. Q1 2021: The Q3 Earnings Presentation outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane: This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&V elements. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2) Once Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson. The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. Surviving to 2025: This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year. There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date. Beyond 2025: Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market. Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little: Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN Let's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share What's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism. Let's look at Space Tourism, the predicted market cap is $3BN, which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. Beyond 2030: Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci: The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities. One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us: While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear. Let's Talk Technology: VMS Eve is the name of the WhiteKnightTwo mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. SpaceShipTwo is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. The cabin has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology. Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce unveiled the Mach 3 design which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. On a large private jet: $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. In my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry.

Let's look at Space Tourism, the predicted market cap is $3BN, which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. Beyond 2030: Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci: The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities. One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us: While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear. Let's Talk Technology: VMS Eve is the name of the WhiteKnightTwo mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. SpaceShipTwo is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. The cabin has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology. Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce unveiled the Mach 3 design which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. On a large private jet: $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. In my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry.

While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company. Virgin Galactic had a fatality in 2014 and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets. SpaceX: This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his hypersonic capabilities for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth. It is a hype driven stock: This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations. The price right now is pure hype and speculation on what Virgin Galactic COULD become. Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit. I think this will remain hyped for a very long time as I mentioned early, most investors aren't here for space tourism. Space tourism is the PayPal, hypersonic flight is the Tesla.

,"Hello all! Test flight has been delay...so what? This is a long play. You can turn around and make good money off the space tourism but truthfully, this play is meant for the hypersonic point-to-point travel that will be coming to fruition sometime near 2025 pioneered by Virgin Galactic with the help of NASA, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. Let's talk most recent timeline: December 12 2020: The test flight didn't go as planned, a software issue prevented the rocket from igniting. What can we take away from this? Truthfully, this became a more bullish signal and the charts reflect that. A large concern with this company was ""what if it blows up?"". This ""failed"" test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn't succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch. Following this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. February 13 2021: The test flight was delayed, and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit Friday morning and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. February 2021: I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic. Q1 2021: The Q3 Earnings Presentation outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane: This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&V elements. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2) Once Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson. The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. Surviving to 2025: This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year. There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date. Beyond 2025: Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market. Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little: Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN Let's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market.

You can turn around and make good money off the space tourism but truthfully, this play is meant for the hypersonic point-to-point travel that will be coming to fruition sometime near 2025 pioneered by Virgin Galactic with the help of NASA, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. Let's talk most recent timeline: December 12 2020: The test flight didn't go as planned, a software issue prevented the rocket from igniting. What can we take away from this? Truthfully, this became a more bullish signal and the charts reflect that. A large concern with this company was ""what if it blows up?"". This ""failed"" test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn't succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch. Following this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. February 13 2021: The test flight was delayed, and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit Friday morning and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. February 2021: I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic. Q1 2021: The Q3 Earnings Presentation outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane: This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&V elements. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2) Once Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson. The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. Surviving to 2025: This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year. There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date. Beyond 2025: Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market. Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little: Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN Let's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share What's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism. Let's look at Space Tourism, the predicted market cap is $3BN, which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. Beyond 2030: Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci: The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities. One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us: While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear. Let's Talk Technology: VMS Eve is the name of the WhiteKnightTwo mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. SpaceShipTwo is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. The cabin has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology. Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce unveiled the Mach 3 design which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. On a large private jet: $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. In my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry.

Noteworthy Investors: Vanguard Bank of America Morgan Stanley ARK Boeing Chamath Palihapitiya (Also a Virgin Galactic Chairman) Cathie Wood (presumably through ARKK) Partners: Boeing ( investor/hopes to be a part of the hypersonic point-to-point travel ) Rolls Royce ( designing and developing engine propulsion technology for high speed commercial aircraft as well as interior design ) NASA ( a plethora of tasks including transportation to the ISS, research, and hypersonic point-to-point travel ) Lockheed Martin ( developer of the Supersonic X-59 plane which will be used for testing hypersonic travel ) Under Armour (suits) Bear Case: What if it explodes? As I stated before the last test flight to me demonstrated that the fail safes in place will prevent this from happening and the chart reflects that notion. Aside from that, I hate to be that guy, but fatalities are expected with companies especially in emerging technologies. Remember when Tesla decapitated someone? Or the growing list of Airline incidents? Or how about when a Remington trigger malfunction killed hundreds? While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company. Virgin Galactic had a fatality in 2014 and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets. SpaceX: This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his hypersonic capabilities for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth. It is a hype driven stock: This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations. The price right now is pure hype and speculation on what Virgin Galactic COULD become. Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit. I think this will remain hyped for a very long time as I mentioned early, most investors aren't here for space tourism. Space tourism is the PayPal, hypersonic flight is the Tesla.

Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce unveiled the Mach 3 design which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. On a large private jet: $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. In my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry.

While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company. Virgin Galactic had a fatality in 2014 and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets. SpaceX: This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his hypersonic capabilities for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth. It is a hype driven stock: This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations. The price right now is pure hype and speculation on what Virgin Galactic COULD become. Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit. I think this will remain hyped for a very long time as I mentioned early, most investors aren't here for space tourism. Space tourism is the PayPal, hypersonic flight is the Tesla.

,"Hello all! Test flight has been delay...so what? This is a long play. You can turn around and make good money off the space tourism but truthfully, this play is meant for the hypersonic point-to-point travel that will be coming to fruition sometime near 2025 pioneered by Virgin Galactic with the help of NASA, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. Let's talk most recent timeline: December 12 2020: The test flight didn't go as planned, a software issue prevented the rocket from igniting. What can we take away from this? Truthfully, this became a more bullish signal and the charts reflect that. A large concern with this company was ""what if it blows up?"". This ""failed"" test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn't succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch. Following this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. February 13 2021: The test flight was delayed, and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit Friday morning and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. February 2021: I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic. Q1 2021: The Q3 Earnings Presentation outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane: This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&V elements. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2) Once Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson. The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. Surviving to 2025: This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year. There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date. Beyond 2025: Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market. Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little: Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN Let's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share What's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism. Let's look at Space Tourism, the predicted market cap is $3BN, which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. Beyond 2030: Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci: The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities. One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us: While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear. Let's Talk Technology: VMS Eve is the name of the WhiteKnightTwo mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. SpaceShipTwo is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. The cabin has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology.

Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date. Beyond 2025: Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market. Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little: Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN Let's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share What's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism. Let's look at Space Tourism, the predicted market cap is $3BN, which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. Beyond 2030: Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci: The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities. One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us: While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear. Let's Talk Technology: VMS Eve is the name of the WhiteKnightTwo mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. SpaceShipTwo is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. The cabin has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology. Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce unveiled the Mach 3 design which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. On a large private jet: $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. In my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry.

,"Hello all! Test flight has been delay...so what? This is a long play. You can turn around and make good money off the space tourism but truthfully, this play is meant for the hypersonic point-to-point travel that will be coming to fruition sometime near 2025 pioneered by Virgin Galactic with the help of NASA, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. Let's talk most recent timeline: December 12 2020: The test flight didn't go as planned, a software issue prevented the rocket from igniting. What can we take away from this? Truthfully, this became a more bullish signal and the charts reflect that. A large concern with this company was ""what if it blows up?"". This ""failed"" test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn't succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch. Following this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. February 13 2021: The test flight was delayed, and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit Friday morning and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. February 2021: I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic. Q1 2021: The Q3 Earnings Presentation outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane: This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&V elements. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2) Once Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson. The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. Surviving to 2025: This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year. There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date.

This isn't some new technology, it's a revolution in human travel. Watch carefully this week. The test flight was delayed and that news was announced ATH on Friday. It is possible that we see a sell-off happen at market open. I don't know how long the sell-off will go or how big of an impact this will have. In the past delays and issues made the price plummet, however, there are new long term investors who might not even flinch at this news. This week is a buying opportunity. If this DD was too long and the video DD was also too long check out the Too Long Didn't Watch (TL;DW) video here: TL;DW Video DD","This same post is getting pasted all over Reddit. There is definitely a push to pump this stock. I posted the below on another thread, but I am not buying the hype. Someone needs to show me where the profits are in the next decade.:I have some (past) experience in this industry and am just not sold on SPCE. They might make some money (small profits years down the road) as a space tourist Uber driver, but they are not even in the discussion with organizations like ULA and now SpaceX. ULA makes astronomical amounts of profit everytime they conduct a launch for the govenment. I think Blue Origin is going to make some noise in the coming years, but they are very, very cautious and will not bring anything to market until they are 100% certain of success. This is the opposite of the approach SpaceX has taken (successfully).For those interested in launch companies, do some research on national security launch and who is paying for this service (i.e. US Air Force/Space Force, NGA, NRO, etc) The cost of these contracts is exponentially higher than a private sector launch since failure is not an option on national security payloads and governments will pay the price for guaranteed success. As thrilling as space exploration is, the near/medium term laumch money is in national security contracts.I think the companies executing current national security launches will continue to dominate the market. SpaceX is just starting to tap this market and there is nobidy else close behind them. Basically it is ULA and SpaceX at this point.Definitely not a financial expert, just someone interested in space stocks that isnt buying the hype of this meme stock.",0,0.529,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Hello all! Test flight has been delay...so what? This is a long play. You can turn around and make good money off the space tourism but truthfully, this play is meant for the hypersonic point-to-point travel that will be coming to fruition sometime near 2025 pioneered by Virgin Galactic with the help of NASA, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. Let's talk most recent timeline: December 12 2020: The test flight didn't go as planned, a software issue prevented the rocket from igniting. What can we take away from this? Truthfully, this became a more bullish signal and the charts reflect that. A large concern with this company was ""what if it blows up?"". This ""failed"" test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn't succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch. Following this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. February 13 2021: The test flight was delayed, and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit Friday morning and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. February 2021: I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic. Q1 2021: The Q3 Earnings Presentation outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane: This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&V elements. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2) Once Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson. The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. Surviving to 2025: This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year. There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date. Beyond 2025: Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market. Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little: Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN Let's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share What's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism. Let's look at Space Tourism, the predicted market cap is $3BN, which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. Beyond 2030: Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci: The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities. One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us: While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear. Let's Talk Technology: VMS Eve is the name of the WhiteKnightTwo mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. SpaceShipTwo is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. The cabin has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology. Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce unveiled the Mach 3 design which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. On a large private jet: $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. In my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry. Key Staff and Players: Founder - Sir Richard Branson: Founder of the Virgin Group (Virgin Mobile, Virgin Atlantic, etc.) CEO - Michael Colglazier: Former President and Managing Director of Disney Parks International CTO (Chief Space Officer) - George Whitesides: Former Chief of Staff NASA CFO - Jon Campagna: Former Corporate Controller of ICON Aircraft Inc. Noteworthy Investors: Vanguard Bank of America Morgan Stanley ARK Boeing Chamath Palihapitiya (Also a Virgin Galactic Chairman) Cathie Wood (presumably through ARKK) Partners: Boeing ( investor/hopes to be a part of the hypersonic point-to-point travel ) Rolls Royce ( designing and developing engine propulsion technology for high speed commercial aircraft as well as interior design ) NASA ( a plethora of tasks including transportation to the ISS, research, and hypersonic point-to-point travel ) Lockheed Martin ( developer of the Supersonic X-59 plane which will be used for testing hypersonic travel ) Under Armour (suits) Bear Case: What if it explodes? As I stated before the last test flight to me demonstrated that the fail safes in place will prevent this from happening and the chart reflects that notion. Aside from that, I hate to be that guy, but fatalities are expected with companies especially in emerging technologies. Remember when Tesla decapitated someone? Or the growing list of Airline incidents? Or how about when a Remington trigger malfunction killed hundreds? While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company. Virgin Galactic had a fatality in 2014 and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets. SpaceX: This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his hypersonic capabilities for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth. It is a hype driven stock: This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations. The price right now is pure hype and speculation on what Virgin Galactic COULD become. Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit. I think this will remain hyped for a very long time as I mentioned early, most investors aren't here for space tourism. Space tourism is the PayPal, hypersonic flight is the Tesla.

Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities. One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us: While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear. Let's Talk Technology: VMS Eve is the name of the WhiteKnightTwo mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. SpaceShipTwo is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. The cabin has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology. Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce unveiled the Mach 3 design which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. On a large private jet: $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. In my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry.

As I stated before the last test flight to me demonstrated that the fail safes in place will prevent this from happening and the chart reflects that notion. Aside from that, I hate to be that guy, but fatalities are expected with companies especially in emerging technologies. Remember when Tesla decapitated someone? Or the growing list of Airline incidents? Or how about when a Remington trigger malfunction killed hundreds? While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company. Virgin Galactic had a fatality in 2014 and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets. SpaceX: This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his hypersonic capabilities for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth. It is a hype driven stock: This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations. The price right now is pure hype and speculation on what Virgin Galactic COULD become. Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit. I think this will remain hyped for a very long time as I mentioned early, most investors aren't here for space tourism. Space tourism is the PayPal, hypersonic flight is the Tesla.

,"Hello all! Test flight has been delay...so what? This is a long play. You can turn around and make good money off the space tourism but truthfully, this play is meant for the hypersonic point-to-point travel that will be coming to fruition sometime near 2025 pioneered by Virgin Galactic with the help of NASA, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. Let's talk most recent timeline: December 12 2020: The test flight didn't go as planned, a software issue prevented the rocket from igniting. What can we take away from this? Truthfully, this became a more bullish signal and the charts reflect that. A large concern with this company was ""what if it blows up?"". This ""failed"" test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn't succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch. Following this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. February 13 2021: The test flight was delayed, and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit Friday morning and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. February 2021: I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic. Q1 2021: The Q3 Earnings Presentation outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane: This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&V elements. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2) Once Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson. The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. Surviving to 2025: This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year. There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date. Beyond 2025: Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market. Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little: Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN Let's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share What's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism. Let's look at Space Tourism, the predicted market cap is $3BN, which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. Beyond 2030: Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci: The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there.

Following this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. February 13 2021: The test flight was delayed, and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit Friday morning and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. February 2021: I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic. Q1 2021: The Q3 Earnings Presentation outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane: This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&V elements. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2) Once Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson. The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. Surviving to 2025: This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year. There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date. Beyond 2025: Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market. Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little: Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN Let's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share What's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism. Let's look at Space Tourism, the predicted market cap is $3BN, which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. Beyond 2030: Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci: The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities. One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us: While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear. Let's Talk Technology: VMS Eve is the name of the WhiteKnightTwo mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. SpaceShipTwo is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. The cabin has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology. Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce unveiled the Mach 3 design which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. On a large private jet: $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. In my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry. Key Staff and Players: Founder - Sir Richard Branson: Founder of the Virgin Group (Virgin Mobile, Virgin Atlantic, etc.) CEO - Michael Colglazier: Former President and Managing Director of Disney Parks International CTO (Chief Space Officer) - George Whitesides: Former Chief of Staff NASA CFO - Jon Campagna: Former Corporate Controller of ICON Aircraft Inc. Noteworthy Investors: Vanguard Bank of America Morgan Stanley ARK Boeing Chamath Palihapitiya (Also a Virgin Galactic Chairman) Cathie Wood (presumably through ARKK) Partners: Boeing ( investor/hopes to be a part of the hypersonic point-to-point travel ) Rolls Royce ( designing and developing engine propulsion technology for high speed commercial aircraft as well as interior design ) NASA ( a plethora of tasks including transportation to the ISS, research, and hypersonic point-to-point travel ) Lockheed Martin ( developer of the Supersonic X-59 plane which will be used for testing hypersonic travel ) Under Armour (suits) Bear Case: What if it explodes? As I stated before the last test flight to me demonstrated that the fail safes in place will prevent this from happening and the chart reflects that notion. Aside from that, I hate to be that guy, but fatalities are expected with companies especially in emerging technologies. Remember when Tesla decapitated someone? Or the growing list of Airline incidents? Or how about when a Remington trigger malfunction killed hundreds? While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company. Virgin Galactic had a fatality in 2014 and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets. SpaceX: This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his hypersonic capabilities for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth. It is a hype driven stock: This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations. The price right now is pure hype and speculation on what Virgin Galactic COULD become. Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit. I think this will remain hyped for a very long time as I mentioned early, most investors aren't here for space tourism. Space tourism is the PayPal, hypersonic flight is the Tesla.

Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. Surviving to 2025: This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year. There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date. Beyond 2025: Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market. Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little: Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN Let's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share What's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism. Let's look at Space Tourism, the predicted market cap is $3BN, which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. Beyond 2030: Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci: The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities. One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us: While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear. Let's Talk Technology: VMS Eve is the name of the WhiteKnightTwo mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. SpaceShipTwo is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. The cabin has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology. Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce unveiled the Mach 3 design which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. On a large private jet: $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method.

Let's play with this number for a little: Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN Let's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share What's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism. Let's look at Space Tourism, the predicted market cap is $3BN, which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. Beyond 2030: Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci: The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities. One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us: While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear. Let's Talk Technology: VMS Eve is the name of the WhiteKnightTwo mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. SpaceShipTwo is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. The cabin has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology. Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce unveiled the Mach 3 design which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. On a large private jet: $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. In my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry. Key Staff and Players: Founder - Sir Richard Branson: Founder of the Virgin Group (Virgin Mobile, Virgin Atlantic, etc.) CEO - Michael Colglazier: Former President and Managing Director of Disney Parks International CTO (Chief Space Officer) - George Whitesides: Former Chief of Staff NASA CFO - Jon Campagna: Former Corporate Controller of ICON Aircraft Inc. Noteworthy Investors: Vanguard Bank of America Morgan Stanley ARK Boeing Chamath Palihapitiya (Also a Virgin Galactic Chairman) Cathie Wood (presumably through ARKK) Partners: Boeing ( investor/hopes to be a part of the hypersonic point-to-point travel ) Rolls Royce ( designing and developing engine propulsion technology for high speed commercial aircraft as well as interior design ) NASA ( a plethora of tasks including transportation to the ISS, research, and hypersonic point-to-point travel ) Lockheed Martin ( developer of the Supersonic X-59 plane which will be used for testing hypersonic travel ) Under Armour (suits) Bear Case: What if it explodes? As I stated before the last test flight to me demonstrated that the fail safes in place will prevent this from happening and the chart reflects that notion. Aside from that, I hate to be that guy, but fatalities are expected with companies especially in emerging technologies. Remember when Tesla decapitated someone? Or the growing list of Airline incidents? Or how about when a Remington trigger malfunction killed hundreds? While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company. Virgin Galactic had a fatality in 2014 and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets. SpaceX: This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his hypersonic capabilities for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth. It is a hype driven stock: This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations. The price right now is pure hype and speculation on what Virgin Galactic COULD become. Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit. I think this will remain hyped for a very long time as I mentioned early, most investors aren't here for space tourism. Space tourism is the PayPal, hypersonic flight is the Tesla.

,"Hello all! Test flight has been delay...so what? This is a long play. You can turn around and make good money off the space tourism but truthfully, this play is meant for the hypersonic point-to-point travel that will be coming to fruition sometime near 2025 pioneered by Virgin Galactic with the help of NASA, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. Let's talk most recent timeline: December 12 2020: The test flight didn't go as planned, a software issue prevented the rocket from igniting. What can we take away from this? Truthfully, this became a more bullish signal and the charts reflect that. A large concern with this company was ""what if it blows up?"". This ""failed"" test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn't succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch. Following this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. February 13 2021: The test flight was delayed, and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit Friday morning and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. February 2021: I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic. Q1 2021: The Q3 Earnings Presentation outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane: This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&V elements. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2) Once Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson. The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. Surviving to 2025: This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year. There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date.

,"Hello all! Test flight has been delay...so what? This is a long play. You can turn around and make good money off the space tourism but truthfully, this play is meant for the hypersonic point-to-point travel that will be coming to fruition sometime near 2025 pioneered by Virgin Galactic with the help of NASA, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. Let's talk most recent timeline: December 12 2020: The test flight didn't go as planned, a software issue prevented the rocket from igniting. What can we take away from this? Truthfully, this became a more bullish signal and the charts reflect that. A large concern with this company was ""what if it blows up?"". This ""failed"" test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn't succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch. Following this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. February 13 2021: The test flight was delayed, and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit Friday morning and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. February 2021: I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic. Q1 2021: The Q3 Earnings Presentation outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane: This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&V elements. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2) Once Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson. The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. Surviving to 2025: This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year. There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date. Beyond 2025: Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market. Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little: Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN Let's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share What's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism. Let's look at Space Tourism, the predicted market cap is $3BN, which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. Beyond 2030: Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci: The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities. One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us: While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear. Let's Talk Technology: VMS Eve is the name of the WhiteKnightTwo mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. SpaceShipTwo is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. The cabin has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology. Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce unveiled the Mach 3 design which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. On a large private jet: $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. In my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry. Key Staff and Players: Founder - Sir Richard Branson: Founder of the Virgin Group (Virgin Mobile, Virgin Atlantic, etc.) CEO - Michael Colglazier: Former President and Managing Director of Disney Parks International CTO (Chief Space Officer) - George Whitesides: Former Chief of Staff NASA CFO - Jon Campagna: Former Corporate Controller of ICON Aircraft Inc. Noteworthy Investors: Vanguard Bank of America Morgan Stanley ARK Boeing Chamath Palihapitiya (Also a Virgin Galactic Chairman) Cathie Wood (presumably through ARKK) Partners: Boeing ( investor/hopes to be a part of the hypersonic point-to-point travel ) Rolls Royce ( designing and developing engine propulsion technology for high speed commercial aircraft as well as interior design ) NASA ( a plethora of tasks including transportation to the ISS, research, and hypersonic point-to-point travel ) Lockheed Martin ( developer of the Supersonic X-59 plane which will be used for testing hypersonic travel ) Under Armour (suits) Bear Case: What if it explodes? As I stated before the last test flight to me demonstrated that the fail safes in place will prevent this from happening and the chart reflects that notion. Aside from that, I hate to be that guy, but fatalities are expected with companies especially in emerging technologies. Remember when Tesla decapitated someone? Or the growing list of Airline incidents? Or how about when a Remington trigger malfunction killed hundreds? While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company. Virgin Galactic had a fatality in 2014 and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets. SpaceX: This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his hypersonic capabilities for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth. It is a hype driven stock: This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations. The price right now is pure hype and speculation on what Virgin Galactic COULD become. Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit. I think this will remain hyped for a very long time as I mentioned early, most investors aren't here for space tourism. Space tourism is the PayPal, hypersonic flight is the Tesla.

SpaceShipTwo is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. The cabin has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology. Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce unveiled the Mach 3 design which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. On a large private jet: $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. In my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry.

Noteworthy Investors: Vanguard Bank of America Morgan Stanley ARK Boeing Chamath Palihapitiya (Also a Virgin Galactic Chairman) Cathie Wood (presumably through ARKK) Partners: Boeing ( investor/hopes to be a part of the hypersonic point-to-point travel ) Rolls Royce ( designing and developing engine propulsion technology for high speed commercial aircraft as well as interior design ) NASA ( a plethora of tasks including transportation to the ISS, research, and hypersonic point-to-point travel ) Lockheed Martin ( developer of the Supersonic X-59 plane which will be used for testing hypersonic travel ) Under Armour (suits) Bear Case: What if it explodes? As I stated before the last test flight to me demonstrated that the fail safes in place will prevent this from happening and the chart reflects that notion. Aside from that, I hate to be that guy, but fatalities are expected with companies especially in emerging technologies. Remember when Tesla decapitated someone? Or the growing list of Airline incidents? Or how about when a Remington trigger malfunction killed hundreds? While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company. Virgin Galactic had a fatality in 2014 and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets. SpaceX: This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his hypersonic capabilities for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth. It is a hype driven stock: This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations. The price right now is pure hype and speculation on what Virgin Galactic COULD become. Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit. I think this will remain hyped for a very long time as I mentioned early, most investors aren't here for space tourism. Space tourism is the PayPal, hypersonic flight is the Tesla.

,"Hello all! Test flight has been delay...so what? This is a long play. You can turn around and make good money off the space tourism but truthfully, this play is meant for the hypersonic point-to-point travel that will be coming to fruition sometime near 2025 pioneered by Virgin Galactic with the help of NASA, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. Let's talk most recent timeline: December 12 2020: The test flight didn't go as planned, a software issue prevented the rocket from igniting. What can we take away from this? Truthfully, this became a more bullish signal and the charts reflect that. A large concern with this company was ""what if it blows up?"". This ""failed"" test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn't succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch. Following this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. February 13 2021: The test flight was delayed, and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit Friday morning and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. February 2021: I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic. Q1 2021: The Q3 Earnings Presentation outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane: This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&V elements. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2) Once Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson. The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. Surviving to 2025: This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year. There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date. Beyond 2025: Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market. Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little: Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN Let's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share What's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism. Let's look at Space Tourism, the predicted market cap is $3BN, which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. Beyond 2030: Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci: The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities. One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us: While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear.

Surviving to 2025: This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year. There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date. Beyond 2025: Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market. Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little: Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN Let's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share What's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism. Let's look at Space Tourism, the predicted market cap is $3BN, which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. Beyond 2030: Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci: The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities. One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us: While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear. Let's Talk Technology: VMS Eve is the name of the WhiteKnightTwo mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. SpaceShipTwo is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. The cabin has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology. Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce unveiled the Mach 3 design which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. On a large private jet: $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. In my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry.

Or the growing list of Airline incidents? Or how about when a Remington trigger malfunction killed hundreds? While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company. Virgin Galactic had a fatality in 2014 and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets. SpaceX: This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his hypersonic capabilities for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth. It is a hype driven stock: This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations. The price right now is pure hype and speculation on what Virgin Galactic COULD become. Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit. I think this will remain hyped for a very long time as I mentioned early, most investors aren't here for space tourism. Space tourism is the PayPal, hypersonic flight is the Tesla.

,"Hello all! Test flight has been delay...so what? This is a long play. You can turn around and make good money off the space tourism but truthfully, this play is meant for the hypersonic point-to-point travel that will be coming to fruition sometime near 2025 pioneered by Virgin Galactic with the help of NASA, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. Let's talk most recent timeline: December 12 2020: The test flight didn't go as planned, a software issue prevented the rocket from igniting. What can we take away from this? Truthfully, this became a more bullish signal and the charts reflect that. A large concern with this company was ""what if it blows up?"". This ""failed"" test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn't succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch. Following this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. February 13 2021: The test flight was delayed, and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit Friday morning and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. February 2021: I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic. Q1 2021: The Q3 Earnings Presentation outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane: This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&V elements. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2) Once Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson. The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling.

Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his hypersonic capabilities for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth. It is a hype driven stock: This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations. The price right now is pure hype and speculation on what Virgin Galactic COULD become. Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit. I think this will remain hyped for a very long time as I mentioned early, most investors aren't here for space tourism. Space tourism is the PayPal, hypersonic flight is the Tesla.

,"Hello all! Test flight has been delay...so what? This is a long play. You can turn around and make good money off the space tourism but truthfully, this play is meant for the hypersonic point-to-point travel that will be coming to fruition sometime near 2025 pioneered by Virgin Galactic with the help of NASA, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. Let's talk most recent timeline: December 12 2020: The test flight didn't go as planned, a software issue prevented the rocket from igniting. What can we take away from this? Truthfully, this became a more bullish signal and the charts reflect that. A large concern with this company was ""what if it blows up?"". This ""failed"" test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn't succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch. Following this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. February 13 2021: The test flight was delayed, and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit Friday morning and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. February 2021: I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic. Q1 2021: The Q3 Earnings Presentation outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane: This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&V elements. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2) Once Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson. The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. Surviving to 2025: This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year. There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date. Beyond 2025: Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market. Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little: Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN Let's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share What's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism. Let's look at Space Tourism, the predicted market cap is $3BN, which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. Beyond 2030: Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci: The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities. One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us: While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear. Let's Talk Technology: VMS Eve is the name of the WhiteKnightTwo mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. SpaceShipTwo is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. The cabin has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology. Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce unveiled the Mach 3 design which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. On a large private jet: $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. In my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry.

As I stated before the last test flight to me demonstrated that the fail safes in place will prevent this from happening and the chart reflects that notion. Aside from that, I hate to be that guy, but fatalities are expected with companies especially in emerging technologies. Remember when Tesla decapitated someone? Or the growing list of Airline incidents? Or how about when a Remington trigger malfunction killed hundreds? While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company.

Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities. One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us: While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear. Let's Talk Technology: VMS Eve is the name of the WhiteKnightTwo mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. SpaceShipTwo is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. The cabin has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology. Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce unveiled the Mach 3 design which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. On a large private jet: $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. In my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry. Key Staff and Players: Founder - Sir Richard Branson: Founder of the Virgin Group (Virgin Mobile, Virgin Atlantic, etc.) CEO - Michael Colglazier: Former President and Managing Director of Disney Parks International CTO (Chief Space Officer) - George Whitesides: Former Chief of Staff NASA CFO - Jon Campagna: Former Corporate Controller of ICON Aircraft Inc. Noteworthy Investors: Vanguard Bank of America Morgan Stanley ARK Boeing Chamath Palihapitiya (Also a Virgin Galactic Chairman) Cathie Wood (presumably through ARKK) Partners: Boeing ( investor/hopes to be a part of the hypersonic point-to-point travel ) Rolls Royce ( designing and developing engine propulsion technology for high speed commercial aircraft as well as interior design ) NASA ( a plethora of tasks including transportation to the ISS, research, and hypersonic point-to-point travel ) Lockheed Martin ( developer of the Supersonic X-59 plane which will be used for testing hypersonic travel ) Under Armour (suits) Bear Case: What if it explodes? As I stated before the last test flight to me demonstrated that the fail safes in place will prevent this from happening and the chart reflects that notion. Aside from that, I hate to be that guy, but fatalities are expected with companies especially in emerging technologies. Remember when Tesla decapitated someone? Or the growing list of Airline incidents? Or how about when a Remington trigger malfunction killed hundreds? While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company. Virgin Galactic had a fatality in 2014 and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets. SpaceX: This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his hypersonic capabilities for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth. It is a hype driven stock: This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations. The price right now is pure hype and speculation on what Virgin Galactic COULD become. Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit. I think this will remain hyped for a very long time as I mentioned early, most investors aren't here for space tourism. Space tourism is the PayPal, hypersonic flight is the Tesla. Thank you all for reading, if you don't want to actually read this check out the video DD: Video DD TL;DR: Space tourism is the start, hypersonic point-to-point travel is the golden nugget. This isn't some new technology, it's a revolution in human travel. Watch carefully this week. The test flight was delayed and that news was announced ATH on Friday. It is possible that we see a sell-off happen at market open. I don't know how long the sell-off will go or how big of an impact this will have. In the past delays and issues made the price plummet, however, there are new long term investors who might not even flinch at this news. This week is a buying opportunity. If this DD was too long and the video DD was also too long check out the Too Long Didn't Watch (TL;DW) video here: TL;DW Video DD","My bear case is:Engineering Concerns: Virgin Galactic has been in existence for nearly two decades and has two successful sub-orbital flights under its belt. That's not great considering that what they're doing isn't particularly novel, the USAF was successfully testing space planes 60 years ago. Virgin Galactic's approach of going partway up with a conventional plane is unique but it's unclear if this actually provides any sort of tangible advantage or benefit, and it does greatly increase the complexity of launches. Overall their engineering team do not have much in the way of actualized successes to point to.Space Tourism: While this could prove to be a reliable revenue stream, I'm skeptical regarding how large this is industry is actually going to be. There aren't that many people willing to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to spend a few minutes in suborbital space. Just for comparison, Mount Everest sees fewer than 1000 climbers per year and the South Pole sees fewer than 1000 tourists per year. I could be wrong but I still think this is very speculative.Hypersonic Travel: This seems enormously speculative. Virgin Galactic hasn't announced any sort of expected timetable, cost, milestones, etc. and it's not clear what their actual value-add would be (so far it seems like Rolls-Royce is the one actually innovating here). And given that Virgin Galactic doesn't exactly have a strong engineering track record to point to, I'm not confident that they're going to be able to build a meaningful moat. Especially given that there may be other players such as Boom, HyperMach, and JAXA. And even if Virgin Galactic does somehow end up as the only firm to successfully operate a supersonic airliner, it's not clear that it would be commercially successful (see: Concorde).",0,0.531,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Hello all! Test flight has been delay...so what? This is a long play. You can turn around and make good money off the space tourism but truthfully, this play is meant for the hypersonic point-to-point travel that will be coming to fruition sometime near 2025 pioneered by Virgin Galactic with the help of NASA, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. Let's talk most recent timeline: December 12 2020: The test flight didn't go as planned, a software issue prevented the rocket from igniting. What can we take away from this? Truthfully, this became a more bullish signal and the charts reflect that. A large concern with this company was ""what if it blows up?"". This ""failed"" test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn't succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch. Following this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. February 13 2021: The test flight was delayed, and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit Friday morning and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. February 2021: I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic. Q1 2021: The Q3 Earnings Presentation outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane: This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&V elements. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2) Once Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson. The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. Surviving to 2025: This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year. There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date. Beyond 2025: Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market. Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little: Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN Let's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share What's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism. Let's look at Space Tourism, the predicted market cap is $3BN, which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. Beyond 2030: Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci: The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there.

If this DD was too long and the video DD was also too long check out the Too Long Didn't Watch (TL;DW) video here: TL;DW Video DD","My perspective on these concerns:Engineering: The benefit of launching from 50,000 feet is you don’t need to use nearly as much fuel to create the thrust required to reach space. The airplane design would allow this craft to launch from any traditional airport. I don’t think it’s fair to say this is a engineering flaw since it’s a relatively new concept. Once the design is perfected it’s possible that another company sees how they do it and they do it better, I agree on that point, but this is quite novel.Space Tourism: it is certainly speculation how this industry will take off, so far over 600 people have purchased tickets and that number would be much, much larger however SPCE stopped selling tickets until they get these final test flights under their belt. The next year or so will be them running the already purchased flights. I don’t think that’s a fair comparison, Mt. Everest costs around $120k for a full custom climb and that’s climbing Mt. Everest. Like that’s not for everyone, that is difficult, long, and extremely dangerous. I’m actually super impressed that they see even 1000 climbers per year. Same notion for the South Pole. This will be easy. You as the tourist get into the ship, you go up, you come back down, you’re now an astronaut. Even if it only sees 1000 per year as well that’s $250M/yr in revenue. Their expectations are much higher as they are predicting $1B/spaceport/year.Hypersonic Travel: Concorde isn’t good, there is no good way to fly this fast over any landmass. It needs to have an altitude of 60,000+ for this to work. There are other players in the space, my opinion is SPCE is leading the charge and will be successful here. But even if you assume they share this market with 4 other companies then that would be the part of my DD where I say imagine they control 20% of the market. That’s still $230/share without any other revenue streams baked in.",1,0.541,POSITIVE,0.708

When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his hypersonic capabilities for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth. It is a hype driven stock: This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations. The price right now is pure hype and speculation on what Virgin Galactic COULD become. Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit. I think this will remain hyped for a very long time as I mentioned early, most investors aren't here for space tourism. Space tourism is the PayPal, hypersonic flight is the Tesla.

This isn't some new technology, it's a revolution in human travel. Watch carefully this week. The test flight was delayed and that news was announced ATH on Friday.

In the past delays and issues made the price plummet, however, there are new long term investors who might not even flinch at this news. This week is a buying opportunity. If this DD was too long and the video DD was also too long check out the Too Long Didn't Watch (TL;DW) video here: TL;DW Video DD","The benefit of launching from 50,000 feet is you don’t need to use nearly as much fuel to create the thrust required to reach space.Do you have anything that shows how much fuel they're saving? My intuition is that any fuel savings would be negligible (getting up to sub-orbital space doesn't require a massive amount of fuel anyways) but I'm open to opposing evidence.I don’t think it’s fair to say this is a engineering flaw since it’s a relatively new concept.It's not really a new concept. Like I pointed out, the USAF was doing basically the same thing 60 years ago. I take back what I said about Virgin Galactic's approach being unique, it's really not new at all now that I think about it.Concorde isn’t good, there is no good way to fly this fast over any landmass.Understand that the reason the Concorde failed wasn't because of restrictive flight paths, it's because it was too expensive for what was offered. The Concorde was fast, but very expensive and you're stuck in a cramped seat. In contrast, traditional international business class you pay less, the flight takes longer, but you get a nice lay-down seat and a bunch of other perks. Turns out most people prefer the latter, especially now that in-flight internet is a thing so you can stay in touch even while in the air.But even if you assume they share this market with 4 other companies then that would be the part of my DD where I say imagine they control 20% of the market. That’s still $230/share without any other revenue streams baked in.Keep in mind that none of these companies, including SPCE, are getting into the hypersonic travel market as defined by that ARK Analyst. You seem to be under the impression that a Mach 3 aircraft could travel around the globe in 90 minutes which isn't the case. And it's not going to have the fuel capacity to do that anyways.

,"Hello all! Test flight has been delay...so what? This is a long play. You can turn around and make good money off the space tourism but truthfully, this play is meant for the hypersonic point-to-point travel that will be coming to fruition sometime near 2025 pioneered by Virgin Galactic with the help of NASA, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. Let's talk most recent timeline: December 12 2020: The test flight didn't go as planned, a software issue prevented the rocket from igniting. What can we take away from this? Truthfully, this became a more bullish signal and the charts reflect that. A large concern with this company was ""what if it blows up?"". This ""failed"" test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn't succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch. Following this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. February 13 2021: The test flight was delayed, and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit Friday morning and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. February 2021: I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic. Q1 2021: The Q3 Earnings Presentation outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane: This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&V elements. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2) Once Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson. The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. Surviving to 2025: This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year. There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date. Beyond 2025: Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market. Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little: Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN Let's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share What's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism. Let's look at Space Tourism, the predicted market cap is $3BN, which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. Beyond 2030: Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci: The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities. One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us: While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear. Let's Talk Technology: VMS Eve is the name of the WhiteKnightTwo mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. SpaceShipTwo is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. The cabin has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology. Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce unveiled the Mach 3 design which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. On a large private jet: $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. In my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry. Key Staff and Players: Founder - Sir Richard Branson: Founder of the Virgin Group (Virgin Mobile, Virgin Atlantic, etc.) CEO - Michael Colglazier: Former President and Managing Director of Disney Parks International CTO (Chief Space Officer) - George Whitesides: Former Chief of Staff NASA CFO - Jon Campagna: Former Corporate Controller of ICON Aircraft Inc. Noteworthy Investors: Vanguard Bank of America Morgan Stanley ARK Boeing Chamath Palihapitiya (Also a Virgin Galactic Chairman) Cathie Wood (presumably through ARKK) Partners: Boeing ( investor/hopes to be a part of the hypersonic point-to-point travel ) Rolls Royce ( designing and developing engine propulsion technology for high speed commercial aircraft as well as interior design ) NASA ( a plethora of tasks including transportation to the ISS, research, and hypersonic point-to-point travel ) Lockheed Martin ( developer of the Supersonic X-59 plane which will be used for testing hypersonic travel ) Under Armour (suits) Bear Case: What if it explodes? As I stated before the last test flight to me demonstrated that the fail safes in place will prevent this from happening and the chart reflects that notion. Aside from that, I hate to be that guy, but fatalities are expected with companies especially in emerging technologies. Remember when Tesla decapitated someone? Or the growing list of Airline incidents? Or how about when a Remington trigger malfunction killed hundreds? While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company. Virgin Galactic had a fatality in 2014 and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets. SpaceX: This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor.

In 2000, 113 people were killed. But there is a large misconception here that a lot of people make. Hypersonic and supersonic are two different things. Concorde (supersonic) was able to make a trip from NYC to London in 3.5 hours. Terribly for the environment because of the massive fuel burn but an impressive aircraft especially for its time. Sub-orbital travel would allow you to travel from London to Sydney under an hour. We are talking crossing the globe in under an hour. Not only that but supersonic flight is restricted to over-ocean routes, you can’t fly a supersonic craft over any landmass due to the noise pollution.If you look at Concorde and Virgin Galactic’s Mach 3, you’ll see they are ridiculously similar. This is no coincidence. Rolls Royce powered Concorde, it is now powering Virgin Galactic.Their first design will essentially be Concorde Part Two. Hypersonic comes later. Actually injecting into orbit, gravity will be the main force at work regarding propulsion.

February 2021: I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic. Q1 2021: The Q3 Earnings Presentation outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane: This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&V elements. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2) Once Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson. The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. Surviving to 2025: This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year. There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date. Beyond 2025: Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market. Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little: Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN Let's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share What's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism. Let's look at Space Tourism, the predicted market cap is $3BN, which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. Beyond 2030: Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci: The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities. One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us: While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear. Let's Talk Technology: VMS Eve is the name of the WhiteKnightTwo mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. SpaceShipTwo is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. The cabin has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology. Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce unveiled the Mach 3 design which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. On a large private jet: $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. In my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry. Key Staff and Players: Founder - Sir Richard Branson: Founder of the Virgin Group (Virgin Mobile, Virgin Atlantic, etc.) CEO - Michael Colglazier: Former President and Managing Director of Disney Parks International CTO (Chief Space Officer) - George Whitesides: Former Chief of Staff NASA CFO - Jon Campagna: Former Corporate Controller of ICON Aircraft Inc. Noteworthy Investors: Vanguard Bank of America Morgan Stanley ARK Boeing Chamath Palihapitiya (Also a Virgin Galactic Chairman) Cathie Wood (presumably through ARKK) Partners: Boeing ( investor/hopes to be a part of the hypersonic point-to-point travel ) Rolls Royce ( designing and developing engine propulsion technology for high speed commercial aircraft as well as interior design ) NASA ( a plethora of tasks including transportation to the ISS, research, and hypersonic point-to-point travel ) Lockheed Martin ( developer of the Supersonic X-59 plane which will be used for testing hypersonic travel ) Under Armour (suits) Bear Case: What if it explodes? As I stated before the last test flight to me demonstrated that the fail safes in place will prevent this from happening and the chart reflects that notion. Aside from that, I hate to be that guy, but fatalities are expected with companies especially in emerging technologies. Remember when Tesla decapitated someone? Or the growing list of Airline incidents? Or how about when a Remington trigger malfunction killed hundreds? While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company. Virgin Galactic had a fatality in 2014 and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets. SpaceX: This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his hypersonic capabilities for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth. It is a hype driven stock: This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations. The price right now is pure hype and speculation on what Virgin Galactic COULD become. Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit. I think this will remain hyped for a very long time as I mentioned early, most investors aren't here for space tourism. Space tourism is the PayPal, hypersonic flight is the Tesla. Thank you all for reading, if you don't want to actually read this check out the video DD: Video DD TL;DR: Space tourism is the start, hypersonic point-to-point travel is the golden nugget. This isn't some new technology, it's a revolution in human travel. Watch carefully this week. The test flight was delayed and that news was announced ATH on Friday. It is possible that we see a sell-off happen at market open. I don't know how long the sell-off will go or how big of an impact this will have. In the past delays and issues made the price plummet, however, there are new long term investors who might not even flinch at this news. This week is a buying opportunity. If this DD was too long and the video DD was also too long check out the Too Long Didn't Watch (TL;DW) video here: TL;DW Video DD","You’re right they did. My mistake.I mean it was on its way out but for reasons not suffered by modern technologies. It was an insaneeee fuel burner in a time with insane fuel prices.You’re right, I meant to say “across” the globe, not “around” the globe. The Mach 3 is currently in design. However they have discussed publicly the notion of hypersonic flight claiming to be able to offer trips from LA to Hong Kong in less than 2 hours within the next decade.Supersonic is the start, hypersonic comes next. The important part is “point-to-point”. Their design, even if it’s from the 60’s (which I don’t know why that’s a bad thing, plenty of ideas are tried, forgotten, then tried again) allows them the competitive advantage in point-to-point travel. They are able to take off and land at any traditional airport.It’s all fine and good to question their current business, but this isn’t a industry I would personally like to see rushed. Elon blows up a rocket every other week, who knows what Blue Origin will do but they are moving too fast imo. Slow is exactly what I want to see in this very dangerous industry.Yeah, hypersonic flight is going to be difficult for any company, not just Virgin Galactic. What I find interesting is you are bashing Virgin Galactic for the design from the X-15 acting like that’s old news, but the X-15 still holds the record for the fastest, crewed powered aircraft. A record that hasn’t been broken by anyone. So you keep referring to the 60’s like that’s a bad thing but it’s still something we as humans haven’t surpassed or even really started attempting again until recently. There were a few attempts, but nothing anywhere near the level of the X-15. This is a very difficult problem to solve...for everyone.Supersonic will make a return first, hypersonic will come next.I really should have put this in the DD but space tourism might be Virgin Galactic’s “core” business, but it’s not their most interesting component. Neither is point-to-point travel (although it is to me). The most overlooked part of Virgin Galactic is they are the sole owner of The Spaceship Company. TSC is collaborating with Boom.Boeing is working with Virgin, but they are building their own. Virgin is building their own; but working with Boom. Same with Lockheed and Boom. All of these guys are working together. While there is still competition for the market, the market won’t exist and is likely 5-10 years away. So collaboration to bring the market faster is in everyone’s best interest.And of course! I already did put money into it and wrote this DD so I feel that’s a give, but best of luck with whatever horse you bet on in this race.",3,0.525,NEGATIVE,0.996
