Semiconductor industry will continue to be rocky and yet continue to grow in my opinion - I actually work in trade compliance with these sanctions daily. This is administration agnostic in my opinion too, it wasn’t just a political thing and will continue in the next several years as there are many agencies involved (ie CFIUS and concerns of Chinese investment in US companies for proprietary tech).Even aside automotive, we’re going to see tremendous growth in 5G communications, UAVs, AI, and EVs (including ancillary like battery tech, LIDAR, etc.).I also like SMH (ETF) of which TSM is the main holding along with many other chip players, plus ASML who make the chip making machines.

I work with tech quite a bit at work (e.g. reviewing export restrictions), but wouldn’t claim to be the strongest with fundamental analysis, especially with the nuances of how a deal (or lack thereof) would impact NVDA and the other players in mobile, tablet, and server market. I think it would give them a great edge in expanding their market and pairing NVDA GPUs with it. However, even if the deal fails, I see no reason to abandon NVDA either. Their GPU tech will ensure they remain leaders in data centers, and we’re only just getting started with EV. It takes a lot of processing power for sensor fusion (LIDAR, RADAR, IMU, camera, etc.), and I feel they’ll be a major player here because GPUs are much more efficient than CPUs for this type of processing (Google NVDA level 5 autonomous driving).",2,0.521,POSITIVE,0.966

Realizing the 5nm node at HVM over the last 18 months has seen them get a good chunk of their future priced in, it was a savvy buy when there was still some uncertainty around EUV introduction enabling that and future nodes, but now that uncertainty is gone and the price reflects it.Semi space is a great place to play but for shorter term moves related to covering the overall IC squeeze on non-high end chips are probably companies like $NXPI and $TXN (haven't looked super closely at this but I would expect those types of fabs are the ones to zero in on, do your own DD there), for broader long term plays in ETFs $SMH has a large exposure to $TSM (14%).Check in on $TSM later 2022 to see the outlook on their risk production w.r.t. 3nm ICs, probably better purchasing environment if you're bullish on them hitting that node. In the mean time you might be able to find a better place to put the money as the Semi conductor sector as a whole is always exposed to a lot of downside risk - Semi conductors are hyper-cyclical as an industry, undersupply phase like what people are talking about now is usually a strong buy signal, but the last Semi conductor industry contraction was in 2018 and it's been a huge bull run since, so history indicates another contraction by end of 2022. The signals are mixed there obviously (history indicates one thing supply news indicates another) but you're somewhat exposed to buying in near the peak of this cycle if you invest over the course of this year (maybe we're in for a long cycle and there's a lot of juice left, but I think most people's risk sensitivity should steer them a bit away toward other sectors).Transparency - 13% of my portfolio is $SMH.",0,0.529,NEGATIVE,0.997

Not so sure I'd expect anything big out of the rest of the world - maybe the EU gets behind subsidizing one of their logic houses to try to compete at the top end, but I see zero indication they have an apatite for that sort of thing (but of course it could happen if the EU decides it's to their advantage). It's a really high barrier to entry and the current fabs are well established, I'd expect if anything we see IC manufacturing continue to concentrate over the next decade as more and more of the mid-sized fabs in memory or low-range logic can't keep up with the investment needed to keep their fabs profitable. It's the same reason we've seen company after company drop out of the top-of-the-line logic space, profitable fabrication is really expensive, and the field moves fast enough a rough period can take your knees out.And funny you talk about monopolies not being tolerated when pretty much every branch of the supply chain leading into a fab is dominated by somebody, $AMAT with wafer processing, $ASML with exposure systems, $KLA with metro-equipment etc. If $TSM or somebody can elbow the rest of the market off a specific corner of the IC space the market at large 100% will let them do it.

Companies that can produce new generation microchip (7 and 5 nm) are INTEL, SAMSUNG and TSMC. Between the three Intel is the one who's struggling the most. Other than those three, Apple, Arm, Nvidia and Qualcomm play a big part in the game, but they actually design the chips and make TSMC to produce them. Trenforce, mentioned by Bloomberg, said that 56% of the gains from microchip worldwide income has been generated by TSMC. That's due to commercial war between US and China. To prevent sanctions and duties, companies cancelled orders to China making workload of other companies outside China raised (or raising? I'm not english). Sony, Microsoft are saying that market is slowing down a bit for them aswell. Meanwhile TSMC has announced in the past weeks that they've managed to increase their productive power. I use DEGIRO and I'm not allowed to buy TSMC. If I could, I would to it. TSMC it's cheap. But you might be interested and I just wanted to be part of this give and take game Hugs","3D printer which can print electronic chips. This is something which will disrupt traditional chip makers.This sort of statement makes it obvious you do not understand the technology. Digital Lithography (not additive, but an alternative IC fab process to photo lithography) has been around for ages and it has no industrial application because it can't compete with photolithography speeds. Mind productivity on these photolithography machines is like 5 die exposures per second. Not even considering the physical limitations of additive manufacturing in terms of feature size (which is huge and obvious) unless they can shit out 40,000 ICs an hour they don't make any industrial sense compared to present methods.additive IC fabrication is orders of magnitude off in both quality of what can be produced and the speed at which it produces - and it will never be able to compete with photolithography (on either axis, let alone both) for literal laws of physics reasons. How exactly you expect that to ""disrupt"" anything I have no idea. Like saying messenger pigeon is going to disrupt the internet.",1,0.514,NEGATIVE,1.0
