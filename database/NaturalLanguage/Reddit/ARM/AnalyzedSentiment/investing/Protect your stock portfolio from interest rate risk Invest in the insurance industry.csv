,"Treasury rates fell sharply this past month.  The 2 year rate was 4.7% 1 month ago and now it's 3.8% in the pre-market this evening.  This is a 19% decrease in 30 days. So, interest rate risk to stock portfolios is not a hot topic right now.  But it should be because treasury rate volatility has increased sharply along with VIX.  The MOVE bond volatility index went up 10% on Friday alone.  This volatility means there is a much greater chance of large increases (as well as decreases) in treasury rates. How is it possible to protect a portfolio from interest rate risk? It's difficult.  This is because upward spikes in rates generally decrease stock and bond prices.  In 2022, 10 year treasury rates more than doubled: from 1.7% at the start of the year to 4.1%.  Total return of the US stock market (VTI) was -20%.  Total return of the bond market (BND) was -13%.  Long term treasuries, which were often seen as a hedge for economic downturns, returned -31%!  Defensive sectors: (utilities health care, staples) & gold were flat to slightly negative. But one sub-sector performed exceptionally well in 2022: Property and Casualty  Insurance.  These companies are required to maintain huge cash reserves for future claims.  These reserves are invested in safe short term holdings like US treasuries.  When interest rates rise, their income generated from investments also rises.  As an example: White Mountains insurance (WTM) made $194 million investment income in 2023 vs. $82.5 million in 2021. The five largest P&C insurance companies had an average return of +20% in 2022, nearly 40% better than the US stock market. A large part of this performance was due to the increase in investment income. https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&sl=4OyBhd9rwOGsbv7nMgi4HX Everyone is thinking about rate cuts and disinflation, but what are some scenarios that could cause major interest rate increases? 1.  There are signs that the huge $20 trillion Japan carry trade is unwinding.  This evening, the Nikkei is down another 6.4%. The carry trade involves international investors borrowing from low yielding Japan to invest in the higher yielding USA.  The yen weakened in the past few years, resulting in additional gains for investors when they repaid the loan. But the yen has become too weak and oil and gasoline is too expensive for Japanese consumers and businesses.  The BOJ has intervened, strengthening the yen.  If the yen strengthens enough, carry trade investors will be margin called and forced to move their money from US stocks and treasuries back to Japanese yen.  Treasury prices will fall sharply and rates will spike upwards. 2.  China or Russia could attempt to swing the election.  China could attempt this by resuming/accelerating their sales of US treasuries causing rates to spike.  Conventional wisdom is that China doesn't want a Trump presidency and the risk of new trade tariffs.  But they would actually gladly accept tariffs if it means an isolationist foreign policy and an end to the arms flow to Taiwan. And Russia could attempt this by initiating a major offensive in Ukraine in the coming months.  Russia now has a manpower advantage and an overwhelming artillery and armor advantage.  Ukrainian air defense is so degraded that Russian planes are operating directly overhead the Ukrainian front line. A successful offensive would create a crisis of confidence on a much greater scale than what we saw during the Afghanistan withdrawal.  A blow to American and allied military hegemony would also be a blow to American economic hegemony.  Capital would flow out of American dollars and US treasuries and rates could spike. Of course, rates could also decrease due to risk of recession or disinflation.  But it's best to plan for all possible outcomes.

","So your thesis is to go IS companies because they invest in short term rates securities? It feels like then every year from here they will be forced to invest in continually lower interest bearing assets thus leading to continually lower returns.What impacts will lower rates have on premiums? Is it possible premiums increase as rates cut and the consumer can place themselves into more expensive assets like newer cars/homes/entertainment vehicles as the price to lend money becomes cheaper again?This increase in premiums I could see driving a further appreciating insurance company value but I struggle to identify where the increased value from investing in short term securities is going to come from?I mean hell, the talk of the street is yield curve un-inversion leading back to the normalcy again of short term lending yielding less than long term lending as it should be.",0,0.542,NEGATIVE,0.999
,"Treasury rates fell sharply this past month.  The 2 year rate was 4.7% 1 month ago and now it's 3.8% in the pre-market this evening.  This is a 19% decrease in 30 days. So, interest rate risk to stock portfolios is not a hot topic right now.  But it should be because treasury rate volatility has increased sharply along with VIX.  The MOVE bond volatility index went up 10% on Friday alone.  This volatility means there is a much greater chance of large increases (as well as decreases) in treasury rates. How is it possible to protect a portfolio from interest rate risk? It's difficult.  This is because upward spikes in rates generally decrease stock and bond prices.  In 2022, 10 year treasury rates more than doubled: from 1.7% at the start of the year to 4.1%.  Total return of the US stock market (VTI) was -20%.  Total return of the bond market (BND) was -13%.  Long term treasuries, which were often seen as a hedge for economic downturns, returned -31%!  Defensive sectors: (utilities health care, staples) & gold were flat to slightly negative. But one sub-sector performed exceptionally well in 2022: Property and Casualty  Insurance.  These companies are required to maintain huge cash reserves for future claims.  These reserves are invested in safe short term holdings like US treasuries.  When interest rates rise, their income generated from investments also rises.  As an example: White Mountains insurance (WTM) made $194 million investment income in 2023 vs. $82.5 million in 2021. The five largest P&C insurance companies had an average return of +20% in 2022, nearly 40% better than the US stock market. A large part of this performance was due to the increase in investment income. https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&sl=4OyBhd9rwOGsbv7nMgi4HX Everyone is thinking about rate cuts and disinflation, but what are some scenarios that could cause major interest rate increases? 1.  There are signs that the huge $20 trillion Japan carry trade is unwinding.  This evening, the Nikkei is down another 6.4%. The carry trade involves international investors borrowing from low yielding Japan to invest in the higher yielding USA.  The yen weakened in the past few years, resulting in additional gains for investors when they repaid the loan. But the yen has become too weak and oil and gasoline is too expensive for Japanese consumers and businesses.  The BOJ has intervened, strengthening the yen.  If the yen strengthens enough, carry trade investors will be margin called and forced to move their money from US stocks and treasuries back to Japanese yen.  Treasury prices will fall sharply and rates will spike upwards. 2.  China or Russia could attempt to swing the election.  China could attempt this by resuming/accelerating their sales of US treasuries causing rates to spike.  Conventional wisdom is that China doesn't want a Trump presidency and the risk of new trade tariffs.  But they would actually gladly accept tariffs if it means an isolationist foreign policy and an end to the arms flow to Taiwan. And Russia could attempt this by initiating a major offensive in Ukraine in the coming months.  Russia now has a manpower advantage and an overwhelming artillery and armor advantage.  Ukrainian air defense is so degraded that Russian planes are operating directly overhead the Ukrainian front line. A successful offensive would create a crisis of confidence on a much greater scale than what we saw during the Afghanistan withdrawal.  A blow to American and allied military hegemony would also be a blow to American economic hegemony.  Capital would flow out of American dollars and US treasuries and rates could spike. Of course, rates could also decrease due to risk of recession or disinflation.  But it's best to plan for all possible outcomes.

","I don't think it should be assumed that they will be forced to invest in continuously lower interest rate assets every year from here.
