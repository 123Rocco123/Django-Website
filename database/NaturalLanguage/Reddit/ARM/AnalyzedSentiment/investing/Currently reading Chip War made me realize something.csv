While Semiconductors and chips will always be important in our society what happens if:AI boom plateaus, and losers fall off and stop buying and only a few winners remain?AMD make a competitor that is worthy of NVDA's market shares such that an 80% profit margin is no longer validI'm sure all of these factors are somewhat prices in, but still. Also, I was saying this same thing when NVDA was like 800, so I also recognize how that didn't age well... but the idea still seems to stand.",1,0.548,NEGATIVE,0.908

INTC is the perfect response to this. Intel was once the king of chipmakers. They printed money. Now, the stock is down 30% over 5 years.IBM which made tons of hardware, among many businesses, is up about 30% over the past 5 years, but still lags the market and their business has diversified away from chips for the most part.Hardware might be a good sector play, technology is not going anywhere anytime soon as OP points out, but trying to pick a single stock to win isn't a guarantee. And if you have to make a bet, do you bet that Nvidia will continue a ~50% earnings growth YoY for a decade? Or that a competitor unlocks one product that lets them grow at above market rate?Frankly, the same question - will any one of these companies grow faster than the S&P500 at an acceptable risk premium of putting all your eggs in one basket?",2,0.548,NEGATIVE,1.0

You should look at the factors and figure out why something is priced or not.

If that something is important, it's a pretty safe investment until competition catches up or the importance of the thing diminishes.They’re not Tesla and riding on hype alone.I don't think you should compare to things like that alone. NVDA is DEFINITELY propped up by the current AI craze and a lot of that shit is overhyped.

ARM is a safe bet because they own their architecture so they can license it, but NVIDIA would be a huge risk.Essentially Amazon runs AWS on 3 different chip types. Intel, AMD, and then their own custom processors. As more companies make that switch, there is less profit in mass produced semiconductors. FPGA chips have the most compute power for their task and it's going to be much easier to make those switches.

Training takes a ton of cards, but in the long run, inference/usage is the bulk.Bitnets are neural nets where the weights are binary or ternary (-1, 0, 1). This makes it so that each weight uses much less memory, mem bandwidth, but more importantly makes it so that matrix multiplications become integer additions rather than floating point multiplications. Integer math units are incredibly small compared to fp multiply units, you can cram far more, and they use much less power per operation. You can do a huge amount on a relatively simple, low power chip. Not a great thing for driving demand of bleeding edge chips.On the other hand, this would make it so that these things could be integrated into low power electronics everywhere, rather than being limited to being run on the cloud, and I'm guessing demand for models would rise with it. Alternatively, we could make them much larger to try to bump up the quality. Maybe both would happen.I think this stuff is going to be integrated everywhere, and be an absolutely titanic market.
