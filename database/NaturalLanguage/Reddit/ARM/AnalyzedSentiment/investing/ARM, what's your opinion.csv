,I was considering to open a buy position for ARM. This because I considered Intel's recent problems and the tentative of some producers to build arm based computer devices. It also appears to be 20 - 30% undervalued. Before going in deep with my analysis I would like to know the opinion of people with more experience.,Love it! I have two!,0,0.552,POSITIVE,0.999

It also appears to be 20 - 30% undervalued. Before going in deep with my analysis I would like to know the opinion of people with more experience.,"ARM (I presume you mean ARM:NSQ here) is massively overvalued in my book. Its cap:income ratio is around 272, cap:equity ratio is around 36 (I'm using its 2023 fiscal data). This is extreeeeeeemly high. I consider a stock undervalued when its cap:income ratio is below 10, and cap:equity ratio is below 3. I should add, even for tech, which tends to be overvalued in general, these are extremely high ratios.",0,0.537,NEGATIVE,1.0

Before going in deep with my analysis I would like to know the opinion of people with more experience.,"One thing Intel has a bit of an advantage (competitive?) over ARM in the PC market is the x86 architecture for which the vast majority of desktop software is written on.I believe this was a bit of an issue for Microsoft's recent ""Copilot+ PCs"" which ran on ARM. Problem being, issues with running software such as videogames that were written on x86 architecture.Big challenge for ARM will be to have emulation capabilities to run x86 on ARM without affecting performance (such as on videogames) for their desktop hardware... In order to get a leg up there.Note: I'm not an expert in this space, this is just from articles I've read. I think it was the WSJ.",0,0.531,NEGATIVE,1.0

While it’s true most software is targeting x86, in most programming languages this is just a compiler setting, and it wouldn’t take much if any actual code changes to target ARM. It may take some extra work to optimize software for ARM, but getting it to run isn’t a huge effort.",1,0.52,NEGATIVE,1.0

As you mentioned there is emulation or compatibility layers, but these come with performance costs.But I’d say with most old software, the performance gains from new generations of CPUs probably outweigh the loss from emulation, so it can at least run as it did when it was released.",3,0.528,NEGATIVE,0.931

Before going in deep with my analysis I would like to know the opinion of people with more experience.,"Yeah this is rapidly changing. x86 is a compile target for a lot of software, and compilers can often support multiple targets in addition.Even outside of emulators there are projects like wine that provide a compatibility layer (I run Diablo 4, a modern Windows game, directly on my M3 Mac Pro with no emulator or VM with wine). Not saying this will be mainstream, but it’s showing the x86 moat may not be as wide as one might think.Intel has some work to do.",1,0.515,NEGATIVE,0.994
