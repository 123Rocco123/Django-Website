,"Key Stats for Boeing Co Well the popular vote is for a post on Boeing! So let's take a trip to the top of the Dow 30. Ticker BA Sector Commercial Aircraft Manufacturing Latest price $131.16 Value $81,821M Daily vol $353M Date 06 September 2016 Useful Links Latest news from Google Finance and Yahoo Finance Latest results from SEC Edgar Website: http://www.boeing.com/ Description The Boeing Company is an aerospace firm with a commercial jet arm and a defense industry division. Sure there are other services on the side, but these are what count! In fact over 70% of sales are from the commercial arm ($66bn v $30bn from defense) and over 60% of earnings from it ($5bn v $3bn from defence).

We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share, such as Airbus, Embraer and Bombardier, and other entrants from Russia, China and Japan. and in Defense, where there are lots of rules to ensure that ""enemies"" can't sell kit to the US govt, but that does stop the Europeans selling to the US, and they do a pretty good job of it. we faces strong competition in all market segments, primarily from Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raytheon Company and General Dynamics Corporation. Non-U.S. companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group, continue to build a strategic presence in the U.S. market by strengthening their North American operations and partnering with U.S. defense companies. So with all the trappings of being the gorilla, what does it add up to... great returns but rubbish margins. Even the ragbag of a business Airbus manages a higher margin. So what's going on? Are they winning business v the other A&D players by bidding too low? Is the heavily unionized workforce getting a larger share of the cashflow than at the competition?

Our overall view of the business environment remains generally positive due to healthy industry fundamentals. Global passenger traffic continues to solidly outpace GDP, with IATA reporting 6% growth year to date. On the cargo side, the market remains sluggish with year to date freight traffic down approximately 1%. So there is a nice secular growth story here for Commercial. And at the Defense arm Domestically, the President's budget request for fiscal year 2017 advances key programs and we are anticipating a period of modest growth in defense spending over the next five years. Were the charges that hit earnings in 2Q and caused the downgrades one off? From $7.44 a share in 2015 to $6.31 this year. With Wall Street expecting a bumper $9.64 in 2017. Well, if they can hit the Sept forecast of $2.63 a share in earnings and persuade us there are no more nasties coming in terms of charges, then yes. Perhaps the Wall Street optimism is justified.

This will hopefully lead to an opportunity to update the aging fleet that a lot of the majors have.Boeing has been passed up on the last several major defense contracting deals in favor of Northrop G, Lockheed etc. While this doesn't seem like good news initially, the US gov like to breed domestic competition and has been known to spread their contracts around to all of the major defense companies. BA is overdue for one of these.I have benefited greatly from ZERO of the above circumstances. Most of the gains that I've seen came from things that were completely unpredictable (Iran ordered a bunch of new planes, etc.). I'm sure there is a lesson somewhere in all of this but for now I'm just happy that I guessed correctly, even if my thesis wasn't right.",0,0.533,POSITIVE,0.999

Non-U.S. companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group, continue to build a strategic presence in the U.S. market by strengthening their North American operations and partnering with U.S. defense companies.
