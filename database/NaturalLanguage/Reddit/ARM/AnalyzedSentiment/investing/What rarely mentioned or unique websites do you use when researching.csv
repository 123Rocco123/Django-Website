,"We all know about Google Finance, Morningstar, Zacks, and a bunch of others, but I'm looking for unique websites that have an easy to use UI with all the info I need within arms reach. I stumbled onto a website a few months ago (from this sub, I think) that would allow you to put in a ticker and it would give you not only the chart and price, but also various multiples compared to industry/sector, graphs of select data points for several years (sales, revenues, etc) and a bunch of other things. It also had links to SEC filings so that you could easily access relevant documents once you gave the basics a once-over. I want to say it was free, or at least some of it was free with some sections unlocked for the paid version. Anyway, I'm just looking for the best websites for research that aggregate and organize info in an easy to read format. Morningstar does this to an extent, but sometimes I don't want to look at a 12x30 table with number, I just want an overview to weed out the crappiest of crap stocks I don't need to spend any more time on. Here are two of mine: ValueLine - Sort of what I'm talking about above but a lot of it is behind a subscription that I can't afford as a student who's just started to learn. St Louis Fed - AMAZING tool for macro research if you're interested in that","Check www.stockrow.com. Great way to see a snapshot about a company over the past handful of years.I think the website is relatively new. On the financials, it has some trouble pulling all the sub-financial captions for some foreign issuers.

I stumbled onto a website a few months ago (from this sub, I think) that would allow you to put in a ticker and it would give you not only the chart and price, but also various multiples compared to industry/sector, graphs of select data points for several years (sales, revenues, etc) and a bunch of other things. It also had links to SEC filings so that you could easily access relevant documents once you gave the basics a once-over. I want to say it was free, or at least some of it was free with some sections unlocked for the paid version. Anyway, I'm just looking for the best websites for research that aggregate and organize info in an easy to read format. Morningstar does this to an extent, but sometimes I don't want to look at a 12x30 table with number, I just want an overview to weed out the crappiest of crap stocks I don't need to spend any more time on. Here are two of mine: ValueLine - Sort of what I'm talking about above but a lot of it is behind a subscription that I can't afford as a student who's just started to learn.
