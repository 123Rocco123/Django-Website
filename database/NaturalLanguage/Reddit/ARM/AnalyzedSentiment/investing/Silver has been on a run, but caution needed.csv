,"I've held investments in silver for years. I've seen excitement, depression and more false dawns than you can shake a stick at. I look at this current run and yes, I'm happy. But I'm not getting carried away. Silver is a master of doing a rug pull just as you're getting comfortable. There are a few reasons to be bullish: Gold It's going strong and tends to drag silver with it Debt monetization/inflation Tons of debt and risk that rates might be cut prematurely before inflation is well and truly vanquished. If USD weakens as a result, this will lead to further upward pressure on silver (and most raw materials) Global conflict Silver is the primary raw material in arms. Lots of military action going on around the world, as we know Upward trend In the last two months silver has risen 26%. It's got the wind behind its back and when things go up, they tend to continue going up. Unless it's silver, which brings me to - Reasons to be bearish : Head fake history We've been here before and silver has slid back down. Silver's all time high was back in April 2011 ($49). We've never been close since. Supply There's still plenty of supply around the world Dependency on global growth Silver is an industrial metal. Slowdown in economic growth and recession can bring demand for silver down How to play silver? Physical metal My preferred choice. A good diversifier in a portfolio. You can buy coins or by the oz with specialist brokers on line who can store it for you. Silver ETFs Convenient and easily tradeable, but look for ones that are backed by physical silver. Silver Miners if investing in silver is like riding a roller coaster, investing in silver miners is like riding the roller-coaster without a seat belt. Highly volatile (much more than the metal). Unlike my physical silver holdings, my silver miner investments have been very disappointing. Do your due diligence big time and position size appropriately. Disclosure: I own physical silver and some silver miners Edit: The above is just some points of consideration and not an endorsement to invest in silver or anything silver related. I do see precious metals as useful diversifier in a portfolio (less than 5%) Personally speaking, I think this rally is overdone and it doesn't have the margin of safety that I would be looking for. Apologies for not making this clearer earlier. My thanks to u/aytikvjo",The turn in in silver can be picked out on 2 exact days March 1 & 4. It doesn't matter if a person could identify it at the time it's obvious in hindsight now.Why did it turn at that exact time? If your answer is because gold broke out then why did gold break out at that exact time?,0,0.515,NEGATIVE,1.0

Who knows and who gives a shit about the why. Jump on board then bail out when it stops going up. It's still going up as of today.
