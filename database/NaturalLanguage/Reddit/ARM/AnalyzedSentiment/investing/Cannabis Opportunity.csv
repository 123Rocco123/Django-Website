,"Getting screwed for being a good person and trusting people will follow through. ðŸ“· A few years ago I moved to Southern Humboldt County and my wife and I saw a special opportunity to take advantage of an emerging and growing cannabis market. In 2017 we purchased our first farm and to say the least it was fun, exciting and a ton of work. With in a year of operating we quickly realized what our place would be in the market place if we let the business grow organically. With a quick assessment of my wife and I's financial position at the time, we knew we wouldn't be able to build this dream in the vision we had or in the time we knew we had to make it to market and hold a position with out being swallowed by regulations, taxes and ""Big Money"". Where my wife and I shine is in operations, we are high level managers and operators. My entry level position coming into the industry was a bookkeeper for a startup in the compliant cannabis market. What that startup specialized in was mergers, acquisitions, hostel take overs, contracted operations management, and receivership operations management. The startup had multiple arms that also owned and operated licenses that were vertically integrated ( I didn't start in the California regulatory space, I have experience in multiple states laws and regulations). So, with this company I got a ridiculous amount of experience in the muddy world of partnership problems, mediation and litigation prep and building vertically integrated licenses from the ground up. My wife has been an operations manager fresh out of collage so we have a life time of experience in operations. Late 2017, My wife and I put together a plan to raise capital for our current farm at that time. We put together an info sheet with projections on what it would take to develop the farm and a timeline on how long it would take to get the development done. We then put together a cultivation plan and what could possibly be produced on the property when fully built out and what it would look like with a years operations. Through word of mouth and a tight social group we were able to raise 1.5 million to develop our cannabis farm. After completing this transaction with a lawyer that was introduced to us by who we thought was a friend. Let's call the lawyer ""Dick"". Dick, to say the least is a lawyer, now Dick helped us with the corporate structure and paperwork and bringing in some capital. We had so much interest in the first farm that we were able to grow from one farm to five farms. In the time of setting this small to large company up, most of the lenders involved happen to be close acquaintances to Dick. Mind you my wife and I trusted Dick and Dick has always been a lawyer giving us advise as a lawyer. I understand in the game of business trust no one but you and the interest of your company and don't believe anyone has your best interest in mind. I am now taking that advise to heart and living by it. Ok, long story short since I will be answering questions through private messaging. We are a year and a half into operations and development. Since we had done such a good job of growing and expanding the company in such a short time. my wife and I started looking to roll all of our current assets into a larger roll up that is vertically intergraded and build out everything to its maximum capacity and be a stand out in the California regulatory market. Somehow in the midst of things Dick has created a narrative that the lenders he has brought into the company will get paid back with in a year when all of the lenders signed 5 year notes, Some of these lenders have never even spoken to me or my wife or both, all communications has been through Dick. Now with the false narrative that we have circling through the lenders, some have conspired in the back ground to take assets and or want to take us to litigation for all of the wrong things Dick has done behind the scenes and are now blaming my wife and I for. We have pretty solid Operating agreements I have to say, they give us all the power and honestly I don't think some of the gentlemen like that a late 30's something is in control and they think they are better at life than my wife and I. Now, the dilemma we are in, all of the companies cash flow is tied up in operations as it should be and any revenue goes back into the business to ensure we're operating normally and getting prepped to go into a new season and property cleaning up and developing the farm's designated cultivation area outside of the forbearance period (It rains an upward of 7 feet of rain in my county and you are not allowed to do any earth work during this time). I have lender/members wanting to take farms and assets through collusion with other members conspiring in the background to levy lies through litigation to scare us into signing everything away.
