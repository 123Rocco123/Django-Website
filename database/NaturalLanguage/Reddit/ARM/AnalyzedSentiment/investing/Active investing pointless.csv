,"Disclaimer: I am new to investing and trying to wrap my head around ways to get a better return from the market. I've just read this link, and it seems that no investor can beat the market, and if you do it's because of luck only: http://www.npr.org/2016/03/10/469897691/armed-with-an-index-fund-warren-buffett-is-on-track-to-win-hedge-fund-bet I read elsewhere that because the other side of Buffett's bet was a fund of multiple hedge funds, it was so diversified that it was inevitable it would track a worse performance compared to the index fund due to fees. I can see the sense in that. However this link in particular is alarming because they are not claiming that is the reason for the poor performance, what they are claiming is that it's actually impossible to ever beat the market, it's just luck if you do. For example: KESTENBAUM: Isn't it also possible that it is just very, very hard to beat the market? SEIDES: Oh, it's not possible. That's a truth. And: people who beat the market in the past are not especially likely to beat it in the future. Warren Buffett, who is one of the most famous investors of all time, seems to share this view. Does this mean that even value investing is dead? That even if you correctly find inefficiencies in the market (such as over priced or under priced stock) your endeavors are just pointless, as the index fund will still win out? (Even assuming you're actively investing your own money so no giant fees are taken) Does this also mean that people that invested into Apple didn't win over the market due to their smarts, but just luck? I draw that conclusion because I always thought that a smart active investor could invest into stocks they reckon will do well. But from the link it seems that no investor can win due to smarts as the index fund always wins. What this means is that every investor in the world that beats an index fund is just doing so because of luck, not skill. Am I on the right path with this or am I missing something?","I agree that indexing is correct for almost every person. That said, there are a few issues with how you are thinking / how you phrased things.it was so diversified that it was inevitable it would track a worse performance compared to the index fund due to fees. I can see the sense in that.I cannot see the sense in that? If the snp is a diverse collection of 500 companies, why would a collection of collection of things automatically track a worse index?That said, comparing against the index (or snp) in the average case is...... normally very stupid or incorrect. Why? Odds are you will not be completely in stocks, as such using a stock only benchmark, is not useful for the average person.",0,0.543,NEGATIVE,1.0

Renaissance Medallion fund for example has obliterated the market for decades, outperforming almost every year. But... they are the best of the best, and they have to limit the size of the fund to effectively capitalize on the opportunities it finds. Outperformance among managers is inconsistent at the low to mid tiers, but firms that limit their size and have shown consistent results do tend to keep outperforming.Another way to beat the index is by taking more risk (leverage). Or by using a better 'market'. A fully diversified portfolio will outperform an equity-only portfolio on a risk adjusted basis, and by adding leverage it'll outperform on an absolute basis with equal risk.A third way is with systematic factors. Research has shown that there are ways to outperform the market over a long period that have not been arbitraged away yet. These alternative factors are getting scooped up by big quant firms, sometimes in market neutral funds which further drives down the opportunities for long-only investors.Similarly, market making activities that supply the market-like investors with liquidity can be used to supplement an index strategy to outperform.Areas of the market with low liquidity or that aren't well understood can be used to outperform by those in the know (or to underperform by those who only think they are).You mentioned luck. It can be very difficult to differentiate luck from skill with small sample sizes, and volatility from luck can easily overwhelm other sources of return. It can also be skewed. Imagine a trader who uses an instrument that acts like put writing and beats the index 65% of the time with less volatility. They (maybe even a whole banking industry...) might think they're outperforming, when in reality there is unaccounted-for risk that they will eventually hit.Is old fashioned value investing dead? No. Research and infrastructure can still lead to outperformance, but the rewards have been spread thin among so many experts managing billions of dollars each that it's not really worth the time for retail investors to do it except as a hobby.Selection bias will probably lead to a few commenters posting here who do it successfully. And confirmation bias may lead to a few more who think they do but actually don't (I can feel myself editing some of these points to try to not disqualify the edges I think I have).Which, by the way, leads into the other significant benefits of indexing besides low costs. Passivity saves investors from their own biases. Investors who trade are much more likely to leave funds/stocks/assets when they underperform and chase when they do well. Morningstar even created an 'investor returns' metric to capture this effect.",0,0.527,POSITIVE,0.925

The point buffet was trying to explain is that active investing like in hedge funds rely on humans and thusly end up with human error.Algorithm or high freq trading take the human error out of it to a degree. Afterall, a human still created the math in the backend, but you can test the algo for reliability.Value investing is similar to algo. Fundamentally you are trying to make an objective decision to avoid human error. Can you still be subject to human error?
