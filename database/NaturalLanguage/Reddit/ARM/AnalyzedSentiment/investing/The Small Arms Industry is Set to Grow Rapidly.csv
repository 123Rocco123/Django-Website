When was the last time S&W or Ruger or etc came out with anything that is truly revolutionary for the civilian market?Not to mention the constant deadlock on gun control, I assume as a US person, all other countries are becoming more and more strict on gun control, making guns harder to obtain and more socially unacceptable.War and governments drives weapons manufacturing growth, not the civilian market.Just because the pandemic and political situation helped the gun industry (jury's still out on that) doesn't mean it's a safe long term investment.Edit: this is an interesting idea, you should post this in r/guns, I'll be curious to see what gun owners and people in the industry think.",0,0.525,NEGATIVE,0.999

On the contrary, massive, growing markets in South America, SE Asia, some places in Africa, and the Middle East are rising steadily, especially Brazil and the Middle East.War and governments drives weapons manufacturing growthA vast majority (85%) of firearms are owned by civilians worldwideThat said, a large portion of that is resale, which is why gunmakers don't make $10bln+ annually.So the new sales segment is probably split either evenly or a few percentage points either way.As for military demand, I believe that will increase as well as poorer militaries become better equipped, PMCs rise in popularity, geopolitical tensions continue to escalate, etc.Just because the pandemic and political situation helped the gun industry (jury's still out on that) doesn't mean it's a safe long term investment.Yeah, hence I didn't quote the pandemic as a factor in my initial post.this is an interesting idea, you should post this in r/guns, I'll be curious to see what gun owners and people in the industry think.Sounds fun, will do.",1,0.532,NEGATIVE,0.998

But they sat on their laurels and stopped innovating, coupled with rising costs and competition, it is a shadow of its former self, having undergone several bankruptcies and changes in management, not a good sign for an investment. If you take out innovation, it's just operating at the mercy of the government and market.As for the countries you mentioned, well, those are where the demand would be, where the people have the most disposable income to use on a luxury, in SE Asia, middle east, and Africa, surplus firearms are cheap and plentiful, people are less likely to spend discretionary income on new guns. Not to mention super strict gun laws, so consumer access will be very limited. have you also accounted for gun import laws in these markets?Not to mention ITAR regulations, since we are talking about US companies. It is unlikely that current third world countries will do business with US companies. US may export more weapons than anyone else, but these are high dollar amount items, like jets, missiles, and etc (aerospace and defense contractors are a better bet) If we're talking small arms, China and Russia takes the cake.As for that statistics you provided, could there be another explanation? Perhaps because there are simply more civilians than there are soldiers? Have you compared non gun owning civilians vs gun owning civilians? The fact that the majority of guns are in civilian hands doesn't mean much by itself. If you mention resales, yes, then that money is not going to the manufacturer.Yours is not the first gun stock post, but there is a lot of posts like this since the pandemic started. I think you saw ammo, guns, and reloading material fly off the shelves and thought gun stocks must be doing great. but they were affected just like any other manufacturing.Edit: your assumptions and analysis doesn't consider all the aspects of the gun stocks listed.",2,0.531,NEGATIVE,1.0

I broke this down in a post on /r/dataisbeautiful a couple of days ago.Guns are on a long-term growth trend, but to a large degree, guns sales the past several months have been driven by a) yearly seasonal effects (hunting season + people blowing their tax returns), b) a Presidential election year, which always sees higher gun sales and c) the pandemic and ensuing recession caused a buying spree.Right now all three of those effects are going away, so I expect gun sales to decelerate rapidly over the next few months. I've finally found some guns I've been looking for in stock again after months of them being sold out, which suggests my thesis is correct.If you buy a firearm manufacturer stock that is ""priced for perfection"" assuming the Apocalypse is next week (which is what effectively has been the past year), and suddenly things slow down, you're going to get burned.",0,0.561,NEGATIVE,1.0

The rise of hyperpolarization and populism Uncertain or polarized political circumstances means more people hostile toward one another. This was at the fore during riots last year and the Capitol Insurrection. Partially as a result, gun sales were at record highs last year. I see this polarization, due to the spread of social media, rising across the globe and thus, long term gun sales. Long Term Industry Consolidation is Likely As with many other industries, consolidation is very likely in the firearms industry as they inevitably face scaling and uncertain political climates. Investors will benefit most from this consolidation provided you choose a company not going bankrupt. There's just a lot of room to grow Gunmaker's supply chain is ridiculously overcomplex with lots of simplification that could happen (Glock rates higher in this but they're private :( ). The merchandising chain also leaves lots of profit on the table (suppliers, coordinators, retailers, etc.). Models could also be optimized, tech better integrated, etc. There's just a lot of cash to grow into. All in all, the gun industry presents an interesting opportunity for growth, beyond their current trading dynamic, something I will be tracking in earnest. Just wish Sig and Glock were public lol. My Picks: Smith & Wesson: Will benefit most off of sales in the US, has enough cash on hand for consolidation opportunities, has ability to streamline, cult base, etc. Taurus: If Glock or S&W are the Apple of firearms, Taurus is the Samsung, the mass market firearm corporation that I believe will be immensely popular in developing countries, considering its success in Brazil and Colombia",dont forget geo and cxw then.,3,0.499,POSITIVE,0.934
,"I may do a much longer and well-sourced post on this when I have more time, but here's a rundown of why the small arms industry, in my opinion, is an excellent long term investment, not even looking at how the Biden administration will play into the cyclical nature of gun stocks. The Youth in Existing Gun Markets Support Liberalization Something like 60% of youth support gun rights; this is a big indicator that government policy will not do anything to harm the industry to a large extent.
