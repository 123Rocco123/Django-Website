These guys have brazenly IPOed unprofitably because the plan is to monetize further down the road.The plan is simple... increase prices. How much?The financial revenue and loss (3B and 1B for Lyft) is talked about, but I think it’s more important to look at loss vs bookings. Bookings were $17B. That ratio is more informative than revenue, in terms of how much price increase is needed to turn a profit.When you look at bookings vs loss, they only need to raise prices 5% to reach profitability. Compared to taxi and other alternatives, I think ride sharing is still great value at 10-20% extra cost to me.In that way, I think there is a clear path to profitability now that both companies are public and need to turn a profit. We will see higher prices as consumers shortly. People will still take ride share because there are no other good options.",1,0.535,NEGATIVE,0.999
