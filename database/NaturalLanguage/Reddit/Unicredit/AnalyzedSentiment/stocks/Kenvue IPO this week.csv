I looked into buying, and I just don't see buying it. Am I missing something?Yes, these are well known brands and it's pretty straightfoward to project revenue and earnings because the sales are already there. There is also a ton of competition in these products and I feel JnJ is spinning off the lowest-margin leg of their business.With 10% earnings on revenue, I get a current P/E ratio of about 34-35. Other consumer brands like P&G sit at about 27. That means a similar target for JVUE would be about $21/share.
