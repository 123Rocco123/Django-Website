None of the banks were Canadian banks, but it does need to be noted that Canadian banks received some $114 billion from Canada’s federal government. This was against the background of Canadian banks being declared “the most sound banking system in the world.” At the time, the government denied there was any bailout, preferring to use the term “liquidity support.” To put the $114 billion support into perspective, the bailout would have made up 7% of the Canadian economy (GDP) in 2009 and was worth CAD$3,400 for every man, woman and child in Canada. By contrast, the Bush-Obama Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) was worth approximately CAD$3,000 for every man, woman and child in the United States.According to an April 2012 report from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA), such was the extent of the government’s rescue operation that three of Canada’s banks—CIBC, BMO and Scotiabank—were at some point completely underwater, with the government support they were drawing exceeding their respective values. In March 2009, CIBC stood out for receiving support worth almost one and a half times the value of all outstanding shares. It would have taken less money to have simply bought all the shares in CIBC instead of providing it with support.The study also points out that during the two-year period of the bailout Canada’s banks remained highly lucrative. They reported a total of $27 billion in profits and quickly rewarded shareholders with fat dividends and their leading executives with handsome raises to their pay packages. All of the major banks’ CEOs ranked, and continue to rank, among the highest paid of the country’s top one hundred executives. TD Bank’s Edmund Clark, for example, accepted a pay increase from $11.1 million in 2008 to $15.2 million the following year.https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=2008+liquidity+support+canada&atb=v1-1&ia=webhttps://www.policyalternatives.ca/publications/reports/big-banks-big-secrethttps://www.bankofcanada.ca/2010/02/liquidity-facilities-past-present-future/https://financialpost.com/news/fp-street/did-canadian-banks-receive-a-secret-bailouthttps://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2012/05/cana-m14.html",1,0.527,NEGATIVE,0.507

None of the banks were Canadian banks, but it does need to be noted that Canadian banks received some $114 billion from Canada’s federal government. This was against the background of Canadian banks being declared “the most sound banking system in the world.” At the time, the government denied there was any bailout, preferring to use the term “liquidity support.” To put the $114 billion support into perspective, the bailout would have made up 7% of the Canadian economy (GDP) in 2009 and was worth CAD$3,400 for every man, woman and child in Canada. By contrast, the Bush-Obama Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) was worth approximately CAD$3,000 for every man, woman and child in the United States.According to an April 2012 report from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA), such was the extent of the government’s rescue operation that three of Canada’s banks—CIBC, BMO and Scotiabank—were at some point completely underwater, with the government support they were drawing exceeding their respective values. In March 2009, CIBC stood out for receiving support worth almost one and a half times the value of all outstanding shares. It would have taken less money to have simply bought all the shares in CIBC instead of providing it with support.The study also points out that during the two-year period of the bailout Canada’s banks remained highly lucrative. They reported a total of $27 billion in profits and quickly rewarded shareholders with fat dividends and their leading executives with handsome raises to their pay packages. All of the major banks’ CEOs ranked, and continue to rank, among the highest paid of the country’s top one hundred executives. TD Bank’s Edmund Clark, for example, accepted a pay increase from $11.1 million in 2008 to $15.2 million the following year.https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=2008+liquidity+support+canada&atb=v1-1&ia=webhttps://www.policyalternatives.ca/publications/reports/big-banks-big-secrethttps://www.bankofcanada.ca/2010/02/liquidity-facilities-past-present-future/https://financialpost.com/news/fp-street/did-canadian-banks-receive-a-secret-bailouthttps://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2012/05/cana-m14.html",0,0.527,NEGATIVE,0.507
