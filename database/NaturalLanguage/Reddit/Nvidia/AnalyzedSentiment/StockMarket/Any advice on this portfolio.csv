,"For context: Roughly 25k in brokerage account Goal is to save for the long term (probably 10+ years) Age is 22 Strategy is the following: Invest most in the S&P500 (~60%), some in an IT ETF - higher risk for higher returns, and the rest in a variety of mostly large cap stocks I believe in. I just started investing earlier this year. Is this a good strategy? Going forward should I invest a larger % in VOO, or at my age can I afford to continue investing in my basket of stocks? Any advice or thoughts on particular stocks/ETFs are appreciated!",Isn't it a bit redundant to invest in those etfs and also so many individual stocks?How has the return % on your picks stacked up against the etfs?,0,0.535,NEGATIVE,0.914

Any advice or thoughts on particular stocks/ETFs are appreciated!","Nearly all stocks have performed better than the S&P500 over the past five years, some are newer like Zeta or Ge Vernova so it's tough to tell. The reason I choose individual stocks is to simulate creating my own ETF and do something a little different. If I had high weights on the most popular stocks (Apple, Nvidia, Amazon) then I agree it would be redundant.",1,0.524,NEGATIVE,0.945

But buying fractional Shares of individual stocks is limiting any upside potential they have. Focus on ETFs and a few tickers you know / believe in.,0,0.517,NEGATIVE,1.0
