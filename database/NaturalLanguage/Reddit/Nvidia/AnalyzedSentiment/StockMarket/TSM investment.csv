,"Does anyone have any opinions on if this is a good investment? Given the recent AI boom everyone is focused on big players such as NVIDIA and AMD, but they are both supplied heavily by TSM for their chips. I don’t see much competition for TSM given they are so far advanced ahead of any American or Chinese competitor, and given the only increase in demand for AI technology, I don’t see how they wouldn’t grow. Yes the stock is expensive right now, but given the growth opportunity I would argue there is still plenty of room for expansion. Yes, China is a threat, but something tells me that China would not dare suffer the economic sanctions western nations would impose if they made a move in Taiwan. Trump has said he would likely put tariffs on the Taiwan semiconductor industry in order to grow domestic production, but still with tariffs, I don’t see big players switching to alternatives, as the gap between TSM and alternatives is very large. Any thoughts on TSM as an investment?",TSM rocks. Been holding about a year,0,0.66,POSITIVE,1.0

Any thoughts on TSM as an investment?","I've been invested in SMH for quite some time now, and haven't regretted it. There's a heavy capping on international stocks like TSM in SOXX, which is why I opted for SMH, which has a relatively high % of TSM.And of course, an international-tilting (semiconductor) ETF is a good hedge in case of instability with China/Taiwan.",0,0.522,NEGATIVE,0.806

Any thoughts on TSM as an investment?",Are there any other options for the smallest semiconductors? My understanding is TSM won that race and no one else finished in terms of building facilities. We just started buying semiconductors from them and rearranging them to make the chips smaller,0,0.521,NEGATIVE,0.999

Any thoughts on TSM as an investment?","I kick myself everyday for selling off my tsm back in 2022ish after hearing Buffet sold due to geopolitical concerns. I’ve bought back in recently and am planning to hold for a while.Geopolitical concerns are overblown, in my personal opinion. And even if China ends up taking over, it would be stupid of them to destroy the chip making business. There may be policy changes and whatnot, but overall TSM should be fine, since it’ll benefit everyone involved if they continue taking in profits.",0,0.518,POSITIVE,0.761

Otherwise, buy indexes. If you don't understand fundamentals you will lose a lot of money eventually.Go to Amazon and read stock investment books.",0,0.54,NEGATIVE,1.0
