It has only proven effective in cost-cutting via biz procesd improvements but end-consumer demand wise, we've seen nothing good from it.ChatGPT hasnt been profitable at all and OpenAI even had to go lengths by making Chatgpt 4 free just to capture more of the market. But the service can never realize enough consumer demand since it is not an entertainment service, like social media. You cant capture the dumb masses otherwise.The REAL game-changer from AI only comes once robots can finally be incorporated. Aka the rise of androids. But it's also why I'm bemused so few robotics companies are trying to capitalizs on AI yet. At least in the US. Over at China, there's like multiple tenfolds more AI patents filed than in the US.

They are also really working on more complex things like creating graphs and previously time-consuming data analysis just from the user describing what they want (some of this already exists but will just keep getting better.)A specific example: they added AI to Microsoft Teams to automatically process what people say and translate that into meeting transcripts.

You can ask it, what is the relationship between performance and big five personality and it will synthesize an informed, up-to-date, summary of the most rigorous contemporary research.
