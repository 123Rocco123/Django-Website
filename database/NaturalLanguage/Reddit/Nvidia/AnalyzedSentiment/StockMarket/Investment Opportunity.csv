,"Hi Everyone, it currently seems as though the market is very volatile, but I feel like I am losing money every day by not investing in something else. Is there any current stock that we all agree is/will be on the rise in the upcoming months? The majority of my investments are in Amazon, Apple, Unity, and NIO. I have a very small amount of Nvidia, Lucid, and COTY. Is there anything I should add to further diversity my portfolio? I am still on the younger side, so I do not plan on holding on to any one stock for longer than 4-6 months. I am looking for a stock that I can divulge a portion of my paycheck Into for the next couple months. Thank you for your guys' help!","You're heavily invested in highly leveraged growth companies. Consider adding some consumer staples or healthcare as a hedge. ABBV has a very low correlation with the rest of your portfolio. For an uncorrelated growth play, CVS is interesting if they can manage to execute on their turn around.That said, on the order of 3-6 months, it's hard to beat some good old fashioned SGOV or VUSXX while you decide what you want to pull the trigger on. 5.3% is nothing to sneeze at, especially with valuations across the board being so high.",0,0.546,POSITIVE,0.73

If they can align their revenue centers they have a unique edge over their direct competition.Deep value is probably a better way to phrase it though, you're right.",2,0.527,POSITIVE,0.998
