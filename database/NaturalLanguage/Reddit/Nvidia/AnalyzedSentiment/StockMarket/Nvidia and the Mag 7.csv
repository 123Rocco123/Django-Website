,"As much as I love Nvidia, I feel nervous. Extremely nervous, not only has every analyst raised price target these last few days, Cramer raved about it last night along with Apple. The math is what has started to freak me out, with such a high multiple. Revenue growth is where I am struggling. Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and google are about 40 percent of the revenue. Revenue estimates are between 150 and 200 billion this year. I dont see how that can grow much more without Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon crushing their own profit. Capex goes right to the bottom line, so wouldn't those stocks go down if capex spending was greater than profit? Then drag whole market lower? Am I over thinking? Plus I hate when everyone loves a stock, who is left to jump on board?","Id suggest looking into why Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and google are buying these chips in largechances are their intentions are profit driven",0,0.526,NEGATIVE,0.74

If Wall Street finds out that revenue won’t be in line with estimates you will see the stock plummmet very quickly. In order for Nvdia to sustain its growth the assumption that AI is the future and that demand won’t falter and that it’s not something that will come and go like 3D televisions must hold true. Additionally, if AI were to become more widespread, the notion that more competition won’t enter the sphere, leading to Nvdia market share not decreasing must also hold true.In laymen terms you are gambling on AI becoming mainstream and widely adopted and for no other companies to arise to compete with Nvdia. If you feel that is reasonable then Nvdia is a sure fire bet.",0,0.548,NEGATIVE,0.677

But I haven't actually sold my very small position (now $10k) that I intended on adding to very aggressively as soon as the very short lull happened ~ Feb 18. Then by April 18 that it may be correcting. But it blasted off like crazy again! Everything (nearly) I actually do (vs. just thinking) turns out wrong with stocks.I'm holding. So ya may want to bet against me.Does anyone see any good opportunities in options betting on a price drop (selling covered calls maybe, if I had bought as much as I really wanted)? Any ideas on buying puts or selling calls with the intend to only buy and sell them (without covering or purchasing the stock)? Curious about any timeline you'd choose as well, obviously...

A company can spend $10 million on capex this year but that’s just transferring cash from one asset to another.
