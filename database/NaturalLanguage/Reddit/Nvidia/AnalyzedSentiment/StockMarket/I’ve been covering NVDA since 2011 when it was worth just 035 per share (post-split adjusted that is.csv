,"Update: Looks like we ran into sitewide issue right when things got started, I'll be back at noon ET to try this again! Hi! I’m Dan Howley, the tech editor at Yahoo Finance, and Nvidia has seemingly been at the forefront of virtually everything I’ve covered since ChatGPT hit the scene in 2022. I’ve been covering the tech space for 13 years and tracking Nvidia for even longer. I built my first desktop PC with an Nvidia graphics card in high school and have continued using its products ever since. Now I, like everyone else, am focused on Nvidia’s AI efforts, from reporting on how they’re dealing with the threat of increased competition to attending the company’s GTC conference to chatting with CEO Jensen Huang alongside my colleague Julie Hyman. With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia’s chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like AMD are gaining steam, and Nvidia’s own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant. How that plays out over the next few years is anyone’s guess. In today’s fiscal 2025 third quarter earnings report, Nvidia beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines on the strength of sales of its high-powered AI chips. 💵 Revenue: $35.08B vs $33.2B expected 💲 Adjusted EPS: $0.81 vs $0.74 expected 💾 Data center revenue: $30.8B vs $29B expected Nvidia also said it anticipates revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, for the fiscal fourth quarter. That's just ahead of Wall Street expectations of $37 billion. I’ll be back tomorrow, Nov. 21, at 10 a.m. ET to answer your questions about Nvidia’s latest earnings, the market reaction, and where the stock goes from here. That does it for me for today.

Now I, like everyone else, am focused on Nvidia’s AI efforts, from reporting on how they’re dealing with the threat of increased competition to attending the company’s GTC conference to chatting with CEO Jensen Huang alongside my colleague Julie Hyman. With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia’s chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like AMD are gaining steam, and Nvidia’s own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant. How that plays out over the next few years is anyone’s guess. In today’s fiscal 2025 third quarter earnings report, Nvidia beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines on the strength of sales of its high-powered AI chips. 💵 Revenue: $35.08B vs $33.2B expected 💲 Adjusted EPS: $0.81 vs $0.74 expected 💾 Data center revenue: $30.8B vs $29B expected Nvidia also said it anticipates revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, for the fiscal fourth quarter. That's just ahead of Wall Street expectations of $37 billion. I’ll be back tomorrow, Nov. 21, at 10 a.m. ET to answer your questions about Nvidia’s latest earnings, the market reaction, and where the stock goes from here. That does it for me for today.

I think one thing that the market might not realize is how important AI chips (which are more or less super high-powered GPUs) are going to continue to be going forward. Think what you will when it comes to the generative AI hype cycle, but AI more broadly will continue to a major part of our computing ecosystems for years to come. Whether its via something like ChatGPT, agents, or something else entirely, AI is here to stay.I think it's also worth pointing out that while the generative AI hype is massive, we've all been using AI for years already. Generative AI is just the latest iteration, and something tech companies are really excited to jump into.On the market being false side, I'm somewhat skeptical of the growth in consumer AI. I DO think there are useful applications of the technology, but calling every laptop with an Nvidia GPU or Intel NPU an AI PC and saying it's going to change your life right now...I'm not there yet. Maybe in the coming months as more apps roll out. But if my mom is asking for a laptop and whether it has to be an AI PC or not, I'm telling her it's not that important at the moment.",1,0.56,NEGATIVE,0.514

I can't recommend any particular stocks, because I'm not an advisor and the last thing I want to do is tell someone what to buy or not.BUT there are some cool companies in the space that I think are working toward taking on Nvidia. AMD is the most obvious one, of course. They've been battling Nvidia on the graphics front for years. They bought ATI Technologies to get into the graphics game back in 2006 and are pushing deeper in the server space. The company says its MI325X can go toe-to-toe with Nvidia's H200, but we'll have to see if customers want that.More broadly on the AI front, Qualcomm is looking to break away from being known as a mobile phone company and diver further into AI via laptops, auto, etc. Then there are the networking companies like Broadcom, etc.I think the main takeaway is that while Nvidia is the biggest beneficiary of the AI boom, there are other companies that are getting theirs too.",1,0.569,NEGATIVE,0.916

Now I, like everyone else, am focused on Nvidia’s AI efforts, from reporting on how they’re dealing with the threat of increased competition to attending the company’s GTC conference to chatting with CEO Jensen Huang alongside my colleague Julie Hyman. With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia’s chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like AMD are gaining steam, and Nvidia’s own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant. How that plays out over the next few years is anyone’s guess. In today’s fiscal 2025 third quarter earnings report, Nvidia beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines on the strength of sales of its high-powered AI chips. 💵 Revenue: $35.08B vs $33.2B expected 💲 Adjusted EPS: $0.81 vs $0.74 expected 💾 Data center revenue: $30.8B vs $29B expected Nvidia also said it anticipates revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, for the fiscal fourth quarter. That's just ahead of Wall Street expectations of $37 billion. I’ll be back tomorrow, Nov. 21, at 10 a.m. ET to answer your questions about Nvidia’s latest earnings, the market reaction, and where the stock goes from here. That does it for me for today.

First off, TSMC is building chip facilities in the US and that could help address potential problems related to tariffs, which could help Nvidia in the long run. The CHIPS Act is designed to bring chip manufacturers stateside, and the money is being allocated, though it's taking time for it to actually hit chip maker's accounts. There's also the question of what happens if China decides to move in on Taiwan. Doing so would send a massive ripple effect through the chip industry, not just Nvidia alone.Trump previously said he didn't like the CHIPS Act and that the US should have just put tariffs on chips from Taiwan. Speaker Johnson previously said he would repeal the legislation, before backing down after an uproar.At this point, I think we have to wait to see what president-elect Trump decides to do.",1,0.545,NEGATIVE,0.719

It's been fighting the company for years in the commercial market and it's got a solid lineup of competing chips via its MI300X series. Nvidia, though, still has an incredible market share. Estimates vary, but it's anywhere from 70% to 90% of the server market.But cloud providers like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, which make up a huge amount of Nvidia's sales, have to provide competing chips that their customers might want access to. So, AMD isn't exactly locked out of the market.
