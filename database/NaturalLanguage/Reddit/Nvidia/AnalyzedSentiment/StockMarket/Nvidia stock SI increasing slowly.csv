,,"I donâ€™t have a phd or postdoc in economics and finance so my word have zero credit: however the source I read and people podcast I listened to have their own credits. I just point out a few things: struggling in commercial real estate, hundred of thousands home owner losing their equity due to recent home price stagnant and dropping. Labor cuts due to transition of automation, uncontrolled national debt and interest rate together with bad loans. We just need a small trigger for the chain reaction happening.",5,0.503,NEGATIVE,0.995
,,"In all fairness the people with the educational background you mentioned still canâ€™t predict when an economic downturn will happen.Iâ€™m a firm believer in confirmation bias, if you believe itâ€™s the end of the world you will see negativity everywhere. Most of what you mentioned seems to be marginal in my optimistic opinion!Commercial RE- known issue due to remote work and isolated to office space. Multi-family, industrial, and even retail are doing well.Residential RE- Still low supply and a lowering interest rate will help prop-up already inflated prices. Definitely more concerning than commercial.Automation taking jobs???- isolated to tech compounded with remote outsourcing. The job market as a whole is tight. Which isnâ€™t great either. Maybe software engineers need to learn how to frame houses! lolDebt- whatâ€™s new??? Probably the most concerning part. I learned a long time ago Iâ€™m not smart enough to understand how the governmentâ€™s budget works.
