,Sorry if this question makes no sense‚Äî I bought a call on NVDA to expire the 22nd (position in pics) and found a article from nvidia will pay its next quarterly cash dividend on the 27th if you were a shareholder on record from the 6th. Is it possible to roll my position to earn that dividend?,"Not to skirt around the question, but we're talking about $4 for the dividend if you have 100 shares of NVDA which is worth over $900 per share. I don't think you should let $4 out of $90,000 sway your strategy much either way.That said, owning a call, no matter the expiration, doesn't entitle you to dividends unless you exercise your call. Again, the 0.004% gain doesn't seem worth it.",0,0.547,1.0,NEGATIVE
