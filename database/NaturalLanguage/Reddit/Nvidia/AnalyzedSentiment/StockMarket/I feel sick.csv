One night I got the bright idea and said ""well, I could just pay it off if I don't use it."" Three clicks later I had an approval and the money in my account a day later. It was scary fast. Predatory loan doesn't even begin, I didn't even have to say what it was for.

Any Recommendations?,"So in the picture it says he bought 7 NVDA contracts, he's not buying the actual stock, it's more like he's being loaned it from the 25th until the 27th.As far as I know there are two main types of accounts; Margin Accounts, and Cash accounts. He, at the moment has a ""Margin Account"" meaning that he can day trade to his heart's content, as long as he has 25k or more in his portfolio. Meaning that he could buy those 7 contracts, and sell them within a few minutes. It's great because you CAN make money like that and you don't run thr risk of holding the next day and possibly losing said profit. For example, let's say he has 30k in his account, and he buys 25k NVDA Call contracts, and he waits a few minutes for the market to do it's thing and sells it for 28k. As soon as he sells he can use that same amount to buy some more contracts of whatever company. There's some possibility to make a lot like that, or lose lol... because your funds are readily available. If you do not have 25k in your account though, you'll only be permitted to make the max of 3 same day trades, or else you'll get your account banned, that's called Pattern Day Trader rule(PDT).A cash account on the other hand is a little, let's say he has 10k in his account and he buys 8k worth of Contracts, and he sells it after a few minutes for 15k. He will not have the money he used until the following day when the market opens. With a cash account you don't have to worry about PDT because well you can only play with what you have for the day.So the issue OP is having is, he probably already used all three of his allowed trades for the day, and he probably wants to sell the profit he makes because he's worried about it becoming negative tomorrow, due to NVDA being very Volatile. He can probably still sell and get off with a warning. They usually give people a warning for doing this for the first time, but repeating the offense is where the issue lies and can get him banned.Anyway man, I hope I didn't make too many typos and it made sense to you.EDIT: got some clarification from another user. You won't get banned, your account will be restricted",3,0.528,NEGATIVE,0.991
