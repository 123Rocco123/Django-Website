,,"you don't own crypto unless it's in your own wallet.you're mixing ETFs that have a lot of overlap. Stick with the sp500 ETF as it has a lower MER. It's diversified enough and have been strong gainer over the past like 40 yearstech tech tech tech. That's all I really see. Great if you're bullish, but you need to be aware things can go south quickly, if you don't have diversity, you need to be comfortable seeing the deep red. It can happen.I feel you're gambling more on sentiment than fundamentals. I would sell everything outside of your sp500 ETF and dump the funds into that. Unless you're working full-time in finance, you don't have the knowledge to stock-pick. You may get lucky, but you won't beat the sp500 over time",0,0.521,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,"Thanks friend, I really appreciate you taking the time to comment. With regards to Crypto, yes, I am aware if it ain't in my wallet I don't own it, however... I have these Crypto ETFs in a tax free savings account and at the moment I can't justify having more of my own Crypto (I own BTC, ETH and SOL) and then get heavily taxed on my gains. At the moment, I am taking advantage of the contribution room I have and once it's maxed out, then I'll move on to having more of my own coins.With regards to tech, I am such a slut for tech as I work with it. But yes, I understand. I'm definitely going to diversity some more.",1,0.519,NEGATIVE,0.846
,,"Don't listen, please. You're taking advice from someone that doesn't know your timeframe. Ambition for growth, tolerance for risk, etc etc etc.If you have as much as a desire for tech as I do. You double down on your beliefs, not move away from them.You're 30, not 60. You have SO many years to let your money work magic, invest as aggressively as you can while you are young.Settling down, diversifying. All that stuff can be shifted at a much later stage.I'm s tech lover and believer and I've recently even sold all my ETFs to further double down on tech.Portfolio: Nvidia Tesla Google Adobe BitcoinThe end.Turned $55,000 into $169,000 in just over 4 years with my stocks and enjoying every day of it, even with the rollercoaster ups and downs. My crypto has gone from $6k to $14k (i barely touch this account.. have been putting like $50/fortnight automated transaction for like 3 years or something.The only problem with these stocks having massive corrections from time to time is:If you don't know why you're in the stock, then you'll panic and want to sell. If you believe 100% in the stock, then you'll get excited by crashes and buy even more!If you don't have cash on the sidelines to double down when corrections happen. I used to get excited and whenever I got paid, i bought stocks right away. I now split it 50/50, invest half, keep half on the sidelines to build up a kitty for any major correction that I want to take advantage of!Diversification is not for everyone, so don't just believe the hype because every single person tells you to. Follow your vision and your passion. It has its clear benefits FOR sure but don't feel shame for holding a small handful of strong positions and sticking to your guns.You're investing in the best businesses in the world afterall, not Penny stocks. Have confidence!https://www.avendus.com/india/avendus-eye/diworsification-the-trap-no-investor-should-fall-intoA good read about diversification.

,,"I have actual crypto holdings. I also have BTC ETFs and crypto miners in tax free savings account, and retirement accounts.I agree with your strategy. I like big gains in my tax free account, because there's a limit on how much i can deposit but (for now) no limit on how much can be in the account, so it's the best way to get big gains tax free.That said, I got rid of my ETH ETF, maybe it was wrong, but it seems underwhelming to me.but yeah, you're a tech slut...maybe diversify a bit. Financial sector should to ok with rate cuts or everyone's favorite VOO. I personally am on the small cap train with the Russel 2000.",2,0.529,NEGATIVE,0.939

,,"You need to alocate more money into the S&P500 index ETF. That should be your main investment. Do not get desperate about making money, take it slow.Try to make your next investments into the S&P500 and focus on that only, even if you lose oportunities in Nvidia or other stocks. Try to reach atleast 50% of total invested money in the S&P500 index ETF.That is one important step into risk management.",0,0.529,NEGATIVE,0.999
,,"All of these are highly correlated - if one is moving up/down, the others are likely doing the same - and many have overlapping holdings (NVDA is almost 4% of VFV, and over .5% of XEQT).This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I'd be sure that you're okay with this level of concentrated risk.For an example of how you could mitigate this while also maintaining global exposure, you could swap out XEQT for VXUS/IEFA or similar, which have lower expense ratios and exclude US and/or CA equities. Not really a big change in risk/fees on $188 CAD, but food for thought.",0,0.513,NEGATIVE,0.996

,,"The largest step in investing is doing it, so congrats on that. I'm not going to advise particular stocks to invest in. Sounds like your crypto sentiment is pretty solid, my strategy has been to find companies that have measurable value that I foresee playing large role in the future economy. Avoid the FOMO from the regards putting all their life savings into a shit coin and getting lucky.I am concerned for a period of stagnant market action once this run concludes but that's purely speculative so take that with a few grains of salt. I'm personally going to consider divedends growth stocks for now",0,0.547,NEGATIVE,0.988

,,"You’re doing just fine. Although I’ve been investing for a while, I too started investing in US equities around July-August, and I feel I got lucky because the market had just corrected because the Yen Carry Trade had unwound (5th August), and I bought the dip.I see you have the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. I’d say that’s a pretty smart move to get an exposure into Crypto as a newbie. I did the same. I have IBIT and ETHA by BlackRock instead of Fidelity ETFs. I got Crypto ETFs instead of actual Bitcoin and Ethereum because they’re taxed as usual equities, which is significantly lower than taxes on Cryptocurrencies in my country.NVIDIA is also a solid pick given that it’s the market leader in its space. You might see it fly for obvious reasons but I wouldn’t recommend buying more at higher levels. But were there a dip, I’d accumulate more.Hope that helps :)",0,0.518,POSITIVE,1.0
