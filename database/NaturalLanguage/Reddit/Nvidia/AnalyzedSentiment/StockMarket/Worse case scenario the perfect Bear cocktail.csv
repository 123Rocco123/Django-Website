,"After reading all the comments from my last post and doing some more thinking. I decided to entertain the idea of what would be the perfect Bear cocktail that could trigger a Stock Market destabilization. I'm not taking into account any type of positive news. I'm simply going the negative route, in a slow and systematic manner, without any huge trigger events. What am I missing and at what dates that's important and could also add to this? If you notice in the prior post list, three out of six times... rising interest rates were part of the cause that brought the market down at least 20%. Oil price shocks two out of 6. Then there´s speculative investments at the dotcom bubble. Covid, overvaluation, trade tensions... Stagflation. So these have to be in the mix one way or another: Cocktail Potential Ingredients: Rising interest rates. Oil price shocks. Speculative tech investments. Overvaluation. Trade tensions. Stagflation. New round of Covid-19. Housing or Commercial Real Estate Bubble. So this is the speculative worse case scenario we could have without going as far as having a WWIII: February 13, 2024: CPI report comes in hot. S&P500 comes down 1.5%, some buy the tiny dip. February 15, 2024: Jobless claims rise. Doesn't alter the market but adds to the cocktail mix. February 16, 2024: A higher-than-expected PPI indicates increasing costs at the producer level, which can signal rising inflationary pressures. Producers might pass these higher costs onto consumers, leading to an increase in consumer prices and overall inflation. The Fed to consider tightening monetary policy more aggressively than previously anticipated to combat inflation. This could include raising interest rates or adjusting the pace of tapering asset purchases. Financial markets don't react negatively to a higher-than-expected PPI, as it they priced it in from the CPI report. February 21, 2024: Nvidia posts earnings, they actually do fine but investors realize that´s gonna be the ceiling for now so the stock falls 15%. Other tech stocks get stained by the fear, bringing the S&P500 2.5% lower. AI investment sentiments leans towards potentially speculative for now. March 12, 2024: February´s CPI report comes in hot again, causing Algorithmic trades to sell and bring down the S&P500 another 2%. March 19-20, 2024: FOMC Meeting gives subtext of potentially not bringing interest rates down yet. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterates emphasis on the central bank's commitment to combating inflation, even if it requires keeping interest rates high for an extended period. This brings down the market sentiment down and numbers another 1%. April 5, 2024: In a CNBC YouTube video report, experts delve into the complexities of the current commercial real estate (CRE) market. The rise of remote work led to a decreased demand for office spaces, the pandemic trained people to make purchases online, commercial real estate bubble starts to show symptoms of cracking up.
