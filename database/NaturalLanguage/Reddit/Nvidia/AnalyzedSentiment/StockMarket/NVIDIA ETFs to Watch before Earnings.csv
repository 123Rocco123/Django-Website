,"With NVIDIA reporting earnings today, ETFs with the biggest allocations to the company may be a good play. Here's a quick list: Grizzle Growth ETF (DARP), Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF (SHOC), VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH), Invesco PHLX Semicoductor ETF (SOXQ) TrueShares Technology, AI and Deep Learning ETF (LRNZ) Here's a link to a Yahoo Finance article about it: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-etfs-buy-ahead-q1-161500070.html I've been looking these ETFs ex. DARP - NVIDIA is their top position at 19.4% of assets. They also have exposure to the underlying commodities that are in the chips, following the ""Energy Transition"" growth theme we've seen companies move to over the past couple of years. NVIDIA's earnings today are going to be important to the market, I think a lot of people will decide to buy in and believe the macro cycle for AI will continue if they beat earnings. If not there will probably be a pullback on the tech side but I think NVIDIA will beat, based on their rapid buildout of infrastructure so far. Ex. As data center demand continues to rise, their revenue generation q-o-q will continue to grow.",SMH needs to be rebalanced. SOXL has a lot better balance between companies.,0,0.531,NEGATIVE,1.0
