,,"Almost every reply is wrong, posting here nobody‚Äôs replied the correct answer, except u/felunk saying it could be settlement transaction.Public company‚Äôs stocks trade on a public exchange like NYSE or can trade privately between parties called as block trade at agreed upon prices, called as block trades. Stock change hands at agreed upon prices and such trades are unaffected by then-bid/ask.Exchanges ‚Äúreport‚Äù these trades after the fact and hence our orders are not affected by them.",0,0.52,NEGATIVE,1.0

,,"That's my point. It's not that the order itself distorts the price, but they send signals. (Not talking about this case in particular, just in general)I was just giving a random example. Obviously, institutional investors will be the only ones (or the immense majority) that can move 400M shares in a single trade, but how would that make you feel?The fear that the market knows something you don't propagates like fire and no one wants to be the last asshole to hold",6,0.526,NEGATIVE,1.0

,,What's wrong with Market orders?,4,0.61,NEGATIVE,0.979
,,"That's actually a great question. And as long as you're not trolling me here's your answer.Buy @ market with no top limitWhen the market is moving fast you may get a bidding offer spread of a .75 and let's say that the market is 103/103.75 the breakout point is $104, you want to buy it right as it breaks $104.25 , so you place your order buy limit 104.25 this way you don't overpay for the trade.Now there are other Small tricks here, MIT ( market if touched ) exactly as it sounds, it becomes a market order, but you can stipulate that the market order is actually a market order with a limit. That's how you trade the breakoutsWe can get more complicated than this, this is generally the right concepts.One of the more advanced concepts is fill or kill. Which is a market order with a limit and asking for a specific amount of stock at that range price. The order only lasts for a moment at the price that it's asking.'All or none' is similar but slightly different. The time limit is for the entire day but it must be one solid trade. The advantage of all or none is that you can collect 25 different sellers or buyers, all agreeing to a price, to fill the trade. So you get filled in one shot by 25 different sellers.",5,0.553,NEGATIVE,0.979
