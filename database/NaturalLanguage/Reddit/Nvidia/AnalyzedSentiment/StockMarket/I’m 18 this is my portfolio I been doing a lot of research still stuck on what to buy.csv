,,"Really recommend just a good value ETF to dollar cost average. SCHD just split today, that’s a great one to start with. I’d buy specific companies when you have more $$ in your account. Always good to start somewhere. I’m a fan of SOUN too!",0,0.534,POSITIVE,0.956
,,Thank you I have thought about buying it after seeing that spilt but I was a little discouraged and also what made you a fan of SOUN everyone has their own reasons just want to know yours.,1,0.524,POSITIVE,0.635
,,"I'm a fan of SOUN at $3. I mean there's growth potential there, they have good contracts. No moat and still very small company.",2,0.627,NEGATIVE,0.954
,,"Careful with SoundHound pal, the company is trading at an absurd 32x multiple on annualized revenue…far above the SaaS industry average of ~6.3x. Not financial advice, dyorSource: Software company valuations (EV/Revenue vs YoY growth%)",0,0.586,NEGATIVE,1.0

,,"If a lot of research tells you to chase after tech stocks after they have already reached almost all time high, it might mean you haven't experienced many sector rotation in the stock market industry.This risky strategy is suitable if you only invested a small amount of capital or you are already financially stable.Do you have enough emergency funds set aside from the risky strategy? Or can your parents support you during a downturn?",0,0.539,NEGATIVE,0.965

,,That's great. I suggest a more risky strategy. I recommend only keeping 1k in a HYSA and invest the rest in $VOO.,2,0.513,NEGATIVE,0.997
,,that’s seems insane no?,3,0.503,NEGATIVE,0.983
,,"I would not do that. Maybe 2k-2500 to start with then add periodically as you continue to earn. Keep the rest in the bank in case of emergency. Car breakdown, good start on a down payment towards something even. Heck my first house my down payment was less than 10k.Don’t drain it all I’ve made that mistake!",4,0.511,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,"Thank you man I wasn’t going to do that it seem insane, I particularly think just because I’m young I shouldn’t take huge risk a lot of people say you’re young take that big risk but that 10-18k I may have can help me in the future also. Thanks a lot for the advice",5,0.516,NEGATIVE,0.996
,,"I'd argue the opposite, go low risk because you are young. you have time for that money to grow at a healthy pace. when you are older and can afford it, start making some controlled plays for bigger gains on individual stocks.",6,0.52,NEGATIVE,0.937
,,"No problem! The other comment by proof is agree with as well. It’s so hard to make the money when you are younger. I had 10k at 19 saved and poof GONE from putting all into something at once.Being young and being risky to me means once you have a legit paying job/career (hopefully during your twenties) then you can invest more heavily because, like proof said, you can then afford it.",6,0.53,NEGATIVE,0.995
,,An ETF at this point haha,0,0.505,NEGATIVE,0.943

,,"Thats why you just pick one.SCHB, VTI, VT, VOO, SWPXX, who the hell knows…Or you can pick certain ETFs like tech sector, health sector etc… and not buy individual stocks.Lots of options!",2,0.525,POSITIVE,1.0
