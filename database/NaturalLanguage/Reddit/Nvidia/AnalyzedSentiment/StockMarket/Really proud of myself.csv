Talk about real dollar signs and you won't even dare have the balls to. OP, give it perspective on how long it takes for you to make X dollars after taxes. 10k? Couple weeks or couple months? What could you buy with say 5k? A lot of nice dinners, a semester of college, a drivable car.

Have you ever tried to operate a real account? Because there is simply no comparison between sim and live.Keep going with the simulation though.

A news squawk is used by traders to understand the fundamental driver behind market movements, such as live macro economic news coverage during the release of these, how it affects price movement, and much more. It's basically not safe without it. I have been through a few, and the only I can truly recommend is ""FinancialJuice"". They also have an app for both iOS and Android. They're basically highly educated economics personnel, covering live news for you with very short delay via live voice streaming. They cover Reuters & Bloomberg terminals, which cost 25k$ per year, who owns that besides banks and journalists? I think they charge 99$ per year..
