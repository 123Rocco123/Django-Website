,"As the title says I'm new to the stock market, and have only been investing in it for about 4-6 months now. I currently have 12 different stocks in my investment portfolio, which I invest $25 into each stock on the 1st and 15th of each month so in total I invest $600/month into the stock market. I have two questions: 1.) Is 12 stocks a decent amount for a diversified portfolio? and 2.) Is $600/month a good amount to invest every month since I plan on being a long term investor I'm talking 30+ years of investment. Also below I have listed the 12 companies i currently have stock in: Byrna Technologies INC. (BYRN) / Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST) / Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) / Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) / JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) / Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) / Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) / Walmart Inc. (WMT) / NVR, Inc. (NVR) / Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Hold B (BRK.B) / Apple, Inc. (AAPL) / Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Edit: I should also note my stocks are in different sectors of the market ie. AI, Healthcare, Finance, Defense etc...","Won't comment on the specific stocks, but I do wonder if your general approach to investing would be better supported by a strategy built around purchasing ETFs like the S&P500, which will have optimised and managed proporitions of the stocks you've taken plus many others.",0,0.528,NEGATIVE,1.0

It's great to see that you're taking a systematic approach to investing and thinking long-term. Let's address your questions:Is 12 stocks a decent amount for a diversified portfolio?While 12 stocks can provide some diversification, it's generally considered a relatively small number for a fully diversified portfolio.Your selection includes several well-known companies across different sectors, which is a good start. Here's a few points to consider:Concentration risk: Some of your selections (like NVIDIA, Apple, Amazon, Tesla) are in the technology sector, which could lead to overexposure to this area.Company size: Most of your selections are large-cap stocks. Consider if you want exposure to mid-cap or small-cap companies as well.Geographic diversification: Your current selections are all U.S. companies. You could consider international exposure.Bonds and other assets: Depending on your risk tolerance, you could consider adding some bond exposure or other asset classes for further diversification.Is $600/month a good amount to invest?The amount you should invest depends on your personal financial situation, goals, and other commitments. That said, consistently investing $600 per month over 30+ years can potentially lead to significant growth due to compound interest. The fact that you're starting early and planning for the long term is very positive.For many investors, especially those just starting out, index funds or ETFs can be an excellent way to achieve broad diversification with a smaller initial investment. For example, an S&P 500 index fund would give you exposure to 500 of the largest U.S. companies in a single investment.Some brokerages, like M1, offer the ability to create custom portfolios of both individual stocks and ETFs, which could help you maintain your current investments while adding broader market exposure.This is not investment advice.
