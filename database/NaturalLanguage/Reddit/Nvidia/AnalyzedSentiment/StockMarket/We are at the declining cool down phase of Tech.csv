,"We have had a crazy run since October of last year and it seems now we are cooling down for the foreseeable future in major tech stocks. Summary: UBS downgrades rating on Big Six tech companies (excluding Tesla) to neutral from overweight. Grouping includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Nvidia. The group has dropped 8% from its April peak, having surged 117% from Jan. 2023 lows. Nvidia fell 10% as AI stocks retreated. Earnings per share growth expected to slow to 16% from 42%. COVID-19 pandemic caused an asynchronous earnings cycle. Deceleration in large cap tech and acceleration in mid cap tech may lead to a reversal in stock leadership. Non-tech companies expected to see earnings shift from a 3% fall in Q1 to a 19% fall in Q1 2025.

I think large cap tech will swallow small cap and emerging tech companies via acquisitions and mergers. I don't see any current small caps dethroning the mag7 in my lifetime. I also think some of your points aren't actually indicators of anything at all. An 8% dip L4W after a +100% jump YTD is actually expected and not a broader indication of sector performance, current or future.   NVDA's fall was based more on sentiment than fundamentals, probably why it jumped +4% today.   Not really sure why you went with this post title just to backpedal entirely with your last point. Honestly a weird post, not sure where you were trying to go with this. ",0,0.523,1.0,NEGATIVE

But will large companies purchase small ones generally and continue to perform (is Cisco a good example of this)? Or will small companies generally disrupt the larger ones? Historically, small cap has performed better, true, but not for quite some time. Does this mean small cap is going to turn around right away? I just don't see that. The amount of capital necessary right now to innovate is larger. That typically comes from large groups. Eventually the innovation curve will shallow and more large opportunities will open for small companies. That's the point where small cap has opportunities",6,0.519,1.0,NEGATIVE
