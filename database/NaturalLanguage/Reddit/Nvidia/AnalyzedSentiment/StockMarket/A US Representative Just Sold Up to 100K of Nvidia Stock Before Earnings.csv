,,"I worked at a megabank and by law we had to preclear ALL of our trades, had holding periods, and were restricted from trading any securities the bank had any interest in. I was just some random IT guy with no inside information. It‚Äôs criminal our congresscreatures can do whatever they want with all their access and influence. That and term limits are just about the only things people agree on no matter which party they usually vote for",2,0.508,1.0,NEGATIVE

,,"If you look at the net worth of Congress, of lawmakers, compared to their income, they do not work for the people that elected them, they work for their brokerage accounts.They care about companies making more money.All lawmakers, federal and state, governors, the president, scotus, should be forced by law, bc we saw trump didn‚Äôt sell off his stuff, to have everything in a blind trust.They sold all their stock in January of 2020 and bought it all back in march, they bought lockdown stock like zoom and Cisco and others, they bought stock in the vaccines approved and the therapies approved, and sold when things changed.They‚Äôre constantly dramatically ahead of the market.It‚Äôs ridiculous that they‚Äôre allowed to do illegal shit for one. But also it‚Äôs a conflict of interest for any political leader to have stock in companies.Maybe candidates for president too, like truth social makes -1.2 billion a year, it‚Äôs ripped off open source software, mastodon, made less confusing, they ripped off Twitter user interface, so even Trump could understand‚Ä¶ the only value it has is bytedance bought a bunch, and now Trump is against a TikTok ban, he was for it before, so it just shows the conflict.Oligarchs, oil money, all funnels into his campaign and legal expenses.It just shows what can go wrong.",3,0.54,1.0,NEGATIVE

,,"I think the issue is that options are useful as a hedging tool. So hedge funds and wealthy investors can use them to protect against market downturns. That‚Äôs a legitimate use of options, and it‚Äôs hard to still allow that while also preventing them from doing more WallStreetBets type option trades",5,0.53,0.965,NEGATIVE
,,Let's be clear I am 100% fine with non-politicians trading options. There are already options with politicians picking stocks - being able to get into the options (AKA stock on steroids) just seems so much worse and ripe for abuse.,6,0.534,1.0,NEGATIVE

,,He should have held.,3,0.505,0.737,POSITIVE
,,"The real issue is that the SEC & other LEO‚Äôs don‚Äôt enforce and prosecute obvious trading that is based on non public information such as what Nancy Pelosi (and others) have done on numerous occasions.I don‚Äôt think that otherwise innocent people should have to give up their rights and freedoms to try to balance the scales and box people in all because of dishonest and immoral people‚Äôs actions that escape prosecution.Public officials should be held to the highest standards and aggressive enforcement to all self dealing, self enrichment, and corruption is the real answer.",2,0.506,0.972,NEGATIVE
,,What information was Pelosi using exactly?,3,0.504,0.998,NEGATIVE

,,"There are several documented instances but one that I remember is buying large amounts of credit card companies stocks (like Visa, Master Card, AMEX) or options a couple of days before a major vote on legislation that would have negatively effected these businesses and obviously the legislation failed sending the stock soaring.IDR the exact amounts but it was like $200K-$400K in a very short timeframe, like a few days.I am sure there is a plethora of information on the web if you want to search out the various instances in which she has benefited like that.I am not being political because there are instances of others doing similar things in both parties, however she is a serial abuser.She will say that the trades and investment decisions are nit made by her and are made by her husband however it is statistically impossible that there isn‚Äôt an exchange of information because it happens too often and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any instances where they lose money.",4,0.514,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"You're misrepresenting what happened with the credit card legislation. The Pelosis bought over $1 million worth of shares over a 3 month period, mostly at the higher price after it popped, and they held almost all of it long term (they sold some at a loss). They didn't buy a ton in a single day, wait for it to pop, and then sell for a profit like you're implying.",5,0.552,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"I was very clear in stating that I didn‚Äôt necessarily remember all the vivid details, the CC stock isn‚Äôt the only instance of this type of activity.If that was the only incident I would give the benefit of the doubt however there is a several of them, so it becomes the preponderance of the evidence by which I draw my conclusions.I don‚Äôt think the timeframe is that important because she is in a position to know how the votes are going to go and also in a position to influence the vote.The fact that ‚Äúsome‚Äù were sold at a loss isn‚Äôt really relevant when overall a large profit was made.I have sold at a loss for various reasons before, but my goal is to make money overall.Irregardless I think public servants should avoid even the appearance of impropriety and I admit that almost none of them act in that manner.It is well known that they go into government and their wealth skyrockets over a much shorter period of time than most any other person could do.I don‚Äôt disparage wealth, as long as it is achieved in a legitimate moral fashion.",6,0.526,1.0,NEGATIVE
