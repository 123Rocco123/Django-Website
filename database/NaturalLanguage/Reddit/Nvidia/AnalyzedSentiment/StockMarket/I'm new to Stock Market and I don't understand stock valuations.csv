,"Hey! I'm really new to stock market and trading in general. I""m mainly a programmer and only a bystander in trading. In 2020, I realized (even with all the controversy they had) Nvidia was doing really good, they also had their investments in a lot of technologies finally start to pay off and even if you exclude the c rypt0 frenzy it was somewhat clear that Nvidia was nourishing. At least to me as a programmer, I thought they had a ton of technological dominance and advancements in various areas. And especially in 2022 when AI stuff popped up, if it wasn't clear before that with all the research and investments they were doing in AI/ML space, like it should be clear by that point with image generation, LLMs and OpenAI popping off and all of them relying on Nvidia. But the stock price was still at 15 USD at maximum in 2022. At that time I had literally 0 knowledge in the stock market and thought ""Maybe this is Nvidia's value and this value includes all the new things and market is aware of Nvidia."" but in hindsight Nvidia was overly undervalued and the market was simply not aware of it. Maybe it was clear to me because Nvidia is in my domain but am I missing something? For example, I also get the same vibes with Tesla. Yes it is crazily valued at the moment but still with the event they held yesterday and overall their direction, even if everyone hates Elon Musk, it also seems clear to me that Tesla will pack a lot more than what it currently is. The robotaxis, tesla robot, their battery techs, their knowledge in vision and ML and a lot more things will start to pay off eventually. After the event, I expected today to see a growth in Tesla but it was down by %3? Is everyone waiting a lower point of entry? Or are people just not impressed by the event and the promises? What am I not understanding and missing here?","The reasons people sell vary. The common wisdom on the Tesla selloff today is that it was a sell the news type event.If you have the ability to wait, you will likely make money off buying TSLA today. For long range goals, like retirement, you are better off putting that money where many have already advised, a low cost diversified ETF.I think it's ok to have a little excitement on a long investment journey, just don't get too caught up in that side of your portfolio.",0,0.524,NEGATIVE,1.0

The market is in the late stages of a cycle and often fundamentals fly out the window.The hardest thing is trying to time these things. So the short answer is don't try to time them.So my advice is don't try to stock pick, don't go all wall street bets.

It's a good one that goes over much of the current bull case.Stocks like Tesla don't trade on fundamentals. Once you get into the mid cap space they are purely fundamentals.,1,0.528,POSITIVE,0.998

If you don't know how to value the business, you aren't investing; you are gambling.Tesla sells at 12 times the price of GM, made about 10% more TTM.Renthouse Analogy:GM Renthouse costs $100,000 made $10,000 last year.Tesla Renthouse costs $1,200,000 made $11,000 last year.Do you know the neighborhood is so much better that the rent growth will be eleven times higher over the next 5 or so years to make the investments about the same? This is the question you must be able to answer to justify the purchase price you are paying. If the rent growth is only four times higher, you are going to have a shitty investment in the Tesla Renthouse. If the rent growth is 20 times higher, the Tesla Renthouse will be the better investment.Knowing that the Tesla Renthouse is in a better neighborhood and will have better rental growth isn't nearly enough information.",0,0.556,NEGATIVE,1.0

If you can understand exactly how to value a bond, then it will at least provide a basis for stock valuation.

Then, you can take your valuations of real companies today, and freak tf out because the entire stock market is out of control lol. Good luck my friend.",0,0.553,POSITIVE,0.966

He's the same guy running tesla who just siphoned 9% of teslas market cap into a pay package.Nvidia is probably a better bet.

Risk in the stock market is a bell shaped curve for expected returns - being ""average"" is super easy - just buy a relatively representative index (or some studies suggest 30 random stocks from said index lol) and you will achieve average performance in the long run. Now if you buy an index *today* and then check in a matter of hours/days/weeks you may have below/above average performance, but ultimately over 10, 20, 30 years, you'll be sitting right at average as your risk distribution from the day you purchased the index is smoothed out.But with individual securities you have to try to figure out *where* you're sitting on the bell curve. For example, you mention $NVDA. After a huge run up, and the massive expectations placed on the stock, *and* the super positive guidance provided by management the *expected* returns from $NVDA are well to the right side of the bell curve (way above average returns). The problem is that this expectation is already placed on the stock, so if you buy NVDA today you are purchasing a stock that, by its price, the market is telling us will perform well above the average. Yet, your exposure to risk is substantially to the downside because you're sitting so far out on the right side of the bell curve the probability that you attain returns *less* than expected is far higher. The part of this that gets to people is that they may well buy NVDA today and still beat the index, but there is is also a huge amount of exposure to the bell curve (lower returns) that is well to the downside that you buy along with the stock.Let's take a relatively hated stock - like the Brazilian Iron miner Vale SA. They had dam failures that killed a lot of people, China is their biggest customer and their economy is slowing, and management has a tenuous relationship with their local government and their local government is heavily left-leaning and has a reputation for wanting to be increasingly involved in the company's decision making processes. They also are a capital intensive industry so they have a lot of debt, and as the equity has fallen in price their capitalization structure looks increasingly precarious. They also have currency risk as left-leaning governments of Brazil's type often engage in inflationary policies which could devalue their exports in the international market. But by the price the market is telling us it expects low returns from this company in the relatively near term. Yet, if we are sitting on a bell curve, our exposure to the left side of the curve is limited. We may still under perform the average, but we have a *lot* of exposure to the right side of the bell curve.The trick as an individual investor is to gain certainty regarding 1.) Where you are on the probability curve *right now* and 2.) If you slice up the curve, figure how likely are you to land somewhere to the right or left. Most people are biased towards finding themselves to the right side of the curve 3.) by some mechanism (research and modelling typically) try to decrease the amount of uncertainty about the future regarding the security, which allows you more certainty regarding the security's likely position on the curve.",0,0.54,NEGATIVE,0.999

Its latest improvements have been really great and maybe your view of Tesla's FSD relies on old versions.For robotaxis? Sure Waymo/Google are ahead but that's simply because Tesla haven't done it yet and we can't compare something that exist with something that doesn't exist.But what makes a great robotaxi? I would think one aspect is how good the self driving tech is (which imo Tesla is the leader right now), how cheap/scalable the vehicle is (Tesla uses only cameras instead of expensive sensors so this is one advantage and also Tesla is an automobile manufacturer and one that can scale things with automation in its factories, see how cheap the new tesla models are.), how good the ease of use features and overall the software and integrations are (Google can take the W here but I don't think Tesla is that far off. Their software isn't that bad and they seem to have good integrations already.) and finally the last point being how comfortable it is and the aesthetics. These are subjective topics but I think the car Tesla showed was more streamlined and had less clutter overall.For the robot, we simply don't know how much things are going on in the background. Maybe they are close to things they promote or they are so far off and only at the start, who knows. But the demo looked somewhat promising and even if they are far away from competitors in this category, they are doing pretty well in other categories and I think Tesla has a good shot at the robotics with the resource and knowledge it has. Also don't forget that Tesla consistently pulls great talent and also works a lot with SpaceX when necessary.",1,0.52,POSITIVE,0.919
