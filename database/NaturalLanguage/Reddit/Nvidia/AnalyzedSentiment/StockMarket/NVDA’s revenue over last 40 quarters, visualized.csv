,,Itâ€™s insane that they are only trading at 30 times forward earnings at that valuation. The margins of this company are absolutely appalling. I do wonder if someone will catch up in the next few years and provide a competitive product. So far in gaming itâ€™s been mostly NVIDIA with AMD always trailing it seems. Maybe AI will be different.

,,"The only thing close Nvidia is to the tulip mania is the speculation, but judging by their dominance and how no other competitor can come close to their proprietary CUDA software dominance in datacenter and AI, itâ€™s essentially a monopoly (unlike tulips where the upfront cost to grow one is nowhere near the engineering cost of AI software and chips, so barrier to entry in this industry is very high)",1,0.539,NEGATIVE,0.685
