,"Hello, I’m considering taking 5k from my 401k so I can play with the stocks a bit myself. Not much experience made some $ years back on the weed stocks. The stocks I was considering are GE, Nvidia, Google, and Tesla. Was going to maybe evenly contribute amongst these stocks. Any words of advice or stocks I should include/avoid? Short term return also applicable would consider selling and banking profits and leaving the initial 5k in the market. One more thing, a good app for stock trading? I’ve used Robinhood a bit and love the layout. I’ve had fidelity before it just wasn’t as simplified. I don’t like Robinhood because the stuff they pulled during AMC GME & and I turned stock lending on with the accidental click of a button. Not something I’d like to have investments in. Thank you ☺️","I recently got into the stock market and was skeptical of all the different apps. I landed on Robinhood because of everything I’ve read about them and the other apps. I understand the gme scenario and I was very concerned about that when getting Robinhood. I have not looked back since downloading Robinhood, it is super user friendly and good for learning about the market. Their options trading if you ever want to get into that is phenomenal and their trading is amazing. Goodluck and do your research. Good trading/investing",0,0.533,0.979,POSITIVE

Thank you ☺️","Why buy stocks that have already gone up dramatically? Why buy weed stocks? Or Bitcoin? There are stocks out there that will benefit on the Trump trade. Find out what they are. How about a stock like ""CAVA""? It's being called the next ""Chipotle"". It's up 70 a share in the last 3 months. Do some research, buy dividend yielding stocks. Pharma and Oil stocks are bad now because of Kennedy in HHS, and Trump's promise to increase supply and Saudi Arabia's likely increasing supply to bring down price to hurt our producers.
