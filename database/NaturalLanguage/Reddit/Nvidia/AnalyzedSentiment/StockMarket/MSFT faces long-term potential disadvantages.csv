,"I think one of the main reasons Microsoft is a great long-term investment is its long history of generating a lot of free cash flow. At the time of writing, the company's free cash flow margin is over 30%, with free cash flow rising from $15.9 billion in 2009 to $74.1 billion in the last 12 months. This financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments. While Microsoft may not seem like a value investment, in my opinion, its pricing is reasonable given its continued revenue and earnings growth, and it's likely to continue for the foreseeable future. I estimate EPS growth of 13% on a regular basis over the next 12 months. Based on this projection, I have a price target of $482.40 and estimate that the stock will trade at a non-GAAP P/E ratio of around 36. Looking ahead, I expect Microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15% over the next 5 to 10 years. While this prospect necessitates buying the stock at a fair valuation, I believe the current price provides an opportunity. The company's forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is only 6.5% above its five-year average, while its forward diluted earnings per share growth rate is nearly the same at 5.8%. MSFT faces long-term potential headwinds One potential challenge to Microsoft's long-term growth in AI is that its adoption can be cyclical. Currently, the demand for AI systems is high, which has prompted Microsoft and other big tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion. However, when the current trend peaks (likely due to macroeconomic constraints), growth may slow. According to the TipRanks risk analysis tool, Microsoft is exposed to 32% risk from legal and regulatory factors, which is higher than the industry average and could impact its AI operations due to increased scrutiny of data privacy and AI governance. Given this outlook, I expect some volatility in Microsoft's long-term growth trajectory, although it may not be as good as NVIDIA NVDA -0.06% ▼ and so on semiconductor companies so obvious. As market sentiment fluctuates, cyclical price and valuation declines coincide with temporarily lower growth rates and may provide more attractive buying opportunities. There is also a risk that Microsoft and other Big Tech players could over-invest in AI infrastructure. With 21% of its risk related to Tech & Innovation, Microsoft’s heavy investment in AI-driven initiatives, including data center infrastructure, could result in lower-than-expected returns if industry growth does not meet expectations. This may impact free cash flow margins in the medium term, contributing to further volatility.","I hate being the person complaining about formatting but seriously, no one is going to read a wall of text.
