There is no commercial viability, and won't be for a good decade. This isn't something that can be done at scale yet - and that ignores the fact that governments are going to be very interested in regulating quantum technology due to national security concerns which will only slow things further.It isn't going to take years because the technology is good or bad, it will take years because the infrastructure to build anything of this nature will take years to build. And then we have to build the machines that can operate these chips. Then they have to be further integrated into existing non-quantum based products.People see good, promising, exciting news and immediately buy the stock before asking 'will this increase EPS on the next Earnings report? In two earnings? Will it appear on their balance sheets next year?' If the answer happens to be no to those questions then the news isn't making the company a 'buy' now. It's making it a 'buy' in a few years time.Quantum computing is the next big frontier in computing technology and is going to bring radical changes over the coming decades. But it isn't going to have much of any impact on revenues this decade. (Again, regardless of whether the tech has been invented yet - for many other reasons of inertia)",2,0.555,NEGATIVE,1.0

Still no demonstration yet. Google's Waymo partnered with Uber, and has actual demonstration in California already. For quite some time now too. Google has been an AI leader because they spend a lot of time developing something quietly and robustly (a great strategy that Apple uses too).Quantum will be exciting to see, and a game changer if other companies draw from Google's tech.I'm bullish as well, but I expect a decline in browser share due to the recent antitrust investigations. Other browsers will and already have taken advantage by adding competitive features and privacy guarantees.10 years down the line this will definitely be a huge profit.

I assume you're referencing the google TPUs? Those are still manufactured by TSMC, like most of Nvidea's GPUs. They also don't produce nearly enough to be a viable replacement for something like blackwells, H100, etc..Nvidia also doesnt just sell them a GPU, they sell them the entire infrastucture hyperscalers require (software, gpu, cpu, networking, etc..). At the end of the day, TPUs need to be consumed by downstream customers - you need to write code that can both run and optimize use of those TPUs. Which really isn't feasible.Nvidea has a massive moat, and google not 'dependent' on them (which they very much are) isnt really a threat.Search Domination & Browser war winnerThis is kind of a moot point - searching and browsing only matter if that can be monetized, which they are doing really well already, and have been for a long time.

Namely as i pointed out:They aren't making nearly enough of them...Google consumes them internally.you have to find people who can develop on them...since they're only available in GCP, and use the Google ecosystem for dev (which is...err..not great...just starting up a TPU requires a manuscript for example) that is a very limited pool (also see point 1). GPUs are everywhere, and have CUDA (for NVDA) which means there's no shortage of devs for them.most downstream customers 'big corp inc.' are still using things like xgboost for their 'AI' tasks....no need for TPUs.TPUs, are awesome in their niche usecase, but they are no threat to GPU marketshare, and are, imo, not a huge factor in a bull case.",2,0.515,NEGATIVE,0.864
