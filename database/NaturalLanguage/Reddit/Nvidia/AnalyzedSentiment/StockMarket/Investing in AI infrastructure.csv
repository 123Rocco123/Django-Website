,"I’m interested in investing in the data centers, servers, and related opportunities driven by AI. What do you think? Individual AI software winners may be hard to pick, but surely the server farms are needed anyway. Is there an opportunity, and how are you exploiting it? With long experience in the software business I am aware that the AI world is maturing, but has a long way to go. I am sure we will see stories of AI-driven project failures. Equally, I’m sure we’ll see stories about great successes. But whichever way it goes there will be vast investment. So are you focusing your investments on AI platforms (if so, which), or hardware (Nvidia and others) or Data Center REITs (American Tower, Equinix) or things like the Global X ETFs (which seem underperforming to me).

Now anyone who is an active investor and has any focus on growth will have invested heavily in everything OP is interested in - I know I am. ETN; VRT; EME; EQIX; AVGO; LRCX; TER; ACM; KKR all lurk in portfolio somewhere for that reason - and I'm up over 100% on VRT and 200% on AVGO and NVDA in just a year or so.It's not necessarily that OP missed the boat - this is a long-term growth opportunity - but they certainly missed the first major leg up.,1,0.544,1.0,NEGATIVE

With internet any kind of crappy data exists. This is where a paraell multi core processor hardware becomes powerful in deep learning or internet of the things. It will search for most likely correct answer for you. But this is just the first generation of hardware enhancement in data mining. Needless to say there is all kinds of surprises and disappointments. To get it going we do not have enough electric power house to run these advanced i/o intensive servers which could create another global warming crisis. Right now 6G infrastructure etfs are just hanging here so one needs to look beyond these towers. Also medical AI studies showed the doctors are not using diagonosis data correctly and treat patients based on what little they know. We seem to have hit a limit on what can be done. It will definitely be evolutionary enhancements. Today Nvda is the driving tool but next few years you will see too many more players and servers out there. All the best,",0,0.527,0.987,NEGATIVE
