,Can i sell this 401k stock and buy nvidia? I’m new to stock market and living in US.,"Holy crap, a lot of bad advice here. Y’all if you know the stock is going to go down, then go make profit off it. You don’t know anything.OP, yes you can however investing your 401k into an individual stock carries a lot of risk and the general advice is to keep it in well distributed index funds. You do you, don’t listen to anyone saying you missed the boat… it could double in the next few weeks and you’d hear the same garbage that you again missed the boat.",0,0.535,NEGATIVE,1.0
,Can i sell this 401k stock and buy nvidia? I’m new to stock market and living in US.,"You're also clueless though lol. The investments available in a 401k vary from plan to plan and that selection is up to the plan sponsor/provider. There's a significant chance that this guy will not be able to trade individual stocks within his 401k.It also is reasonable to be wary of this strategy. OP is clearly not very knowledgeable about the stock market.. He likely doesn't even understand what the target date fund he's currently in is as he calls it a ""401k stock"". He's FOMOing his retirement into a company thats had a historic run to all time highs. He's pretty likely to want to sell it and chase the next big return if it dips 20%.This is the exact type of person who's best suited for a target date fund or index fund...set it up, leave it alone, make 0 changes.",1,0.547,NEGATIVE,1.0
,Can i sell this 401k stock and buy nvidia? I’m new to stock market and living in US.,"Let me recap your comment:1.) I’m clueless2.) investments vary in plans and it’s possible to trade individual stocks but high chance his plan won’t be able3.) OP should leave it and not touch itOkay, now go back and read my comment where I’m suggesting to not put a 401k into individual stocks.

If you just use simple total market or S&P 500 index funds, you’re pretty much going to be rich when you’re older.

,Can i sell this 401k stock and buy nvidia? I’m new to stock market and living in US.,"Honestly, that doesn’t sound like a great idea - a food truck. Unless your plan is to pivot into a sit down restaurant, but I’d consider that an equally bad investment. Restaurants are notorious for being high failure rate businesses. I don’t know, I think it’s just one bad move after another. Buying a stock at its peak, and then going to open a super risky business in a super risky industry.",6,0.53,NEGATIVE,1.0

,Can i sell this 401k stock and buy nvidia? I’m new to stock market and living in US.,Food is where everyone thinks about when going for a business. Not saying it will not work but you gamble again. There is money to be made but that involves hard work. At least I am not willing to do it but I also know that gambling is the worst!Also a good advice. Borrow money from a bank.

,Can i sell this 401k stock and buy nvidia? I’m new to stock market and living in US.,That’s some definitely weak interest on the 401k. Especially in this market atm. Love how much they talk about compound interest but it’s kinda hard to compound zero or even losses on these retirement accounts.I’d say just get yourself some ETFs either way that (VTI and or SPYEdit: I read it at a glance originally and noticed it was at last close.

,Can i sell this 401k stock and buy nvidia? I’m new to stock market and living in US.,"It really really depends. In general assuming you have pre tax money, youll pay your income tax rate on the withdrawal plus a 10% penalty if you're under 59.5. The withdrawal will also potentially not be available if you're still working at the company that sponsors it.Youll lose so much of the money to those taxes that it could only potentially be worth it if this debt is at an exorbitant interest rate, its seriously crippling you, and you have no other means of paying it off. It's also bad to set yourself back on your retirement.",1,0.538,NEGATIVE,1.0
,Can i sell this 401k stock and buy nvidia? I’m new to stock market and living in US.,"Find out how to take out a 401k Loan instead of withdrawing. With the loan you wont owe any penalties and when you pay back the loan the interest rate is usually very reasonable, and also goes back into your 401k itself.So basically the interest you pay is to yourself. Every 401k should have this option so just go through your jobs proper channels to do it.The downside to a 401K is you are paying back the loan with your money from your paycheck, so that means you're paying back the loan with taxed dollars... well one day when your 401K is ready and you withdrawl the whole amount, it'll be Taxed, so any loaned dollars are effectively being Taxed twice.That being said it's still massively better to take the loan if really need it, Rather than withdrawl any amount or to take some predatory loan.

,Can i sell this 401k stock and buy nvidia? I’m new to stock market and living in US.,Should be able to rebalance it...but don't put a 401k into a single stock.
