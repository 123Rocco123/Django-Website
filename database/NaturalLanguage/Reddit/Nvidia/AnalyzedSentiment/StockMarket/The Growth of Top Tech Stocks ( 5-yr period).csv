,,My dumb ass brain thought fintech was a way to go then realized i was a fucking idiot.,0,0.506,NEGATIVE,0.986
,,"I don't think that makes you an idiot at all. If you take a 5 year stretch from 2016 to 2021, FINX (fintech etf) was up ~250%. It just happened to crash recently. Who's to say NVDA or TSLA don't have a crash in the next 5 years?",1,0.548,NEGATIVE,1.0

,,"Stock price increases‚Ä¶idk why they call it growth, to me that implies the company revenues grew by the same amount‚Ä¶.Stocks are a scam sometimes, nvidia market cap 2.7trillion revenues 80b income 40b.. if they continue to generate 40b in income it would take 68 years to get to 2.7trillion.. thats a crappy return",0,0.578,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,"Revenue in Q1 was 26b, net income was 15b and both is supposed to grow further in the next quarters, therefore you are a bit off.",1,0.564,NEGATIVE,0.999
,,"It's supposed to grow, ok. So what ? Is it going to triple, quadruple and keep at that level for coming years ? I highly doubt that",2,0.517,NEGATIVE,0.992
,,Exactly üëç,3,0.5,POSITIVE,0.901
,,"The reason nvidia is valued so highly is because they are growing immensely fast, have a 90% market share in AI where we don't even know the limits of how big it will be. Assuming a net income of 40b over a period of 68 years is almost certainly not accurate.",1,0.583,NEGATIVE,0.861

,,I like to hike.,0,0.492,POSITIVE,0.997
,,Apple takes a lot of heat for their ‚Äúlack of AI investment.‚Äù What many fail to realize is Apple invested in AI capable hardware by putting the silicon in the hands of their users early. They are positioned to implement with a software update whereas their competitors aren‚Äôt postured on the hardware side.,1,0.531,NEGATIVE,0.986
,,I like to hike.,2,0.492,POSITIVE,0.997
,,The thing is companies like Google have barely even got started.Take Waymo. It is well ahead and going after a trillion dollar plus market.These big tech companies are going to be a heck of a lot larger 10 years from now.Take movie creation. That is going to go to Nvidia and/or Google as they will be the places with the silicon to be able to produce a movie once generative is good enough.So instead of spending on actors and sets and etc they will instead be paying either Google or Nvidia.Google with their TPUs and Nvidia with their AI processors.,0,0.539,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,The possibility of AI generated movies is extremely disheartening as a filmmaker,1,0.541,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,"I'm genuinely curious. Why do you feel that way?In my mind AI will function as a more advanced form of CG. CG changed filmmaking for sure, but it didn't destroy practical effects. Certain things are enhanced by CG, certain things are better done the old fashioned way.I could see AI enhancing filmmaking in much the same way. Potentially, it could simply replace our current capabilities with CG but live action shots may stay completely unchanged.Obviously, not a guarantee that this is the outcome. Who the hell knows what the future holds.",2,0.527,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,"I'm sure to an extent I'll be able to use it too, though I'd probably feel dishonest using shots entirely generated by AI. If it's video inpainting thats not as bad in my eyes.I guess a good specific example of why I'm worried is this- I've spent a lot of time researching cinematography and all types of filmmaking tricks, building skills over the course of months or years. What does this matter if an AI can just do it all perfectly with a few sentences? I know it's not at that point yet, but it feels like just a matter of time.You might say, well, those videos will feel robotic and won't have my ""personal touch"", or something like that, and I'd say thats a good point. But eventually, will people even care?I'm hoping this simply raises quality standards by making stuff more competitive, because I'm fairly confident I can rise with them. There's just a lot of uncertainty here.I hope I'm being overly anxious, but there's no way to tell",3,0.544,NEGATIVE,0.994
,,"I see what you're getting at. AI is on an exponential curve, so it's really hard to know how quickly it will be capable of something like that, or if that will even be possible.That being said, if AI gets to that point, I think humans are in trouble in general. Anywhere cool to see your perspective and looking at your profile it was cool to see some shots from the film you're working on. Best of luck!",4,0.545,POSITIVE,0.97

,,Heading for the oligopoly world where nearly the entire economy is controlled by a few huge players,1,0.515,NEGATIVE,0.626
,,Heading?I would say we are already there. But I agree it will get a lot more in the future.You are going to see companies like Google a lot more powerful a decade from now.Which is insane when you consider just how powerful Google is already.,2,0.516,POSITIVE,0.916
,,Exactly. These big tech companies will find a way to continue to grow. It's insane. Hoping for our stocks to grow with it.,1,0.547,POSITIVE,0.997
