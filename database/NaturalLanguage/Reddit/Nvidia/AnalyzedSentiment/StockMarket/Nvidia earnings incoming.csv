,,"It's just compound interest. The more capitol you start with, the faster you will get there. But if you're looking to day trade and do this. Its high risk, but high reward. If you want to invest for the long term, its the more secure but time consuming way.Have a look at stock indexes, which are public investing company's that hold large investments in most of the largest, tech, domestic, economic buisness'/corporatings. :Nasdaq100 : the top 100 technological company's in the US. Dowjones30 : 30 largest publicy traded company's. Russel 2000: smallest us stocks traded. Spx500: top 500 publicy traded company's in the US.If you trade on these. Keep on top of earning reports, geopolitical news, political news and these will be very good indicators on how the index will move as a whole. You can 20x leverage your orders. So if you buy and the index makes 1% in a day, because you have 20x leverage, you will accumulate 20% in a day. You can also short these stocks with same leverage. Meaning - if it goes down by 1% - you will again make 20% on your order. Because you're basically predicting it will lose money.You can go abit less volatile and look at doing currency.Gbp-Usd is probably your best to work with, but any currency is good tbf.On average a currency stock will move .4% +/- with a 30x leverage you can get. Making your order accumulate 12% in a day. Up or down, depending on what you predict.I would highly suggest using etoro. Using the virtual funds they give you. Practice for atleast 2 - 4 weeks. When you prove to yourself you can make 10% consecutively for 2 weeks atleast. I did 1 month. But 2 weeks on virtual atleast to understand the fluctuations. Then smash your money in there and go serious.This is just how I'm doing it. I'm not promising you will make insane amounts of money, nor will gain every time as the market is very volatile. But practicing with virtual funds will 100% put confidence in you to Then use real money. Hope to see a message In 6 months with a 1m in that account. ü´°üòâ",2,0.553,POSITIVE,0.882
