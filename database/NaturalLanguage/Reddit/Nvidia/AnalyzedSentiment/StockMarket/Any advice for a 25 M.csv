,"Reuse my old account recently, tried a lot but no self strategy.",It looks like you are underperforming the market and gambling with options. You are better off just sticking it on broad based etfs/bonds and forgetting about it. Just put it in 50% something like VTI or VT and 50% SCHO if you want to be conservative. Then rebalance annually. More % stocks and/or more bond duration if you want more risk,0,0.522,NEGATIVE,1.0

,"Reuse my old account recently, tried a lot but no self strategy.","Not advice. Just my thoughts. Bonds generally underperform stocks in the long run, but help diversify and generally hold up better during recessions. So they kind of help protect your portfolio. Sometimes they even outperform when you rebalance annually. Depending on the level of risk you are comfortable with, your time horizon, market conditions, etc... will determine how much bonds exposure you want. You just don't want to get scared and sell everything at the bottom of a bear market. I'm sure others in here have better input. Good luck with the investing",2,0.534,NEGATIVE,0.845
