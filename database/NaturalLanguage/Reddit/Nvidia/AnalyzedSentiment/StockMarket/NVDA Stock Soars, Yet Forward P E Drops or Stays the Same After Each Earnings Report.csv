,,"But it‚Äôs hard to say that Nvidia is overvalued given their performance. Their earnings per share continue to climb and their net income is up over 6x in the past 12 months. Their profit performance:2 years ago: $6B in EBITDALast year: $36B EBITDAThis year forecast: $70B+ EBITDASo profit is up roughly 10x and the price is actually up slightly less than 10x in that time. This is what, as a shareholder, you prefer over something that shoots up for no reason. As a trader it can make it difficult because it‚Äôs up SO MUCH which makes us think that it‚Äôs overvalued but the fundamentals actually back up the price.Will be interesting to see how their earnings today move the market. The numbers probably matter less than the forecast.",0,0.562,0.996,NEGATIVE

,,I‚Äôll agree with the overall thesis but also everything is made more efficient over time. We‚Äôve also not ever had this much demand for GPU power. Plenty of companies are seeing Nvidia printing cash so it‚Äôs only a matter of time before other companies eat into their market share or develop some type of efficiency breakthrough IMO.

,,It‚Äôs up 20% just this month. 100% past 6. Can‚Äôt get more sideways than that I suppose,2,0.514,0.917,NEGATIVE
,,"Feb 21 was last earnings - immediately the trailing PE ratio went down from 82 prior to earnings to 51 after earnings. The price started to rocket up from the earnings release on Feb 21 to March 7 when the trailing PE ratio hit the 70s. Once trailing PE ratio hit the 70s, it has bounced around not losing too much, not gaining too much. See:March 7, Nvidia was 927,March 25 was 950,April 9 was 853,May 6 back up to 921,May 9 back down to 887,May 15 to 946,May 17 to 924,and today it is 948 .... so gone down since March 25 ...Gone up 2% since March 7 (two and 1/2 months since price hit its wall with trailing PE ratio in the 70s) ...A 2% increase since March 7 is trading sideways in the last 2 and 1/2 months. As soon as the trailing PE ratio got into the 70s price increase slowed down. I would project it to do the same this time around. New numbers will bring down the trailing PE ratio to the 50s - expect price to go up until trailing PE ratio gets to the 70s again. That is what growing tech companies do.Just look at the historic trailing PE ratios ... in 2023 NVDA's trailing PE ratios were up in the 114 range for several quarters. Trailing PE ratio got up as high as 245 in July 2023. Here is a link to a chart showing NVDA's trailing PE ratios over time (look at last 5 years and last 3 years and last 1 year views - PE ratio has been going down in past year - May 2023 trailing PE ratio was 162 and price was 309): https://ycharts.com/companies/NVDA/pe_ratioPrice is better now than it was then - and it was trading between 200-400 in 2023.

,,So you were talking to yourself. Gotcha. Generally firms trade at about 20-30 P/E. I didnt check after their latest earnings report but Nvidia is trading around 78-80ish. The share price is divorced from the earnings per share because the market is assuming their future net income will grow substantially. The same was true of tesla at its peak. Investors believed tesla had such a head start on competition that they would be the dominant player in EVs and FSD.

,,So falling P/E with sideways price action means gains coming soon?,4,0.514,0.991,NEGATIVE
,,It‚Äôs important because when you buy a share of any company you essentially own a tiny piece of the business. And then you will sell that share at some point. The goal is to sell it for more than you bought it. Think about it as if you were buying a small business as a whole:If a business makes $100k profit and you buy it for $200k. You bought it at a P/E of $2. You can sell your company for more in a couple ways:grow the business but keep the P/E the same. Double the profit to $200k at a $2 P/E and you can sell the business for $400kconvince the market to pay a higher P/E. If you have higher expected growth or some product that is in high demand the market might be willing pay you more to capture that advantage. Let‚Äôs say it goes up to $4. Now at $100k profit you can sell it for $400k. If you can grow the business to $200k and have a higher P/E then you can sell for $800k. This is Nvidia.P/E ratios can be a sign that the market expects high growth. At some point the ratios get so high where the market will no longer keep paying the high price. Nvidia has both a growth advantage and a tech advantage. This should cause their P/E to go way up. But they keep outperforming even what the market expects which keeps their P/E relatively modest (given it‚Äôs growth).,1,0.577,0.828,NEGATIVE
,,"Your NVidia example is really good, and helping me understand where P/E is useful. I also wanted to point out that P/E is unitless. If you did have a unit, it would be $ per $.My confusion with P/E comes from negative and relatively low earnings numbers.P/E can become more negative despite showing less loss from one earnings call to the next. This is counter-intuitive and is due to the earnings encroaching on 0.Also, once a company crosses from loss to profit in their earnings report, they go from having a large negative P/E to a large positive P/E. This is also counter-intuitive.",2,0.558,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"Those are situations where P/E might not be super helpful. There are many ratios that investors use. I like Price / Revenue as well which is often helpful when P/E breaks down. Revenue will never be negative so you'll always have a positive P/R. It is sometimes less helpful when a company gets dramatically more profitable without increasing sales as much -- either because of cost cutting, new products that offer higher operating margins, etc. In that situation P/R will sky rocket because the stock prices probably went up a lot without sales going up as much.So it's really about finding what ratios matter in what situations",3,0.559,0.745,NEGATIVE
,,You care because of you. There are many metrics. People like what they like. You don‚Äôt have to follow if you don‚Äôt want to.PE is useful for comparison of similar companies in an industry. Like chip makers vs chip makers. P/E is basically price per pound. It‚Äôs harder to compare a bag of bananas that cost $5 vs 3 apples that cost $3. Price/LB or P/E helps you normalize the price of a stock.,1,0.533,0.998,POSITIVE
,,"I'm just trying to understand it's use. Sorry if I came off as uncaring.But that is an interesting take. Also explains the break down of the metric when you throw negative ""LB"" into the mix.",2,0.545,0.692,POSITIVE
