,Hey everyone After a long long hiatus and licking my wounds I decided to try trading once again. Recently I've been changing up my approach and doing 5-7 DTE spy options. And it's been going pretty decent however recently I got a couple of August 30th calls for Nvidia I managed to get in at a good position for 133 calls. My thesis is that it's going to keep pumping up to the day of earnings. I don't have any intention of holding the position up until expiration. My question is regarding theta decay and volatility. I know that the closer I got to the expiration the less profit I'll see as a percentage of my position. And I also understand that during high levels of volatility it can go both ways. And I'm not really asking for specific advice just kind of guidance or knowledge as to how that may affect my position. I'm holding them over the weekend and I'm expecting Monday to start off a little red but to finish off green and so I'm not quite sure if I want to sell half my positions and wait till earnings or if I should wait to earnings in general. I strongly believe that Nvidia is going to beat their earnings I just don't know how drastically that's going to affect the price action. Any and all input is definitely appreciated Thanks in advance,I mean I get where you are coming from. I guess I'm telling myself that what I'm doing now is better than what I was doing before (0dte out of money gambling).But like other commenters are saying I should have just started investing as soon as I recovered rather than saving up to try trading again. I definitely see how it's still essentially gamblingI guess I'm better off investing long term like opening an IRA rather than just relying on my 401K,0,0.549,NEGATIVE,1.0

But nvidia might experience IV crush after earnings which will cause some damage to your positions.Buying options for earnings is just gambling at the end of the day.

Any and all input is definitely appreciated Thanks in advance,I see I'm still mainly focusing on my 5-7 DTE options with SPY. I just thought there was some opportunity here but I can see how I'm basically just hoping for good news and equally good price action.Moving forward is what would be a better way to take advantage of at least make use of earnings events? Like are straddles or condors any better? I can't baby sit my position sadly which is why I'm playing with longer Dates,1,0.554,NEGATIVE,1.0

Honestly if you want to make money from nvidia write put options prior to its earnings release. This way you make money when IV drops and if nvidia kills it then you make free cash.,2,0.527,NEGATIVE,0.881
