,"I got a few questions as a newbie Some of the companies I want to invest long-term are either at their ATH or close to ATH, like Microsoft or Nvidia. I'm wondering whether I should wait for it to drop, because most of the stock market is green this year, so I have a feeling it may drop since it grew so much, what do you think? Some of it just recovered from 2022 to it's pre-2022 state, but Nvidia has 205% growth this year, which is crazy Index funds - the legendary S&P 500. Everyone says it's the most stable etc - but I've found other indexes with even better growth. SP500 usually have the 7-10% yearly return and last 5 years went up 56%, but for example the INDEX Vanguard Growth ETF went up 87% for the last 5 years - and it was also a steady growth, not a lucky spike during one period. What do you think, is it really smart to go with SP500 or are there other ones that are much better, even tho SP500 is so hyped by everyone? and if you agree - what other indexes with better return would you recommend? Leverage - I'm not familiar with how much can you leverage in stocks, but for people that invest in the top 10, which most likely will go up in the future, wouldn't be smarter to invest it with i.e 5x leverage, since the companies like Microsoft are stable, and eventually will grow? Stock Math - let's say I invest $10.000 in a stock and it declines -50%. I know have $5.000. If it goes up by 50%, do I get $7.500 or do I get my $10.000 back? Logically the first answer, but something doesn't give me a peace of mind here, so I prefer to ask Eli Lilly - what do you think about this stock? Growed massive amount lately, and pharmaceutical industry will definitely be there in 5 or 10 years.",Waiting MSFT to drop since it was 90bucks ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,0,0.497,0.999,NEGATIVE

If you look at its chart a couple or few years back it was stuck at 90-110. If I remember right it was stuck in that range for a year if not more. When the idiots here started calling it dead money I new it would break out.Same think with BRK-B. Got stuck in a range it didnâ€™t want to move out of I picked some up and shortly after it started upward mobility.BRK-B, apple, msft Tesla and smuckers have probably treated me the best. Well Home Depot and Netflix werenâ€™t bad either.Itâ€™s a shame I have a couple people at work who are into stocks (actually mainly crypto) it seems too many people are afraid of the market and think it just takes all your money. Iâ€™ve had losses and they taught me more than the winners. IMO everyone should have something in the market but of course with world events at the moment I just keep my mouth shut.",3,0.527,1.0,NEGATIVE

Best you can do is dollar cost average, if you have a large amount of cash you want to invest. If you don't know what that means, Google it.While VUG is up 90% over 5y, past performance does not guarantee future results. Also, VTI is basically VUG + VTV. It combines both growth and value stocks. Also, much of the recent gains of the S&P 500/NASDAQ this year have been from the magnificent 7. So big growth stocks like these have probably the least room to run, and the biggest room to fall back to Earth (mean reversion).Leverage is for short-term plays, not long-term buy & hold. Don't even worry about it until you learn a bit more about the market. It will just confuse you and amplify your losses early on. Also, fees on leveraged products are huge and will eat into any gains over time.This is basic math. If you have $5k, and gain 50%, you now have $7.5k. So you need a 100% gain to recover from a 50% loss.I have no clue, but if you're invested in the S&P 500, LLY is a top holding. So you'd basically be overweight LLY if you buy that on top of a major index. So you have to ask yourself if that's worth it or not.",0,0.544,1.0,NEGATIVE
