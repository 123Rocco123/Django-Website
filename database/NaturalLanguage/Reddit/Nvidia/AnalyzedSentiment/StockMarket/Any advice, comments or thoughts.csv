,"Hey all, 46 m divorced, new to this, hope this is allowed. I started this portfolio about 5 years ago just to play around. Slowly I've added and subtracted different things along the way and so far I'm fairly happy with it's performance even if the amounts arent overly impressive. It started as just stocks and only very recently added some etfs to the mix as well. Any advice or comments/thoughts? Some other info I do hold a couple other growth and dividend mutual funds in a different tfsa as well as in an rrsp, none are very substantial. I dream of all of this becoming substantial enough to afford me a semi early retirement, though it's looking fairly bleak lol.","Damn that's sad... You could've just put that money in a HYSA and made a lot more instead of trying to pick stocks. My advice is to sell all that shit and put it into either VOO, VT, VTI, or anything else but stop trying to stock pick, especially with how little money you have in the market cause clearly it's not working for you.",0,0.53,NEGATIVE,1.0

This is why everyday folks should stop stock picking and just stick to etfs.,0,0.543,NEGATIVE,0.848

They look ugly and on wealth simple you can only trade partials at market value which can be slow and Cumbersome. Use the cash from selling partial shares and put it into some shares you are confident in, an etf, or just YOLO it into an option trade.",0,0.525,NEGATIVE,1.0
