,,"Many investors were wanting the delusional hyper growth trend to continue.It beat, but not dramatically like it has come to be known for.The outlook was more about the hurdles they face, especially around powering it all, as much as it was about the innovation.We'll likely see the rest of tech continue to spend big on NVDA chips, but not at the same breakneck pace they have been.A correction in the stock would be healthy given this is all the case.",1,0.529,NEGATIVE,0.994

,,"Straight up hopium.I really don't think gap down reversal into major green type deals on earnings happen all that often (at least, they don't for me, I can only remember one instance).At this point, your only real two hopes are that: a: it reverses to down 2-3% and b: the NDX and potentially the market don't get completely broken tomorrow off semiconductors getting hammered.",3,0.525,NEGATIVE,0.574

,,"AI juggernaut Nvidia (NVDA) reported its second quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, beating expectations on the top and bottom line, and beating on anticipated guidance for the coming quarter.For the quarter, the company reported earnings per share of $0.68 on revenue of $30 billion. Analysts were expecting EPS of $0.64 and revenue of $28.8 billion. That's a massive increase from the same period last year when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.27 and revenue of $13.5 billion.The company also provided third quarter revenue guidance of $32.5 billion plus or minus 2%, analysts were looking for $31.9 billion.In a statement, CEO Jensen Huang said anticipation for the company's next-generation Blackwell chip is ""incredible.""Read more: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-slips-after-earnings-forecasts-top-estimates-amid-incredible-demand-for-its-next-gen-chip-202457442.html",0,0.608,NEGATIVE,0.994
,,50 Billion stock buyback is a great sign. ,0,0.602,POSITIVE,0.97
,,No itâ€™s not. Itâ€™s a really dumb allocation of money at those valuations. A lot of companies have fucked up buying back shares at high valuations trying to pump the stock even more.Keep in mind their market cap is 3T. So 50B buyback is 1.6% of the shares outstanding.,1,0.534,NEGATIVE,1.0

,,"Thanks chatGPT, but my point was that they will only reduce their share count by 1.6% at the current valuations. So i still think itâ€™s a bad allocation of capital unless they seriously donâ€™t have anything else to invest in, which i find hard to believe",3,0.518,NEGATIVE,1.0

,,"You got it backwards, AI models rely on GPU's to train and NVDA makes the most efficient and powerful GPU's. You can think of GPU's as a worker and training an AI model required thousands of workers.For example, ChatGpt trained GPT-4 in 100 days using 25000 A100 NVDA GPU's. Each A100 GPU cost 10k+. (it's like if you hired 25000 people to mow the the lawn of a whole football field).NVDA sells the shovels in a gold rush.",1,0.517,POSITIVE,0.997
