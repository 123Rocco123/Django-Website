,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I only hold MAG7/market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions. I use IBKR TWS for my platform and charts, please stop asking what I use. Some stocks I post may be <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific questions. Questions like “Thoughts on _____?” or “Is ___ a good investment?” will be ignored or I’ll troll you unless you add detail and your own opinion. I will block you if you are a troll. Especially today, remember that my positions are not recommendations to buy/sell a stock- I am just following subreddit rules to disclose positions News: Nvidia’s Earnings Will Test the S&P 500’s $4 Trillion Recovery NVDA - Earnings today. Currently long. Consensus EPS is $.64, but of course, future outlook will decide the move. This will pretty much decide the direction of the market for the next few days because we traded close to flat for the past week. AMBA - Released earnings, EPS of -.13 vs -.19, revenue of 63.7M vs 62.1M. Ultimately cites record revenue due to edge AI inference products and anticipating double-digit sequential growth for total revenue in the third quarter. S - Revenue met expectations, $198.9M vs $197.4M. EPS was 0.01 vs -0.01. Raises annual revenue forecast, guidance met expectations. SMCI - Still watching after the Hindenburg Research report yesterday. CRWD - Earnings today. Worth watching AFTER NVDA reports mainly because this is their post-outage earnings report. Currently long Earnings: NVDA, CRWD, CRM, AFRM, OKTA",Negative,0,0.47,NEGATIVE,0.999
