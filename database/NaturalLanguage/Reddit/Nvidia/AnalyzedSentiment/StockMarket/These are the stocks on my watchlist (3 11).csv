,"No positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers) To clarify since I've been asked: I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel: they're just my perspective of where a stock could potentially go. Percentages signify what the stock is trading at when I write up the report and are NOT predictions of stock price EOD. Many stocks I post are <$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade. Internet is insanely slow for reasons I can't discern, so no stock charts today and my thoughts will be short because I can't even log into my trading platform. All charts will sadly be from Google :( News: Reddit Launches Long-Awaited IPO With $748 Million Target NVDA- Looks like the $1000 level was never broken, and sold off pretty strongly on Friday. SMCI- Experienced an analyst downgrade, also pretty overextended. COIN- At all time highs in the market that contains ""the-coin-that-must-not-be-named"", pushing all the other names higher. Others to watch are BITO/GBTC/Miners/MARA, etc. BALY- Target of a takeover attempt, $15 a share from major shareholder in the company (~23%).
