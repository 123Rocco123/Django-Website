,"NVIDIA, often considered the heart of AI stocks, has recently been in the spotlight as analysts uniformly raise their stock targets. To me, this trend seems somewhat peculiar, even considering the current earnings season. The buoyant optimism surrounding the stock’s potential rise is sparking doubt in my mind. Should the stock underperform, it will be a litmus test of these analysts’ sincerity, raising questions about whether they may be manipulating public sentiment. In the broader context of the semiconductor sector, the recent quarterly earnings have been largely underwhelming. Yet, all semiconductor stocks appear to be buoyed by NVIDIA’s momentum. A stumble in NVIDIA’s stock could trigger a broader tech market downfall, while success could reignite a bullish trend for tech stocks. My intuition, however, leans towards a potential disappointment. NVIDIA might surpass current estimates but simultaneously lower their future guidance due to sluggish growth. Should this occur, a significant drop in stock price could follow.

They are not in a monopolistic market, and do not have absolute pricing power. Not only that, these chips do not get replaced yearly, they are a once in a 5 year investment, likely made by a cloud provider who will offer them on spot basis for maximum efficiency.People in the industry are not going to drop millions on chips when they can rent them from a cloud provider for the 5 minutes a week they need them and pay $10.I guess as long as you know that this is a technology that isn’t owned by Nvidia, you know that a) they likely aren’t going to make as much money from this as you think, and b) are actually likely to get overtaken by the likes of AMD or some SoC cloud offering.",2,0.542,0.949,POSITIVE
