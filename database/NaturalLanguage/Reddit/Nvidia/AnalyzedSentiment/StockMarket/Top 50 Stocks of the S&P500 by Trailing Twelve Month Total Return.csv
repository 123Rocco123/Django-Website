,"I built a tool that takes a list of equities and then uses the Alpha Vantage API to gather some equity data. I then use that data to calculate total returns. I like to share my data. Below is the top 50 stocks of the S&P500 sorted by Twelve Month Total Return. Top 50 Stocks of the S&P500 Of course, NVidia is at the top of the list. AMD and MU also make appearances in the top 15. The lowest P/E on the list is Celanese at 9.55. The highest P/E is AMD at 347.1. NVidia is the largest Market Cap at 2.26T. The lowest Market Cap is Assurant (AIZ) at 9.7B. As a momentum strategy, I have bought an equal share of all 50 stocks in my retirement account. (I only used about 10% of my account). I'll then rerun my report in a month and adjust. To adjust, I'll sell the stocks that fell of the top 50 and use the proceeds to buy their replacements, again equal share of proceedings to each. I plan to rebalance annually.",Doesn’t this just mean you are always buying things at their potential peak? Or at least always going after what’s hot / doing best? Past performance not inductive of future and all that. Not saying it’s a bad idea. Just seems like a “hype trap” - somewhat,0,0.513,NEGATIVE,1.0

I just worry it’s not a repeatable pattern. Would be curious to know what percentage of the top 50 in one year repeat into the next year at any given time. Put it this way - if you asked me, what 50 stocks do I think are most poised for solid growth over the next 12 months, I wouldn’t pick the 50 that just grew the most.",2,0.582,NEGATIVE,1.0
