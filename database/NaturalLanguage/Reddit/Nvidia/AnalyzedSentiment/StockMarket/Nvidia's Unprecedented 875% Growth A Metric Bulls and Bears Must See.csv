,"Whether you‚Äôre bullish or bearish on Nvidia, there‚Äôs one metric you need to consider before making your next move. Historical data since 1990 shows no current S&P 500 company has achieved what Nvidia just did: growing its Last Twelve Months (LTM) Net Income from $4 billion to $42.6 billion in just six quarters. The closest comparison is Ford‚Äôs growth from $4.5 billion to $23.1 billion over the same 6-quarters duration from 1996 to 1998. Nvidia‚Äôs (CQGR) over the past six quarters stands at an astounding 57.70%, translating to a total growth rate of 875.23%. 57.70% is quarterly rate, not the more common (CAGR). While some might label this explosive growth as a market top or even fraudulent, others see it as the dawn of an extraordinary growth phase that could continue indefinitely. Whatever your stance, keep in mind that Nvidia‚Äôs recent performance represents a once-in-a-century phenomenon.","This won‚Äôt continue indefinitely, and also can‚Äôt‚Ä¶that money is mostly coming from a fairly limited group of companies and entities, and their resources although massive are not infinite.It‚Äôs also true that any company with profits and growth like this will have competition coming for it‚Ä¶.they have a massive moat right now but time and investment will erode it.That doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôll slide tomorrow, but it‚Äôs a market certainty that their moat, growth and margins will not last forever‚Ä¶my limited understanding tells me they are priced to perfection, and the cash they are earning is someone else‚Äôs AI cash burn‚Ä¶at what point will investors in other companies begin to ask where the return is for all the capital being invested? I think Alphabet investors are beginning to ask that question, and quite rightly.",0,0.548,1.0,NEGATIVE

The challenging aspect is always the timing, not if.Another difficulty lies in the fact that these companies are not only limited in number (around ten or so) but are also extremely wealthy, with substantial cash reserves and unlevered cash flows, which they have nothing to do with the cash but just doing buybacks and dividends.Additionally, it‚Äôs worth considering whether their current stock prices are overvalued for buybacks or if the potential future opportunities in AI are overestimated.",1,0.533,0.989,POSITIVE

With the cash they have, they do have the ability to tool up to do this and stop paying the crazy margins to Nvidia that are obviously unsupportable.It is also interesting to speculate on what nvidia will need to do as the cash spend from these huge AI investors reduces, and/or other companies when to do what they do too. One perhaps obvious answer is nvidia gets in to the business of using their own chips to provide services related to AI by doing AI themselves, which would only accelerate the move by their customers to start their own design capabilities.These two things seem somewhat inevitable‚Ä¶.using the old gold miners/sell picks and shovels analogy: nvidias picks and shovels are hugely marked up, and the miners are starting to think about making their own picks and shovels, and nvidia is starting to think about maybe using some of their picks and shovels to do some gold mining of their own because ultimately the biggest pool of money is in the gold and right now they have the best picks and shovels.(None of this means nvidia is going to pop tomorrow or even this year‚Ä¶.right now just on momentum alone, and their moat, there‚Äôs a good argument to back them while the other scenarios will all taken some time to play out)",2,0.537,0.915,POSITIVE

The potential issue is chips take much longer to be designed or redesigned. Also, all (90%?) chips must be made by TSMC in Taiwan üáπüáº, and Jensen has strong relationships and influence in Taiwan. So that will be a wild card. We will see.",3,0.526,0.957,NEGATIVE
