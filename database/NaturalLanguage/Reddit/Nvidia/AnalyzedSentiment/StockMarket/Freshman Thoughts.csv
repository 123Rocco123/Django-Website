,"Got into stocks a couple months ago. Knew how they work for many years but saw it as gambling hehe, but here we are. A shaky start, freaked out, sold at a loss of 1300 some weeks ago, now riding the waves with more zen than before. Wanted some feedback from fellow comrades on this portfolio so far. Goal is to take diversified risk with a sprinkle of long term securities. Plan to withdraw some XEQT as funds are used for family vacations, rather keep them in that than an idle savings account. For other stocks, hoping they rocket over the next few years, and that looming monstrosity of WW3 doesn't kill this investment. Threw some dollars in SERV at a peak, holding to not realize that cost, but would rather have it in NVDA or WULF or something else. New to this stuff and posting on Reddit, so constructive advice welcome! Too broke to post on wallstreetbets just yet but still a regard! :)","Are you trying to create your own mutual fund? If so, what is the theme?When I first started investing, 45 years ago, I used a platform that allowed you to send in $25, $50, $100 at a time. At that time those platforms were rare. But I didn't buy 3 shares of this and 7 shares of that. I kept investing in one stock until I had $5k invested, only then did I buy shares in a 2nd stock.I do the same thing today. I have almost 7 figures invested and only own 24 stocks. If I wanted a mutual fund, I would have bought one, not made my own. I don't have time or the interest to look up each one of your picks, I only recognized a couple of them. If you believe in any of them, my advice would be to load up on it, not as you said, ""throw"" money at a wall full of them.Just my opinion, you have to do you.",0,0.557,NEGATIVE,1.0

I think I will go this route as you indicated, to load in a few stocks before spreading out so much. That will require deeper DD to see where intuition leads, and what I perceive profitable, which I'll be doing henceforth. Deeply appreciate the feedback! üôèüèº",1,0.511,POSITIVE,0.993

Stock picking returns really aren't noticeable until you have at least like 10k spread around 10 or less stocks imo.",0,0.537,NEGATIVE,1.0

If you can explain why you're in the positions you're in and why you'd keep contributing to them, then it makes sense why you'd be in those positions.If you can't and you're just in it 'cause ""AI, they go up"" then maybe stick to ETFs and ride it out, time is on your side. I'd be piling more into XEQT. Owning 1 share of something just doesn't make sense, especially SOXL when you're already in multiple semiconductor/AI stocks where you already have overlap with XEQT. That's also not really diversified risk. If you're going on vacations and need the cash, pull it from individual stocks that are crushin' it as you'll likely have more downside protection through an ETF. Basically, let the ETF cook long term.It's extremely easy to invest your money emotionally when you're on reddit looking at this stuff. You're in a good spot as a youngin', but don't overthink it. Personally, I think this is too many tickers for this amount of money, but this is not financial advice.",0,0.527,NEGATIVE,1.0

I'll be solidifying my strategy with such input so I really appreciate the insight!Hope to keep posting and sharing progress!",1,0.537,POSITIVE,0.999

It‚Äôs as deep as you want it to be. Youre young and enjoying life, I‚Äôd be cruising some ETFs or just piling it all into XEQT. A bunch of tiny positions is fun but it‚Äôs not likely going to do much for you because it‚Äôs harder to follow. With individual stocks I think it‚Äôs crucial to buy what you know.My best return is Costco. I worked at Costco, I understand it, I know where it‚Äôs going and it‚Äôs got an insane proven track record. I talk to friends about Costco and what they like/dislike about it. It‚Äôs hard to do that for 10+ positions.",2,0.516,POSITIVE,0.967
