To diversify further, consider adding exposure to sectors like consumer goods, technology beyond NVDA, energy, and financials. This can help spread out risk and give you a broader base. Also, incorporating a mix of small-cap, mid-cap, and large-cap stocks can provide a better balance between growth potential and stability.Ensure your portfolio reflects your goals, whether that’s wealth growth or income generation. You’re off to a great start for someone who began investing in January—keep up the good work!",0,0.531,POSITIVE,0.967

For example NVDA is already ~6% of SP500 so you have a very concentrated position there.Maybe you really know the ins and outs of NVDA, follow their earnings, understand what they do and where they’re going. If that’s the case go for it. If your thesis is more along the lines of you saw number go up a lot, and for that reason it must go up more - look to close that position at some point. I’d recommend that mindset for any individual name you own.Otherwise hold S&P, some TSX if you like, and close the charts you’ll outperform most.",0,0.511,POSITIVE,0.71

While there are exceptions (eg major integrated oil companies), many commodity related firms are feast or famine and not conducive to compounding wealth over time.I happen to think gold, if implemented properly, is a timely play right now due to it's historical performance during fed easing cycles, credit events, and general economic uncertainty. That said, it's an asset class that tends to work under very specific circumstances and to give back returns fairly quickly when circumstances shift.My suggestion is that you think about/investigate how holding a leveraged play on gold has panned out through fed easing cycles and whether or not you want the full ride. Keep in mind that prior period performance is informative but never a fully accurate road map, and that each company has it's own idiosyncratic factors pushing up or down on results and share prices.",0,0.531,NEGATIVE,0.98
