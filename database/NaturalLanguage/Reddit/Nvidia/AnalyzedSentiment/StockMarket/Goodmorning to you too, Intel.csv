Haven‚Äôt done any research or looked since my last dip but I just bought in for more Intel @ 20.70,"Couldn't say beyond I think Intel is too big of a company to fail completely. With the importance of microprocessors, there is a strong national prestige and security interest to keep Intel and the other large chip makers afloat. Still could leave you with no value in your stocks at the end of the day. In the end, I think any investment in an individual company is a gamble, one that should only be made if you are confident in the company's mission, vision, and/or performance. That is why over 90% of my market investments are in index funds.",2,0.583,NEGATIVE,0.997

While I do see that it could possibly be one of those companies that lose 9/10 value over the years due to lack of expansion and growth, but aren‚Äôt they currently building a super building for their microprocessors?

,Anybody got any idea on the big dip? Haven‚Äôt done any research or looked since my last dip but I just bought in for more Intel @ 20.70,"The exact scale is unknown and Intel will never be honest about it, but AT LEAST all K series 13th and 14th gen processors have a manufacturing defect causing instability and crashes. Initially, it was thought to be a microcode issue and/or motherboard manufacturers screwing up bios settings. Those are still factors, but now it is clear there is also a huge manufacturing defect and all 3 issues are causing permanent damage to chips. Intel has still not released a micro code update to fix that part and honestly who knows when/if motherboard manufacturers will do anything. The manufacturing defect is unfixable and all those chips are basically trash if you need good stability.A huge number of 13th and 14th gen processors need to be recalled. And if Intel had any integrity they would have already. Some server and game streaming/hosting companies have stated they are seeing more than 50% failure rate. Which for servers in particular, that is completely unacceptable.So Intel has a huge liability of 100s of thousands of processors out there right now and has no stated intentions to replace them. That means there will be litigation, and server customers and consumers will be looking elsewhere for processors in the future. This is about the most brand damaging thing they could have done.",2,0.517,NEGATIVE,1.0
