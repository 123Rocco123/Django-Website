,,Tsla rallied 60% post split nvda also rallied post split in 2021. No one knows what will happen pre split or post split or if there will even be another split. History doesn’t always repeat itself either.,2,0.52,0.619,NEGATIVE

,,"Splits are meaningless, except that they tend to lure in more retail buyers and inflate the stock price temporarily.QCOM split 4:1 in November 1999. We know what happened next.Of course, that was after a 4-year bubble was inflated. We're not even close to that. NVDA today is down over 100 points from its high, wiping out a whole two days worth of gains. Carnage!! ;)",1,0.548,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,I mean technically if your shares turned to 100 shares you could start selling covered calls that you weren't able to before.,2,0.516,0.996,NEGATIVE
,,I read up on the QCOM split and the adjustments made afterwards. I know a bit about option trading..maybe this may be a good time to execute call options?,2,0.525,0.973,NEGATIVE
,,"IMO it’s wait and see. Today was an ugly candle, often indicative of an intermediate top. Whether or not the sellers can gain control remains to be seen.If we do have a pullback, IV will increase and selling premium may become attractive. If NVDA were to drop back to the 600 area by some miracle, I’d write as many 500 PUTs as I could afford.",3,0.525,1.0,NEGATIVE

,,"Nobody seemed to explain it to you so I will. Like the other guy said, a split technically means nothing, as share price alone isn't important in deciding whether something is a good investment or not.Essentially, if there are a thousand total shares, each valued at $100, then the company is worth $100,000. If there is a stock split, say a 5 to 1 split, then there are now 5 thousand total shares, each valued at $20. But the market cap is still $100,000. The only thing that a split does that theoretically could affect the value of the stock is making the minimum buy-in to invest in the company lower. Someone who wants to invest in Nvidia but doesn't have almost $1000 to buy a single share might be more willing to buy one or two at $200, even if they're really only getting one or two fifths of the actual value of that $1000 share.However, in reality, that doesn't actually affect anything, as the number of shares bought by people like that is so mind-bogglingly small compared to the trading done by institutional investors that it would do nothing.",1,0.561,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,You hit the main argument. The minimum buy-in is now smaller. That’s it.,2,0.535,0.8,POSITIVE
,,It will make it so more people can trade options around the stock . More retail investors will be more willing to buy in as well,1,0.582,0.52,NEGATIVE

,,Why would the price be dropping if the shares are just splitting. If 1 share becomes 4 and the share becomes 4 times less valuable then its still the same price. I don't get why the sudden drop of like 100$ today...,0,0.54,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"Price isn't dropping off of a potential split, it's dropping because nvidia currently has a P/E of 77 and people are taking profits.",1,0.521,0.677,NEGATIVE

,,Some arguments I have heard is that Nvidia is funding their own customers. And that they reported future sales as income for which they have contracts for.

,,"Help me understand, I have 50 shares of Nvidia which I bought before they even hit $200. If the stocks split, don’t I still retain the same stake in Nvidia?My 50 shares could split by 4 into 200 but that still should be worth the same (rounding using todays price 44.6k USD)?Are people just looking to get into Nvidia now because the prices are cheaper? I would expect that to lead to a temporary boost as retail investors flock in but increased volatility from folks (like me) who will cash out and institutional investors making moves.Whats the opportunity here?",0,0.534,0.981,NEGATIVE
,,Some people don’t even enter looking at these prices. 1:4 split gives them the opportunity and most people tend to hold longer making the stock a little tiny bit more valuable. It’s just a very small permanent boost with the influx of new investors/buyers.,1,0.533,0.998,POSITIVE
,,"When a stock splits, the number of shares you hold automatically increases, while the value per share decreases. The total value of your holdings will not change, it is just simple 2:1 or 4:1 division. The main change for you is that the purchase price will appear to change with the split, so you think of it as buying before $200, but after the split the appearance will be you bought at a lower price, based on the division.The TLDR version is that you bought at a very good price and you can just keep holding. If there is a split, all the calculations will be done automatically by your broker and the total value of your investment won't change.",1,0.538,0.98,NEGATIVE
