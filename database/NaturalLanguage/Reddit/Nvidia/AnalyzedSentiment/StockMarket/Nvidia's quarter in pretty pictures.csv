,,These numbers are absolute bonkers. Never seen anything like it before and I’ve been doing this a long time.I’m not sure how Nvidia can transition to recurring sales once the upgrade cycle ends. That will be the key for this company to continue growing.,0,0.577,NEGATIVE,0.797
,,"Haha ya, same here. I honestly don’t think another company in history has grown revs by that dollar amount in a single year before.I mean, Pfizer went from $42b to $81b between 2020 and 2021 from COVID vax but those aren’t exactly recurring at that level. Curious if any other company has done anything close to this before.And ya, they have a choke hold on GPU space for the foreseeable future but with such a big prize at stake, I do have concerns about what the long term picture looks like.",1,0.556,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,I think Apple may have had similar trajectory after iPhone launch.,2,0.522,NEGATIVE,0.998
,,I don't see nvda having staying power like aapl.,3,0.504,NEGATIVE,0.997
,,"Nobody knows the future buddy. In the option market you can probably sell strike 1500 leap calls right now for a nice premium.But after Sam Altman said he needs $7 Trillion for AI chips I was like ok, maybe Nvidia will be worth $7 trillion in 5 years when AI is doing all the work.",4,0.568,POSITIVE,0.503
,,Can you really rely on what Altman says tho?,5,0.524,POSITIVE,0.981
,,"Why not?We all know AI/Robotics is like $100 trillion market since it's goal is to reduce human labor cost. So $7trillion is a fair value when you are talking about that big of a market.Keep in mind though, I am a skeptic who thinks that there is a 50% chance all these may not even yield a great product, good enough to replace most white collar workers.Maybe they will recoup the cost by selling productivity improvement products.",6,0.54,NEGATIVE,0.999
,,"You couldn't be more wrong. The AI revolution has just started, and it is going to remap how we function as a society. This reminds me of when internet first came out. The difference is Nvidia is a well established company, has the market cornered and is buying up or investing in most relevant AI initiatives. Nvidia is on a coarse to be and remain the gate keeper for AI for a very long time.",4,0.583,POSITIVE,0.974
,,"I mean I'm not against its. But how aapl bleeds money from society, I don't see it yet with nvda in the same way. But I'm not against you.",5,0.584,NEGATIVE,0.988
,,AI and encryption. Around covid time there were programs like Folding At Home that used volunteers who could lend their GPU power to simulations of protein folding. I participated because even if they didn't find something for covid there were possibilities of having breakthrough with other diseases.,1,0.519,POSITIVE,0.993

,,Never seen anything like it before and I’ve been doing this a long time.I think Apple may have had similar trajectory after iPhone launch.,1,0.528,POSITIVE,0.986
,,Nope. I know because I backed up the truck when the first iPhone released ($5 a share). It got cut in half the next year due to GFC. I felt pretty stupid but held on.,2,0.543,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,"Imagine what will happen to Nvidia if we get another GFC. Nobody can survive that.But if you remove 2008, Apple went from something like 15-20 billion company straight to 500 billion in few years. But then the real price appreciation came after 2017.",3,0.562,NEGATIVE,0.838
,,"Trust me. I was 50/50 on selling Apple when it dropped 50% the next year. It sounds easy but it is not. There is this constant stream of negativity, doom and gloom everywhere.GFC type crash will happen again. Will it be this year? 10 years? 50 years? 100 years? Nobody knows. You just have to be able to stomach it when it does happen and trust that your investment will recover over time.",4,0.559,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,"Without FED/Govt bailout back then our we would have had a depression similar to 1930s with unemployment going to 25%.I was scared shitless selling strike 30 puts of apple back then, it was crazy because apple had $30/share in cash, fear was what if companies lost their cash due to it being with the banks since all banks were on the verge of collapse due to counterparty risk.",5,0.512,NEGATIVE,0.998
,,"You just have to be able to stomach it when it does happen and trust that your investment will recover over time.Yup, this is what I do. I've tried to predict the stock market, and it never works out for me; so when I like a company I just buy it and hold it, maybe take some profits here and there if I'm overly concentrated in a sector.",5,0.59,POSITIVE,0.996
,,I think our approach should be to make enough money off it now to let someone else worry about that lol,1,0.509,NEGATIVE,0.981
,,"I have no idea why anyone would be bearish on this company.Yeah their valuation is bit rich and priced for perfection but imagine if they have their own AI, they will make a ton of money from there and other companies will have a hard time competing since pretty much it's their own chips.Not to mention with all these money going into R&D, it's quite possible no other chip company may be able to catch up with them.Sam Altman wanting to start a chip company with $7 trillion is an indication that he does not like Nvidia's monopoly on the top quality chips. That's a big positive to own Nvidia.That said, I have no positions in any individual stocks, I only use ETFs.",0,0.584,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,"Dude, I am just making the case that shorting this stock can cost someone a lot.I do not own this stock and would not be buying this stock at this price but I am not going to take the risk of shorting this stock when there is a possibility of big upside if they invent their own AI.",1,0.599,NEGATIVE,1.0

,,Market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.That's very true w.r.t shorting.But on the long side you can hold the fucking bag as long as you want. You just need to visit the AMC or GME subs. I am guessing the BBBY sub maybe dead since that stock went to zero.,3,0.532,NEGATIVE,0.999

,,"Did you believe in this company if not hopefully your current investments are doing ok.BTW, there was a guy back in back in Oct 2022 when everything was down, he was on the verge of Bankruptcy since he had doubled down on NVDA stock on margin.If he did not bail out due to margin call he maybe worth $2 million today.If he bailed out he will be broke and owe his relatives $200k or something. It's just crazy.",4,0.559,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,"I bought in during the covid slump. I bought shares averaging around $218 and I thought about panic selling when it went down to the $120's, but I just told myself to chill and stayed in.",4,0.511,POSITIVE,0.991

,,It’ll be $1k tomorrow,0,0.498,NEGATIVE,0.993
,,"WTF makes you think that? I say that because...I sold ~500 shares at 725 Tuesday, then picked them back up at about 680(so not quite at the top or near the bottom)...but I was going to sell again at 820 and just decided to not risk it as I'm not savvy enough to be doing this(My buddy at MS just said he thought Nvidia would dip before the earnings call, but he said he liked them long term, so I trusted him as I've not acted on his advice so many other times).But you think it's going to skyrocket THAT much more or were you being facetious?",1,0.569,NEGATIVE,1.0

,,It'll go to 1k before it goes below 700 again. Everyone wants nvda.,2,0.507,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,"Well...yeah, I didn't say I thought it'd hit 700, I was just curious WHY he thought it'd take a huge jump.I'm realizing this is a pretty sarcastic site...and you get downvoted when you do...stupid things(like try and time when Nvidia is going to go up or down a few bucks).That's alright. Stupid should get downvoted.",3,0.53,NEGATIVE,1.0
