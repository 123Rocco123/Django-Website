,,Yup Germany has a GDP of 4 trillion and Microsoft has a revenue of 212 billion. That comparison would make a little more sense but isnâ€™t sensational,1,0.519,NEGATIVE,0.985

,,"Thank you. OP is a fool.Productivity / time Vs Perceived value of company based on future returns / indefinite period of time.A false comparison between two big numbers. A quant would know better than to regurgitate this trite nonsense.OPs comparison of GDP and market cap is mindless. I assume that OP is saying that the population of Germany, Japan, India, and the UK are lazy, inefficient and unproductive when measured against the yardstick of mega-cap corporations future value? /sI will argue that the perceived value of mega cap firms based on future returns may be overvalued compared to not-so mega cap. Some may argue they are undervalued because tech has enabled and thus may continue to offer improvements in human efficiency, which other industries may be willing to pay for in the future. That is a valid topic for exploration and debate about imbalance.But comparing two big, unrelated numbers which have a currency symbol at the start and different denominators displays nothing.StatQuants brought a stat, but is not a quant, but a fool.",3,0.531,NEGATIVE,1.0

,,"Not saying it reduces the sad state of my country much but a dollar goes a long way in India even after converting. Purchasing power basically. So it would feel more like a 9-15 trillion dollar economy depending on what youâ€™re buying.Again, doesnâ€™t make it any less horrible. Add to that inequality that would make America seem like Norway and you have a thoroughly unforgiving place for the masses.",1,0.512,NEGATIVE,0.963
