Maybe a fearful novice avoids a loss by not investing, but they might also lose money by not investing, if the market rips while they're uninvested. It feels more real to see the red number than it is to have a ""theoretical"" loss of missing a market rise, but they're somewhat equivalent in the end. If you know you have money you don't need for a decade, it is a mistake to not put that money in the stock market, just as much as taking that money out when the market crashes.

They just shut down a major Star Wars attraction which should have been a golden goose.They just strangled two beloved franchises, Star Wars and Indiana Jones, to death. The MCU is on life support. They’ve had historic flops this year, with The Little Mermaid barely breaking even. If you gave me that headline 10 years ago I’d have called you insane. The scope of their creativity now appears to be remaking old IP for “modern audiences.” People are sick of Disney’s bland, generic, (bad) CGI-laden content.D+ just lost four million subscribers. For a growth product, that’s a catastrophe. It’s also losing billions. So now they’re cutting lots of content too. It’s managed for failure. Unfortunately a lot of Disney’s market cap was based on D+ success.They’re going to sell down their existing TV assets, which are currently quite profitable, further straining their cash flows and calling into question their entire strategy or lack thereof.They started a war with the governor of Florida for apparently no reason at all. Now they’re losing all kinds of privileges, and DeSantis has indicated much more to come because he has hitched his political ambitions on bringing Disney to heel.Because of Disney’s culture war, they’ve sparked an informal conservative boycott. Major conservative personalities like Tucker Carlson and Ben Shapiro are telling their listeners to stop patronising Disney. Conservatives comprise roughly half of the U.S. and the vast majority of the planet.The writer’s strike is just icing. For the first time in decades, actors are striking with writers, and are dug in. The major losers here are studios, and the longer this continues, the more this compounds Disney’s above described issues.",2,0.517,NEGATIVE,1.0

Instead, they’ve repeatedly stated, publicly, that they intend to continue injecting modern progressive American themes into their content. That’s extremely partisan, and the opposite of appealing to the entire country. It’s even less well received internationally, and their declining Chinese revenue is evidence of this.For the record, Disney lobbed the first grenade. March 11, 2022: Disney employees pressure the company to take a stand against the proposed Parental Rights in Education legislation. CEO Bob Chapek sends a message to all employees “especially our LGBTQ+ community,” and says he’s sorry the company didn’t act sooner and announces that Disney is pausing all political contributions in the state of Florida.",4,0.527,NEGATIVE,1.0

It’s why people preach to do your own research but the problem is most aren’t smart enough to know if their research means anything and then of course research is out the window with some stocks that seems to move up and down seemingly without any catalyst. For an example I just watched two YouTube videos last night. One giving their view on why Palantir will continue to go up and then another one from someone explaining why it’s garbage. Who’s right? Who knows?Which brings us back to why people say to invest in an index and be done with it which is where I am. I only pick a few individual stocks in a play money account I have. My other larger accounts are buying VOO/VGT at about a 70/30 split simply because I love tech and want more exposure there.,2,0.516,NEGATIVE,1.0

Studies show that retail investors almost always underperform the underlying strategy they've chosen because they try to time things. So if VOO makes 10%, the typical retail investor who invests in VOO might make only 5% because they try to time things.Now, that underperformance tends to be from buying more when the prices are high and less when the prices are low, which is the opposite of what you're thinking. The problem is that no one knows the future, and today's ""high prices"" may end up looking low in retrospect.If you're buying individual stocks then you need to pay much more attention to valuation and timing because single stocks are much more variable.
