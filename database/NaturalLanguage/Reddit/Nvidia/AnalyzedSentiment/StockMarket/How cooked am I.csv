,"Hi! Got into investing and did some research. My mom gave me 1000 euros to invest and i put 200 of my own, so total 1200 euros. I told her i would put it into etf-s but did this. Maybe got a little greedy, pretty new to this and afraid to lose but at the same time FOMO. How cooked am I? Any advice would be appreciated!","Buy an sp500 index and stop trying to pick stocks. You will NEVER outperform the market, especially as a new investor.If BTC goes down 50% tomorrow, are you going to be able to hold or are you going to panic and sell to preserve what you have left?Quit while you're ahead, there's a correction coming from the last pump, plus people selling off for this year's gains. Buy an Sp500 index ETF and never look back. When you have fuck around money, then pick stocks. But considering this post is over 1200 EUR, you don't have fuck around money",0,0.559,NEGATIVE,1.0

It was on a downward trend and only saved when Trump was announced president-elect. The market is heavily speculating. It could go up, could go down, no one knows, there's no tangible underlying asset in crypto, it's a speculative investment. High volatility, high risk, possibly high reward.As for your justification of pltr, I don't own so I don't know their business. Joining the NASDAQ isn't a prerequisite for guaranteed growth. Lots of companies have come and failed.I would dump everything an put your funds into a low MER sp500 index like VOO.Once you do that, then set up a recurring deposit for an amount you can afford the buy a share or fractional share every week/month. You gotta be persistent for wealth.",2,0.541,NEGATIVE,1.0

Anyone and everyone can and do post with extreme confidence regardless of accuracy. Information from the traditional financial press (WSJ, FT Bloomberg) and research reports from established firms are done by professionals, have accurately described qualifications/track records, and are subject to editorial oversight and fact checking.   People with a stronger financial background can get good stuff out of social media as they know enough to spot most of the cons, scams, and fools.
