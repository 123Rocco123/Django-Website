With a decent amount of risk HURA is good It specializes in uranium products which Is projected to do very well over the next 30 years.Also VDY is good af.Very Canadian bank focused. But it also pays a pretty Dividend So if you were looking To get lots of financial exposure and a consistent dividend, VDY is a good option.XEQT It's also solid.

But it's heavily diversified internationally, so it provides a safety net.In the end, any of these work And if you aren't into investing, don't worry about any of the options I provided here just stick it into the S and P 500.I personally don't like the s and p. Because you're relying on growth. And there has been periods in history where that has not grown for 20 years.
