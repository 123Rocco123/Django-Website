,"Just looking for honest advice since none of my friends trade. I started off with about 12.5k from working restaurant jobs in high school. I've been trading for about 2 years but stayed mostly flat during that time, since the start of 2024 i've finally been moving positive. Honestly I have no idea if this is good or bad. I keep seeing people make 100k off nvidia lol.","That volatility suggests you’re trying to hard. Just buy an index fund and chill.Invest into something when you think you’ve found an edge that others don’t have. Hint: you will rarely find this. If you’re finding an edge every week, you don’t have an edge.",0,0.517,0.999,NEGATIVE

Well your gains effect your taxes not really the other way around. Taxes are based off your gains. If you are getting hefty taxes you likely have hefty gains. I also expect short and long term ideas to have different margins. As well as different amounts of capitol in everyone's portfolios.So the question is what are the gains on the security you are trading? I guess it comes down to what are your goals and strategy. Yes, beating the index is everyone's. But so is making money. Bag holding a position just to try and get out of say 10% maybe 20% in taxes is not a strategy I'd go for if I think the stock is going to drop quickly. So its all about current gains and goals.I'm curious. For short term ideas only. Does anyone actually say ""I am worried about this position but if I hold it for one more quarter I can drop my tax bracket?""",3,0.531,1.0,NEGATIVE

A comparison between two things, typically for the purpose of explanation or clarification. We are comparing short term to long term taxes my friend.Now we come back to my final question of my last comment. Does anyone hold on to a position for a extra 4 months or more to gain your extra +1.48% net? Is it worth the wait? Some of us like very high risk. Almost like the original comment u/Miko109 posted. ""Was it worth all the extra work for .80%?""So again in my second comment... It depends on your goals and strategies. I still don't like your analogy. Even if your math is correct. Its all about how you are trading and what your goals are. Everyone's goal is to beat the index obviously.Is bag holding to net a possible 1% extra a strat? Not for me. I'd rather exit the position and move on so I can grab another possible 10% somewhere. But I play very high risk normally.I feel there are two sides to this coin and we may end up talking in circles. Simply because we both play differently. But regardless, best of luck to you and your endeavors.",5,0.535,1.0,NEGATIVE
