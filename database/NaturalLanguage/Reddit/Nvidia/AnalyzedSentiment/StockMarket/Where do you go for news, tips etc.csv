,"Hello, I’m new to the stock, I just open an account with eToro and another with Robinhood ( I known what everyone thinks of them). I want to read more on stocks and learn, so I know where I’m putting my money. I’m looking at long term by the way. Every time I start reading an article I get cut off and asked to subscribe, If I do i I want something serious and honest, not sure if those are the right words, but I don’t want to be bombarded with nonsense like “dodge is back buy before is gone” crap So far I own a few shares of Nvidia, that’s what got me into it also Microsoft evolv tech, Cisco and ADVM. Thanks! Oh and any suggestions on what to invest in, if is not breaking the rules would be greatly appreciated.",ok,5,0.5,0.534,POSITIVE
