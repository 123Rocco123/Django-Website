,,"If you made a profit and it was beyond your risk tolerance, then that's how it is. If you're making good decisions overall, you'll make a few wrong calls, but in the long run, you'll be ahead.NVDA is a company that relies purely on a monopoly in an industry that other companies have capability in. It's 2/3 of the size of Microsoft but has far less products. So you should expect it to go up a lot, but also down a lot (as seen during 2022).",2,0.557,NEGATIVE,0.998

,,"fair, my point is they aren't riding a monopoly, they are the leader in the space, and have the best product of their space. their market share is as a RESULT of their innovation.

,,"Their point is nvidia is more sensitive to losing market share since their products aren‚Äôt as diversified. Not that I think they‚Äôll lose a significant amount anytime soon but I think their point is valid.Not all monopolies / market dominations are the same, especially in bleeding edge tech.",6,0.547,POSITIVE,0.668

,,"Well, they're the clear major supplier of discrete GPUs and AI chips. That satisfies the criteria of a monopoly.I think the moat is a different question where increased competition will become a problem, similar to how Tesla was ahead in EVs until competitors came along and forced them to cut prices. It might not happen this year, but eventually, it will, if AI proves to provide enough value to companies.",6,0.553,POSITIVE,0.995

,,"Last year it fell by a similar level after having a great run and there was a period of time where the stock did nothing before moving again after earnings. I think part of that was the fear of government shutdown last year but once the market got over its wall of worry the darlings like Nvidia went up. It already had a great run from November 2023 to March 2024 which is seasonally a stronger time for markets anyway. Now it makes sense for it to take a breather with such large gains behind it and a re-accelerating inflation story scaring the market and making it look for opportunities in other spaces. I largely think the disinflation trend is intact and it‚Äôll show more next year when the lag effects of shelter come in line. Sure, geopolitics and seasonality makes energy and rotation plays interesting but how long can that last? And even if energy is needed for AI infrastructure, why does it mean Nvda has to see the air come out of it?So my long term thesis for Nvda hasn‚Äôt changed, so long as demand outstrips supply for its business this thing is a buy. The only question I have is when‚Äôs a good entry point in the near term and when‚Äôs a good exit? If I hold my nose for a greater pullback, I‚Äôll probably miss the gains. That‚Äôs the hard part for me to read. This stock reminds me a lot of Netflix back in 2021, growing until competition looked good, consolidating until earnings and seasonality was in play. If my private equity friend is right, we‚Äôre nowhere close to demand coming in line with supply so I think we can still ride this one. Eventually, macro and geopolitics will have less a sway on sentiment and it‚Äôs all about the micro from earnings. I want to see what the mega cap tech earnings reports say though before I get more of this, that can give clues on the AI demand.",0,0.551,NEGATIVE,0.958
