,Trading on public.com. Half of portfolio is I'm nvidia/Microsoft. Just started investment plan for magnificent 7 and high dividend. What do the screenshots mean? Thanks!,"I mean the stock types, it says that 99% of my stocks are healthcare and unclassified which is very wrong.Also I truly just don't understand the stock stats and what they mean.",3,0.594,NEGATIVE,1.0
,Trading on public.com. Half of portfolio is I'm nvidia/Microsoft. Just started investment plan for magnificent 7 and high dividend. What do the screenshots mean? Thanks!,Yeah. From your screenshots I’m not seeing the 99% in healthcare of unclassified so I’m not sure what you mean.Also very interesting that you chose to invest into stocks without understanding these metrics. I highly recommend you start doing some research before the blind investing bites you in the butt. If you got good gains in 2023 congrats so did everyone else. If you don’t have a solid investment philosophy it’s similar to gambling and the house will eventually win.,4,0.518,POSITIVE,0.54
