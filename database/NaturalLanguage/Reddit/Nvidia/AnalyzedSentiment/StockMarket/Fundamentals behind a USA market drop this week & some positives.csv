,"The problem areas in the USA: -------------------------- *- The Schiller PE is at a very high level. Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble. So stocks are highly expensive. *- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022! We are more of a service economy than a goods economy, *- World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle. That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local sales declines are offset. Additionally the trade war hampers both sides. *- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels. *- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers. You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term. People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank. However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials. AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth. AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales. So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia. This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW. I don't own any MKSI. This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording. So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN. Good areas: -------------------------------------- *- Labor productivity is up consistently since Q3 2022. one can see tradingeconomics dot com USA productivity *- Gasoline is lower than last year *- Retail sales are going fine, [ per a recent NPR radio article ] Nuetral ---------------------------------------- *- Labor force participation is not higher than Sept 2023. No more sales growth from people returning to work. Participation is up recently. tradingeconomics has this info. *- Consumer confidence is still down since January 2020. My one man's take ---------------- The problem areas are serious. There is enough weight in the bear issues to cause the stock market to give up most of its gains this year.","Also, remember that NVIDIA is running a global business and is not only dependant on the US. I agree valuation is high, but then again, they’re growing internationally.",0,0.573,POSITIVE,0.997

Agree that even if you drain all the money in potential customers, they can't support current NVDA valuations.It is all hypes.
