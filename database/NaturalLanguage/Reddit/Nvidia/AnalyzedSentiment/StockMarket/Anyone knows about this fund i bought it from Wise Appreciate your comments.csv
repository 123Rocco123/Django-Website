,"I bought like 250$ iShares World Equity Index Fund (LU) It includes Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp, Amazon Com Inc, Nvidia Corp, Meta Platforms Inc Class A, Tesla Inc, Alphabet Inc Class A, United Health Group Inc and more but Apple has the biggest share in the fund. Fund manager is BlackRock and risk score is 6 out of 7 i guess this is high because all these companies are the biggest in the world so i thought it would be more safer but this risk score i don’t know. Appreciate your advice. I do not need this money in short-term tho but i am wondering is this fund aims to make profit in long term or mid term? (years) I may add usd to this fund monthly basis.",Stick to the QQQ’s if you want those companies. Easy as that,0,0.529,0.998,NEGATIVE
