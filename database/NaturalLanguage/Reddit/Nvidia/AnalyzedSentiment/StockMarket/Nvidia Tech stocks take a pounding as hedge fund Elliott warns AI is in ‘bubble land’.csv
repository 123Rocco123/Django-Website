So the big techs went down in rebalancing.Then people got scared of Powell and some economic slowdown data. So they sold their R2K and 400 as well as their tech.This is a 10% correction, we have one of those every 14 months on average.I was skeptical about ""AI"" til some people on CNBC started discussing the big techs' actual earnings. They really do make a fortune. They deserve to be expensive, moreso than the R2K or 400 or 90% of the S&P 500.As for ""AI"", it's a hype word meaning regression analysis and teaching computers to man call centres.

,,"Let me tell you a story. I was told to transform a stored procedure into excel. But I was also told that it would need to be done in a way where it could be understood by humans to be updated and to standardize fields as the same excel is replicated over 50 times and each excel and store proc (50 of them) have different requirements. ChatGPT was able to change the store proc into excel with little work. Ya!!! But the amount of time to train ai to reach the end product required would have taken thousands of training sessions and iterations to complete and also be objectively agreed upon by the various product owners and even executives. Think your shower thoughts where your brain randomly solves a complex problem that has stumped you and possibly an entire team or company. And boom, randomly as if out of nothing you come to work and say if we do this and connect that with that and take away that it solves this problem. Everyone goes ya and objectively agrees or even say ya and makes your solution even better.

,,It doesn‚Äôt merely come from that. I think the use of it is inhumane. Humans have a subjective reality. Think about literally every thought you have had. Like all of. If you are like me you have dreamed of wonder and terrible and ridiculous things. And they are your thoughts but some of your thoughts become an objective reality for those other humans around you. So now we have something that randomly creates subjective thoughts and we humans have to objectively believe them or we have to provide oversight and say nope that‚Äôs wrong. I think some people confuse automations which is the training of a system to do a repetitive task with ai. We have all sorts of automation but tweaking existing processes still requires a depth of understanding of how it works and how uses and the end goal. Also ai will eventually run out of data and thus it would be dependent on us to feed and train it more. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs not kinda neat but I am saying humans are able to create subjective thoughts more quickly and with less energy and some would argue an unlimited data set.,4,0.52,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,And lastly the human learning process is built with trail and error where we present our subjective reality to the world and sometimes it agrees (human and even science and our physical world) and sometimes it disagree and we fail. So it‚Äôs trail and error to learn and if ai just tells you the answer did you actually learn anything. Mastery is doing something for over 8 years and knowing everything about a discipline.
