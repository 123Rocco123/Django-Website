I'd suggest coming up with a 5/10 year plan and figure out what you want to buy and hold until retirement. Then stick with that plan and buy whenever the market dips.Personally, my goal is to buy/hold and reduce my average cost. I think that's better then worrying about my portfolio total balance or worry about the current stock price.",2,0.582,POSITIVE,0.592

ETF's are composed of stocks and you can buy ETF's that focus on certain sectors. KO is a slow grower, but they are a dividend king. I also own KO, not much, but will continue to buy it. VOO is an etf. Thats the Vanguard top 500 companies. Its a great ETF.You can buy ETF's that pay dividends like SCHD. Or you can buy VOO which focuses on growth.",6,0.549,POSITIVE,0.999
