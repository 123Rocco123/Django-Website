Sell cash secured puts on enough quality names up your $100k. Sell them monthly, as long as stock(s) doesn't get that low you collect and repeat. If the stock(s) drop then you get assigned the shares and were essentially paid money over time to buy them lower.Then repeat the process by selling 1 call of each 100 shares you have for every stock you own (covered calls). Keep doing this once every month. If stock price doesn't get high enough you pocket money and do it again. If stock prices hit the target you then have them sold away for a profit plus the premium you sold them for over time.Once shares are called away, start selling cash secured puts again, starting the process over.The 10-15 min a week is just to look everything over once a week to see whether you need to take any action.Lots of free content and free YouTube videos to show you how, you don't need to pay for a service.I run the wheel on my IRA, and sell options for additional account growth.Yes this is a bit more involved than buying SPY/VEU and holding.

But this I enjoyed writing it:1.Residential property is by far the best long term investment.2. Leveraged shares/stocks/ETFs etc risk a margin call which you donâ€™t want.3. Primarily: pick a property with high capital gains potential. The same location location location axiom still applies.4. Secondary: if youâ€™re not living in it, pick a suburb that has decent rent which will pay the most of your mortgage for you while you make an avg. 7% growth over a long term.5. As a rule of thumb, donâ€™t invest in property for the short term.6. Never sell, but as the value of property #1 grows, use the equity you now have to put a deposit down on property # 2.7. Short term? Bitcoin will explode in the next 12-18 months (DYOR but DM me if you want to know more about why. I wonâ€™t bore others here).8. Given that statistically, bitcoin will rise exponentially in the next 12-18 months, donâ€™t just buy a fraction of a bitcoin, youâ€™d be wasting too good an opportunity to leverage.9. Spend say $1-5k (you donâ€™t need to spend more if you say leverage x25, or whatever youâ€™re comfortable with) it through a broker like Pionex (Full disclosure, my fintech son put me on to leveraged bitcoin auto bots and it went very well and this/his link gave me extra USDT on my first trade, so Iâ€™d say it will give you the same reward as I got).10. After 18 months, cash in the leveraged bot (thatâ€™s been trading 24/7 while youâ€™re asleep and which IMHO will be at $260k by Xmas 2025) and use this profit and the equity in your property to buy property # 2.

I've alreadt few thousands invested in NVIDIA, GOOG etc. I would like to buy mainly some ETFs and maybe some single stock. As I want to do a 5 years investment I know I should not watch at the current price but if there's any suggestion about when and how to buy a ETF? I'm really curious about your suggestion. Feel also free to leave some of your research/ hidden gems.",You think theyâ€™re fronting wealth? Funny I never thought of it that way.,3,0.506,NEGATIVE,0.809
