,,"Look into ETFs instead of individual stocks. I allow myself a few individual stock plays, but the majority is in an ETF basket portfolio at certain percentages with ETFs which have low expense ratios and well diversified.This happens to be my core portfolio (I also max my ROTH and 401k matching yearly as well as trade options and contribute to crypto monthly):ROTHHere’s a breakdown of my Roth IRA portfolio, designed for broad exposure with growth potential and balanced risk. Each fund has a unique focus, providing a foundation for long-term growth with a measure of stability.Roth IRA Portfolio OverviewThis portfolio aims to capture growth in U.S. and international markets while maintaining a bond component to balance risk. This mix provides exposure to different regions and sectors, allowing for steady growth with downside protection.FSKAX (Fidelity Total Market Index Fund) – 60%What it is: FSKAX covers nearly the entire U.S. stock market, from large to small companies across all sectors.Why it's included: This fund offers broad exposure to the U.S. economy, providing long-term growth through diversification. By covering almost the entire market, FSKAX reduces reliance on any single sector or company.2. FSPSX (Fidelity International Index Fund) – 25%What it is: FSPSX invests in large and mid-cap stocks from developed markets outside the U.S., including Europe, Japan, and Canada.Why it's included: This fund adds international diversification, reducing risk associated with the U.S. market alone. Developed international markets bring stability, and they can provide opportunities when U.S. markets are volatile.3. FXNAX (Fidelity U.S. Bond Index Fund) – 15%What it is: FXNAX provides exposure to the U.S. investment-grade bond market, including government, corporate, and mortgage-backed securities.Why it's included: Bonds add stability to the portfolio, reducing overall volatility and providing steady income. This bond fund helps balance the higher-risk equities in the portfolio, making it more resilient during market downturns.Portfolio BenefitsThis allocation leverages broad U.S. and international exposure with a bond component to manage risk. The high allocation to FSKAX drives growth, while FSPSX provides global exposure to developed markets, enhancing stability. FXNAX’s bond component lowers volatility and offers income, making this portfolio a solid choice for steady, long-term growth. This balance of growth and security is ideal for a Roth IRA, where long-term, tax-free growth is the goal.Dividend PortfolioThis portfolio is designed with a mix of U.S. dividend stocks, international exposure, and real estate. Each ETF brings unique benefits, combining to offer both growth potential and dividend income.SCHD (Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF) – 30%What it is: SCHD focuses on high-quality U.S. companies with a track record of strong dividends.Why it's included: SCHD is known for its stability and growth potential, thanks to a selection process that favors financially strong companies. This makes it a solid foundation for dividend income while offering growth.2. DGRO (iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF) – 25%What it is: DGRO invests in U.S. companies with a history of consistently increasing dividends.Why it's included: This ETF focuses on dividend growth, which can help outpace inflation over time. DGRO balances current income with long-term growth potential, making it ideal for compounding.3. JEPI (JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF) – 15%What it is: JEPI uses a covered call strategy on large-cap stocks to generate additional income.Why it's included: JEPI’s strategy offers a higher yield than traditional dividend ETFs, providing a reliable income stream while maintaining a balanced risk profile. It’s excellent for consistent monthly payouts.4.

International dividend stocks can add resilience to market fluctuations, making this ETF great for long-term stability.7. VNQ (Vanguard Real Estate ETF) – 10%What it is: VNQ invests in U.S. real estate investment trusts (REITs), which own and operate real estate properties.Why it’s included: REITs offer a different type of income-generating asset, as they are required to pay out most of their income as dividends.

,,"Masters in Finance here, just buy market index funds. If you want really meta advice, follow Goldman Sach's guidance and just buy an equal weighted S&P 500 index. That basically gives it a value tilt.In conclusion, stocks tie pretty closely with their fundamental value, but you have to be very skilled to know that value. If you do want to track the fundamental, save yourself a ton of time and just find the highest rated analyst for your industry of choice. Being super meta, solar power is a very good bet right now before the election. Hareis is big on solar, and even if Trump wins, he would just raise tariffs on Chinese solar panels even further (China produces 85% of the world's solar panels) giving an advantage to domestic producers (certainly at the cost of passing +3°C, yikes).",0,0.526,NEGATIVE,0.997
