Don`t invest based on advice from ""analysts"". Dont`t invest based on ""Stock market"" TV/youtube stream sht shows. First look for videos about market makers are manipulating the markets to create liquidity (even the current ""carry trade flash"" is one huge manipulation). The manipulation is necessary to create liquidity and keep the spreads tight. I recommend to look for the channel on Youtube ""Confessions of a market maker"" and this will open your eyes. Read books about investing that are focused on the psychological side of it (my favourite: Trading for a Living by Dr. Alexander Elder). After doing so learn to ride the sharks (market makers).
