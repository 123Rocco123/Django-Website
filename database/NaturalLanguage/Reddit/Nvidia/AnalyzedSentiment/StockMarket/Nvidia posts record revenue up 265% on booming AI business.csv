,,This just shows how smart Google was to do the TPUs. Now working on the sixth generation with the fifth in production.They were able to completely do Gemini without needing anything from NvidiaThe one that is really hard to understand is Microsoft. Google did the TPUs well over a decade ago and in the open. It was not like a secret.How in the world did Microsoft not get it earlier? They are only starting now to try to copy Google and do their own TPUs.,0,0.519,POSITIVE,1.0
,,Sorry if I'm admin a solid question here. What is a TPU ?,1,0.574,NEGATIVE,0.995
,,"Tensor processing Unit. It is silicon that is optimized to process the couple of instructions needed for machine learning.Here is a very dated article that is more true today and explains why Google did the TPUs.https://www.wired.com/2017/04/building-ai-chip-saved-google-building-dozen-new-data-centers/The TPUs give Google a huge strategic advantage. They do NOT have to pay the 800% margins to Nvidia like Microsoft, OpenAI and pretty much everyone but Google",2,0.534,POSITIVE,0.999
,,why is google lagging in stock price against both nvidia and microsoft?why is gemini worse than gpt4?How their TPU compare to the nvidia gpus and cuda? seems all the players love nvidia,3,0.56,NEGATIVE,0.968
,,"google doesnt sell their tpus, therefore they arent making the same margins as nvidia right nowtheir business model is also much more than AI alone, which obviously impacts the share price, there are many possible reasons why google is/has been priced a certain waynot sure of gemini is actually worse and the quality of an AI model is a lot more important than the hardware it runs onits hard to comment on googles TPUs. It can however be said that AI training relies on one single type of calculation, which is matrix multiplication. Nvidia GPUs have tensor cores for this purpose, googles TPUs are a whole card with no other purpose than to do these calculations. There probably isnt too much difference between the two, since it is much easier to engineer a TPU that has literally just one single purpose than a GPU that is developed for a much more general application.",4,0.541,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,"so nvidia chips are multipurpose, gaming, mining, etc‚Ä¶ while googles are specific for AI and much cheaper? sounds too good to be true, howcome no one talking about this?",5,0.54,NEGATIVE,0.993
,,"purpose built chips have been around for a very long timeI think the problem is that developing such chips can still be fairly expensive, nvidia can make much better use of economies of scale by 1) making a lot more chips 2) using a ""one size fits all solutions"", as compared to producing smaller quantities of TPUsNvidia also has the expertise to make general purpose GPUs that perform wellIn addition, Nvidia also makes dedicated server GPUs that have a much bigger focus of AI and other server-related tasks while completely leaving out all gaming capabilitiesI think the point is that yes, Nvidia is in a market dominating position right now, but theyre by far not the only ones who are capable of doing AI as everyone seems to thinkother manufacturers see the same opportunities and i would be surprised if neither AMD or intel are working on their own AI solutions right now",6,0.549,NEGATIVE,0.984
