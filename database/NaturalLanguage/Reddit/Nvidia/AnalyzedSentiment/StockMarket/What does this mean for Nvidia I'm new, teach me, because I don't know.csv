,"So, it looks like the president and CEO has sold a boat load of shares in the last two weeks. What does this mean? Teach me","Here goes:All publicly traded companies have to report insider trading.‚Ä¢ Some will argue that insider selling is a sign that you should sell too.‚Ä¢ Some will argue that insider buying is a sign that you should buy too.Another often used aphorism is ‚ÄúInsiders sell for many reasons, but only buy for one reason.‚Äù ‚òùüèºUltimately, you ask ‚Äúwhat does this mean?‚Äù and by itself it means nothing. It‚Äôs simply a report to maintain compliance with SEC rules.WSJ, Barrons, and other media outlets will often run reports about news stories like this because the guessing game is irresistible clickbait.Sometimes even the CEOs or Executives will make announcements that they‚Äôre using the proceeds to buy a home, pay for kids college, or other routine life expenses.In this case of Nvidia, you will have to decide what is routine and not routine.Another few data points :‚Ä¢ Insiders often have blackout periods when they cannot sell, typically around quarterly and annual earnings releases, due to their ‚Äúmaterial nonpublic information‚Äù‚Ä¢ General Counsels working for the company and external legal, financial & tax advisers working for the executive will often pre-arrange sales of stock months in advance subject to certain conditions.‚Ä¢ Stock based compensation, such as RSUs and NQs, can have unique tax consequences often raising the need for selling of stock for cash to settle income tax liabilities.The points made above in comments that ‚Äúit‚Äôs all routine‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs them cashing out‚Äù are both equally likely to be true. In this area of business, there is rarely black or white, but instead gray.You will have to decide how this impacts your investment.",0,0.534,NEGATIVE,1.0
