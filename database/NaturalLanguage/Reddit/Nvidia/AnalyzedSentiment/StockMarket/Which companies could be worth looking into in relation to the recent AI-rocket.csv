,"I'm quite new to the stock market. I hope this question is OK to post here. I've been searching for companies that could be good investments as either suppliers or customers of the big tech companies and the AI-surge. Apart from the big ones in Microsoft and Meta, I've not really found much that's not hidden behind pay walls. Since I'm new and learning, I'm not investing large sums. I already have a small amount in Nvidia, Intel and AMD and looking to diversify and hopefully reap benefits in other parts of the chain. Any tips or list of stocks that could be worth looking into? Tips on further reading?","Google is my dark horse, I think it is quite possible they are going to win the AI race. They have the hardware (TPUs) and also possibly the best LLM right now - Gemini 1.5 Ultra - although it is possible that Claude 3 (Google backed startup) is better. In any case they are the OGs of AI and they are more than catching up with OpenAI. They have Waymo which is currently by far the best self-driving solution.I'd like Sundar to GTFO. Stock would skyrocket if that happens. Replace him with one of the AI guys like Demis.Currently the market somewhat irrationally hates GOOG. Well, I bought some NVDA (not enough, I was scared!) when it was still going down in December 2022. The same might happen to GOOG once the market sentiment shifts.One worry: Google corporate culture seems kind of messed up. C suite shakup and new vision and direction would be amazing.",0,0.539,0.999,NEGATIVE

They now have the fifth generation in production and working on the sixth.Look at the NVDA financials. They are getting some incredible margins. Google does not have to pay those margins like their competitors as they have the TPUs. They were able to completely do Gemini without needing anything from Nvidia.Then there is the Google data.

AI will increase productivity and inconceivable amount. taxation and regulation will be key, but the earning potential is beyond anything we can estimate at this time, so the true earnings values certainly aren't a ""hype"" long term. we are quite literally at the beginning of a new era. there will certainly be a lot of job losses short term, but the companies themselves will continue to do better and better. eventually there may even be a shift to what working actual is for us, the current model isn't sustainable. I personally feel the taxation structure will need to change so governments can get revenue from these productivity efficiencies to cover the gap in taxes they will get from the pleebs. AI won't take everyone's job. I and a lot of people i know in different industries already use in our jobs as a time saver",3,0.539,0.906,POSITIVE
