,Hi I have started investing a little here and now I kind of the the whole trading thing this isn't what I'm struggling to understand. I buy shares and it goes up in price and I sell it well its up and I make profit a small one but profit is profit. I am having trouble understanding I can buy In to nvidia currently $128.50 ish they sell thousands of graphics cards a day and it still stands at that price or do I have the wrong end of the stick and its the amount of shares bought please be nice lol.. I have made £1 profits but nothing serious I think if i had a better understanding I could profit more,Yeah I wouldn't buy into nvidia either way I'm just asking basically if I was correct and it is done by profits they make from selling their products? If so how come it's so low is this because of taxes etc their side? Or a lack in sales.I understand the buy low sell high part.,0,0.567,NEGATIVE,1.0

I have made £1 profits but nothing serious I think if i had a better understanding I could profit more,"u/Priestessofthemoon87The stock isn't ""low"" in price. The current price is only a few months old.Nvidia did a 10-for-1 stock split in June of this year. This means that the share price may look low now, at $128, but until June - just around 2 and a half months ago - you would have seen it as $128 multiplied by ten, meaning $1,028 per share. For every ONE share someone owned before the stock split was completed, that person will now - i.e. after the split - own TEN shares.You - and many people - probably wouldn't be interested in buying one Nvidia share at $1,028, but now that the company has split the stock at the rate of 10-for-1, it looks ""low"" at less than $130 per share.This is the reason why stock splits are done; people can buy more shares in a company which has done a stock split, and feel - in their minds - that the share price is low or more affordable; meanwhile, in reality the only thing that has changed is that the price is split-adjusted.",2,0.588,NEGATIVE,1.0

It's great that you're taking an interest in understanding how the stock market works. Let's break down your question and provide some clarity:Stock Prices: The price of a stock, like NVIDIA, isn't directly related to how many products the company sells daily. Instead, it's influenced by various factors, including but not limited to:Company performance (revenue, profit, growth prospects)Market sentimentEconomic conditionsIndustry trendsSupply and demand for the stock itselfShort-term vs. Long-term Investing: While it's possible to make small profits through short-term trading, it's generally more challenging and riskier than long-term investing.Understanding Value: A company's stock price reflects the market's collective opinion about its current value and future prospects. It's not always directly correlated with day-to-day sales or operations.Profit and Loss: Remember, while you can make profits when a stock price rises, you can also incur losses if it falls. It's important to understand and be comfortable with the risks involved.To potentially improve your investing outcomes, you can consider:Learning more about fundamental analysis and how to evaluate companies.Diversifying your investments across different sectors and asset classes.Thinking long-term rather than focusing on short-term price movements.Understanding your risk tolerance and investment goals.Please note, this is not investment advice.
