Low expectations are the key to success.Margin of safe is the next thing, learn how to recognise when something is cheap relative to it's earnigns, that way, even if the share price drops your wealth is not effected.Be like owning a house that pays you $1k per month, what do you care if the house price drops or rises? You are getting $1k per month. That is worth holding on to.Stocks dont pay you as much as housing and often you want the stocks to invest the money for you not pay you dividends which you get taxed.

The general rule of thumb is that once your income scales as you age, to have 6 months of bills in savings/money market account, then invest everything else. At 18, you probably aren't even close to that, but that's what you should be moving towards if you want to be well off during retirement.I dont know what your savings look like, but I'd probably start at €250 initially and park the rest in a money market account.",0,0.526,NEGATIVE,0.739

OptionAlpha has a great paper & podcast on how this simple strategy (selling covered calls on SPY) routinely beats just investing in SPY by 6-10% (if I recall correctly), but you need enough $$ to buy 100 shares of whatever you’re going to sell covered Calls against. With that in mind, SPY might be unattainable right now, and companies like BAC, RBLX, PINS, might be more realistic. I personally like RBLX because IV is higher (ask ChatGPT why higher IV is better when selling covered calls) and they’re hovering around $40/share right now. You can also ask ChatGPT to summarize the performance comparison between simply buying shares in RBLX vs. buying shares and selling 20 Delta covered Calls at 45 days to expiration.Any of the “big name” brokerages should be safe. I personally steer clear of Robinghood. Look at TD Ameritrade, Webull, Etrade, TradeStation, Interactive Broker. I’ve not heard of the other ones you mention.Good luck, & don’t follow the hype, instead, do your own learning & research & define your own goals!",0,0.524,NEGATIVE,0.993

In most countries, you should be able to find an account that shelters you from tax or capital gains tax, which is an incentive by governments to get people started in saving and building capital.

That literally is Warrenn Buffet's recommendation and that should be enough. People think the stock market is some playground. It is very far from it. The people who run it--instituitional (big) investors--are very good at what they do and will take your money. You have to be insanely good or lucky to beat the average annual returns of VOO or SPY. Please take these people's advice. Will they go down (VOO or SPY) initially? Very possible. But pay no attention to that. Just keep putting your money into it. If you want to test this theory, open up a fake stock account and see what happens with you picking stocks on your own.*And for the love of god do not use leverage (margin account money that the brokerage firm may allow you to borrow).",0,0.532,NEGATIVE,1.0
