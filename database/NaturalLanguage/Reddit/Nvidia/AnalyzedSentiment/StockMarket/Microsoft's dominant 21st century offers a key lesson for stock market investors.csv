,,"Microsoft was dead in the water for years when Steve Balmer was running the company. They missed the wireless revolution. I believe they were a laggard for close to fifteen years until Nadella took the helm and went full steam into the cloud. If you had the patience to ride out the lean years, you made a lot of money with the current surge. That said, itâ€™s very rare for companies to get second acts. They are an outlier.",0,0.554,NEGATIVE,0.998
,,"Yeah, there's a difference in technology stocks today because everything they do is on computers and there are many things software can do and it's limited only by people's ideas and the hardware available.In contrast, XOM was an oil company and there's not really much room to change their business unless they enter a new completely area with no expertise. The leap between Windows/Office to Azure is enormous in terms of impact, but relatively little in terms of new expertise needed.With that said, Ballmer performed badly as a CEO of a software company, but it'd be perfectly normal for most traditional companies.",1,0.585,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,Steve Balmer was CEO of Microsoft during the dot com bubble and GFC. Microsoft did ok during that time so Steve did exactly perform badly. Microsoft remained in the top 10 company by market cap since 1995. Canâ€™t really run down a software company that essentially have monopoly on desktop OS.,2,0.577,NEGATIVE,0.797
,,Msft did well under Balmer. The stock market =/= the economy,1,0.633,POSITIVE,0.82

,,Would you consider NVDA getting a second act? Mining kind of died but then AI came. It felt like luck.,1,0.531,POSITIVE,0.942
,,"Nvidia is way ahead of the curve with their artificial intelligence computer systems. Thatâ€™s another stock that was flat for an extended period of time. Almost a decade. The management team at Nvidia has been planning on dominating the AI market since they were primarily perceived as a graphics card company ten years ago. I donâ€™t think you can call that a second act. I donâ€™t want to get too off track here but the point I was trying to make about MSFT is that companies that dominate the S&P 500 from decade to decade donâ€™t repeat as new technology is introduced. If you look at the history of the market going back 70 years to the mainframe era, industry leaders come and go.",2,0.565,NEGATIVE,0.887
,,"Totally agree. idk Nvidia was planning AI for so long.Now I'm curious on what the short list of second acts are... even if the second act is dead now and they weren't in the top 100 even. Just companies that have two acts.. I remember giants of the past that just kind of ""exist"" now without influence (IBM, HP, GE, Exxon, GM etc)",3,0.541,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,"The two that I can think of off the top of my head are IBM and Apple. IBM dominated in the 1950â€™s and 1960â€™s with their mainframe computers but got out of favor when mini computers were introduced by companies like Wang and Digital. In the mid 1980â€™s they got a second life with the advent of the PC . Although IBM is a terrific company, the stock hasnâ€™t performed very well since the turn of the century. Maybe Watson will get them in gear if they can compete in AI. Apple was a good stock in the 1980â€™s, then got trounced by corporate adoption of Windows PCs in the workforce. They were out of favor for a decade until the introduction of the iPod. The rest is history.",4,0.546,NEGATIVE,0.999
,,"The emergence of artificial intelligence is an inevitable trend in the future.NVIDIA is expected to continue its leadership in AI as demand for AI-driven technologies continues to grow across industries. The company's continued innovation in GPU technology, AI software, and specialized platforms for industries such as automotive and healthcare positions it well for future growth. In addition, NVIDIA's strategic acquisitions, such as Mellanox and ARM (pending regulatory approval), are likely to further enhance its capabilities and market reach in the AI space.",2,0.579,POSITIVE,0.992
,,They also lost the mobile market and home console/entertainment by fumbling Windows Phone and Xbox,1,0.57,NEGATIVE,0.997
,,"I don't think they fumbled Xbox. Xbox is still out there, and gamepass is huge. There are still two major consoles - the PS and Xbox(Nintendo is its own thing). Could they have eaten more of Sony's pie? - sure, but that doesn't mean it's on the scale of Windows Phone, which is basically dead.",2,0.511,NEGATIVE,0.991
,,"In terms of market presence outside of NA and audience interest/acquisition Xbox has quite a hill to climb, considering their approach to marketing and service availability.",3,0.542,NEGATIVE,0.814
,,"What are you smoking my guy, PSN is not available to over 100 countries, remember the whole Helldivers 2 fiasco a few months back?The only issue for Microsoft has been exclusives. A lot of people I know are buying PS for games like God of War(back when it was just exclusive), Bloodborne, Last of Us(again, before), RDR, etc. Not because of service availability.",4,0.524,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,"So being completely unable to sell the Xbox anywhere outside of the USA is not a problem? They are being outsold by the PS5 3-to-1 and the god damn Switch is outselling Series X/S in its 7th or 8th year of lifecycleOr the fact that the only growth their gaming division has had this year is due to the Activision acquisition? Xbox hardware revenue decreased by 42% and they aren't sharing any GamePass financials so I doubt it's as successful as they would've liked. Without the Activision purchase, LinkedIn was bringing in more revenue at higher profit margins than their entire gaming division.Microsoft is by far my biggest holding, and I genuinely would not care at all if they just shut down the entire gaming segment tomorrow. Hell, I might even buy more because they've done very little right ever since the failed 360 -> One transition",5,0.532,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,"I genuinely think they are trying to move away from consoles all together. Gamepass is on pc now and they have been marketing that a lot.Sony is btw doing the same, by porting most of their exclusive titles to pc as well. The semiconductor shortage, due to potential conflicts, tariffs, and coin mining, is showing that the console business has to evolve. Something Nvidia is doing, and Google tried with Stadia.And please, don't mention Nintendo and Switch, it is not part of the conversation as it's not a contender for either of those consoles, there is no overlap, nobody is choosing between Switch and PS5. You are either a Nintendo fan, or not. If anything I think we should bring Steam to the table, they are the silent killer, imo.And as a major MSFT holder myself, I would say that I don't think Xbox is doing well, and I do believe they'll need to innovate a lot with their next iteration, but I am also liking the shift, and looking forward to what's coming.",6,0.519,NEGATIVE,0.999

,,Is it reasonable to argue that Balmer set them up for success by making the right investments?,1,0.517,POSITIVE,0.793

,,"He made fun of the iPhone.But maybe they had no way of catching up anyways so it was his only play? Seems like they could have made a major play though, and I think his reasoning was biased by the widespread love for Blackberry's physical keyboard (by BB users). iPhone touch tech was much better than what came before.",2,0.513,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,"Ballmer wasn't nearly as bad as he's currently made out to be. His timing was just ridiculously unlucky taking over right when the dot com bubble burst and presiding over the company during the 2008 crash so judging him by the stock price is not fair, it wouldn't have done well under Gates either.He definitely did whiff on the consumer device market but remember that he was the one who pushed Azure, which is currently their cash cow and growth driver",1,0.55,NEGATIVE,0.973
,,"Steve Ballmer has set up enterprise salesâ€¦ big misconception about him and what he did. He MADE sure that Microsoft stayed afloat when they had the monopoly case, he was the positive rock in the water on stage yelling developers was back then",1,0.518,POSITIVE,0.91
