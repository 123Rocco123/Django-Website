Mostly Tech portfolio.I put around 1k into FFIE before its big jump, but saw it was losing rapidly and sold. Next week, it jumps from $0.046 to $1.80, a 39x increase. You know i was pissed. Could've had college paid for and not have to struggle so much living as a young adult without parents.Cant remember which penny stock it was, but I was about to put 2k into one i was confident would jump, but I had military duties that would take up 99% of my day, so I didnt wanna risk it dropping while i wasnt able to watch. About a week later, I open the app to look at the stock, and it was up 100% from when I wouldve put the money in. I only had $150 in it, so I made $150 cuz i sold right there, but it couldve been $2k.Now im just buying low, selling high on NVDA, last trade bought 45 shares at 97.90, sold at 105 something a day or two later, waiting for dip to buy again. Gains, but not enough to satiate my noobish brain.",0,0.536,NEGATIVE,1.0

Too much risk involved. You can prolly do it with the R&R that you're doing, but all the posts I see of people losing 90% ect, is from bad options trading.
