I sold it as soon as I learned this. Maybe I’ll end up being wrong, but the whole reason I ever invested in TDOC was the assumption regulations were hard to comply with and my firm belief telehealth is cheaper, more efficient, and more convenient for many situation.

She has no authority at all considering ARK Innovation has got to be the WORST tech ETF ever.,"She said 2 things I think are wrong (but I'm also continually challenging those assumptions):There needs to be a software explosion to justify the ""overbuilding"" of GPUsCompetition will catch up and cool demand for NVIDIA chips.I think #1 is wrong because a) we're already seeing ROI on AI investment, and b) I think AI is just getting started. NVIDIA reported that still 60% of their chips are still doing training. I expect the trend of ramping up and gaining more AI capacity to continue in 2024. We may not see a splashy high-revenue AI gadget this year but we don't really need to.I think #2 is wrong because NVIDIA has been contemplating and building its AI stack out for 10 years. It's not just a chip, it's the software that is miles ahead of the competition. I don't think any competitor will catch up to NVIDIA enough to make a dent in their demand.Please if you have another opinion about this challenge my assumptions.

(Just look at Costco and Walmart, do they really have expansion and innovation opportunities to justify 30-50 P/E?)Especially trending stocks like NVDA I think it will get the TSLA peak treatment only that I don’t think NVDA will actually collapse because it’s not making empty tech promises.

We'll either see the Nasdaq have another down day or two and then chop around with the Nasdaq Composite failing to top 16449 while the S&P sets a new record or three, or see the Nasdaq move another 8-10% lower, led by chips, and then on the next rally, NVDA and/or the SOXX will fail to top Friday’s high and set a lower high.But in the meantime, I do think NVDA is going to hit $1000.

It seems here the exacerbated growth of NVDA has catapulted the entire tech sector to trillions of $$$ in stock growth.If our expectations fall short, will we expect a windfalls of the entire AI related fad? Like the dotcom boom? The entire industries stagnates and has to pull itself out again and prove its usefulness? We expect the foundations of LLMs to be exponential in growth but Lex Fridman’s interview with french computer scientist, Yann Lecun. He delves into the practical limitations of generative AI. How reasoning in LLMs are primitive, computations of tokens are inefficient, the amount of depth in the prompt question is regardless because the amount of computation per tokens produced in proportion tokens in the question is constant. Pretty interesting stuff to see from a sit down discussion with two people deeply interest in the field.This is entirely different from humans’ cognitive reasoning. When faced with a complex problem, humans spend more time to reason and build understanding. Current generative AI absolutely does not do this.The dotcom boom is a cautionary tale for investors today who fail to see the overall application and feasibility of ai.That being said, I am willing to gamble my savings as this is the turning point in human history :D",0,0.535,NEGATIVE,0.953

Going in with 10+ years timeframe, AI will take time to prove itself as a PRACTICAL tool.But I am willing to buy even knowing that there is a high probability prices will drop, because I know the impact will be so massive that once AI starts being involved in daily life it will boom to the moon.
