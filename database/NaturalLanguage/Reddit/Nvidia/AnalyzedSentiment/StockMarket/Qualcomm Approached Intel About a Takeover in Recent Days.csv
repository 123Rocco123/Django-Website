,"Qualcomm recently approached Intel with a takeover proposal, marking what could be one of the largest tech deals in recent memory, according to sources. Intel, once valued at over $290 billion, has seen its market cap fall to around $90 billion after a challenging year in which its shares dropped 60%. While a deal is far from guaranteed, Qualcomm’s interest comes as Intel struggles to recover under CEO Pat Gelsinger’s turnaround plan, which has yet to deliver significant results. Should Intel be receptive, the deal could face heavy antitrust scrutiny, though some argue it might bolster U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor industry. Qualcomm may consider offloading parts of Intel to complete the acquisition. Both companies have sought to capitalize on the AI boom, though they’ve lagged behind Nvidia. Intel, grappling with factory delays and cost-cutting measures, is receiving government subsidies as part of its efforts to build chip factories. A Qualcomm takeover could enhance its portfolio by adding Intel’s dominance in PCs and servers to its smartphone chip business. Despite this potential merger, Intel continues to face major hurdles, including the possible need to split its design and manufacturing operations amid growing calls for the company to separate its business divisions.
