,"Hello, I want to diversify my portfolio and I have recently been researching AI stocks. Although I have experience investing in ETFs, I'm not very well versed in trading stocks. I'm thinking about focusing on Nvidia and Intel, however I’ve heard a lot of conflicting opinions online as some people are saying that the bubble is about to burst for the AI industry. That said. both companies have achieved significant technical milestones over the past year, and according to Yahoo, the AI market is projected to grow at a annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030. Anyways, if anyone could give me any pointers or tips about investing in AI stocks then that would be hugely appreciated. Should I take the plunge and buy stocks in these 2 companies? Thanks.",I think the best time to buy Nvidia is 3 years ago lol,0,0.586,POSITIVE,0.94
