,Do you guys think it’s hit it’s bottom?,"☝️He's right.I mean the AI may be a bubble which as a Software Engineer I truly believe.But NVIDIA just provides the shovels for the gold pickers and has great profit so far.Will NVIDIA's stock collapse along with AI? My 5¢ it may fall significantly since investors will stop seeing increase in profit, but not as much or as fast as the gold pickers themselves. NVIDIA will just keep doing what it always does it existed far before AI.",2,0.567,POSITIVE,0.847
,Do you guys think it’s hit it’s bottom?,"I see AI as a race that will have 1st, 2nd and 3rd place making vast amounts of money from it and the rest will be non finishers. This is why so many companies are dropping so much money to try and get ahead of the race. This explains why they are dropping huge money on Nvidia H chips when the B's are out soon. First out of the gate and all that.",3,0.529,NEGATIVE,0.996
,Do you guys think it’s hit it’s bottom?,"Companies and especially investors have been throwing money at every trend in existence. From theranos, to blockchain, WeWork, NFTs oh man they’re so many tech gimmick companies and trends. They see a trend and think “yeah everybody thinks it’s cool so if we put all of our money we’ll be the best” without any due diligence. We’ve seen more scams and bad trends with a HUGE pile of money on them and no equal profit or straight up scams. Look at SoftBank, one failure after the other. Surprising how it still survives after losing Saudi Arabian billions worth of dollarsLike they have no vision. They just throw money into famous trends. I feel like it’s a FOMO since the 90-2000’s because of how many great companies were created these days and investors snubbed them and now they throw money at any potential “Google” and “facebook” in fear of missing out.LLMs have yet to find any other verge profitable use other than Glorified Google search. We’ve seen articles even saying “training $100b model” for fucking what? What’s the business model? Investors just throw money expecting x10 profits but that’s not how it works and they don’t seem to understand the technology at all",4,0.517,NEGATIVE,1.0
,Do you guys think it’s hit it’s bottom?,"Everything you say I agree with about investors in a stock market sense, but I'm talking about the Tesla's, Meta and Apples of this world, companies built on visionary moves so I'm trusting that these companies have visions for AI way beyond the average persons current comprehensions.",5,0.582,POSITIVE,0.999
,Do you guys think it’s hit it’s bottom?,"Tesla has literally been promising to bring self driving cars since 14’ for 17’ and past forward. Elon Musk has also said by 2024 we’ll be on Mars. And you trust that guy? He lied for years and keeps lying to people and investors. I won’t start talking about Cybertruck or the Tesla Truck. Also who the hell uses Grok? Nobody ever said “I’m gonna grok that”. It’s the Bing of the LLMs.Apple? The company with the worst ever Phone AI Assistant? I’m an iPhone 13 Pro user btw. I know best of any Android user how piece of sht Siri is. As I’ve also used Google’s Assistant for a hefty 5 years and it was always awesome. Also, you’re willing to trust the company who invested $10b on Apple car just so the project would be abandoned a decade after? Of all the companies that’s the company you’re gonna trust? The one with shitty AI and the one that failed to make a smart tech car at all?Meta? Sure they do some cool stuff. Their technical department has been one of the best out there. But still, they haven’t created anything revolutionary (AI related). They have Llama but it’s not a revolution. It’s just an Open source LLM which is good of them but nothing that different to cause an AI revolution. Still very cool tho but that’s all. But it’s the same company that in 2019 it was revealed they stored user passwords as plain text for years!It’s normal that you think “it’s a colossal company I’ll trust them” but you don’t understand that all these companies have some really stupid people in them and some really smart and often very important decisions are taken by the very stupid ones. These companies love money and will lie all the way and cut as many corners possible if that means they’ll get more investor money",6,0.552,NEGATIVE,1.0

,Do you guys think it’s hit it’s bottom?,"It's priced for perfection. Holders had better pray that orders exceed promises, chip performance is as good as promised, zero delays will occur in manufacturing and AI investment will keep soaring higher. But I see a lot of contrary press springing up, particularly with energy costs. This shit ain't cheap and its best use case contains no explanation where the massive revenues needed will come from. It's cool tech just like the Apple Vision Pro but we see how that worked out.",0,0.528,NEGATIVE,0.653
