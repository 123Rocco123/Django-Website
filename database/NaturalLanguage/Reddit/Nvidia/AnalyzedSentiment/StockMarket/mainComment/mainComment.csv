I ended up making a very dumb over leveraged trade which set me back about 7k (oh yeah, and I was unemployed for 5 months at that point because thought was going to be some hot shot trader) I decided to get a job and take a break from staring at candles all day which cleared my head.

I’ve added PLTR before the induction into the S&P after carefully consideration and research I believe that it could be a great player in the future especially after reading about how effectively it reduces the time of underwriting at insurance companies from 2weeks to 2hours. I believe that other companies will eventually have to invest in their products and services, maybe not now, but certainly in the future and this isn’t including their military side. I’m iffy on holding NVIDIA because of how much hype it’s gotten this year but it’s hard to gage how much demand is needed , i have no problem holding for the next year but after that I might sell. I’ve added 6 more shares of CRWD because I genuinely think that bigger companies in this day and age cannot operate without Cybersecurity. The last company i worked at (Cigna) uses Crowd-strikes malware scan and in the midst of CRWDs downturn with delta etc i had a good feeling that it would recover. AMZ remains my biggest holding and i think it’s still so undervalued. I’d like to hear your guys perspectives on the balance of my portfolio.

AMD’s MI300X AI chip aims to capture market share from Nvidia, which has seen its stock double this year due to high demand for AI GPUs. Despite a challenging year with shares down 6% in 2024, AMD remains the second-largest vendor of data center GPUs, trailing Nvidia. Investors are focused on AMD’s ability to grow its AI business, with the company anticipating $4 billion in AI chip sales this year, accounting for 15% of its total expected sales.

nan,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced on Monday its plans to acquire server manufacturer ZT Systems for $4.9 billion, as part of its strategy to bolster its portfolio of artificial intelligence (AI) chips and hardware, and to compete more effectively against Nvidia. The acquisition will be financed with 75% cash and the remaining in stock, leveraging AMD’s $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments reported in the second quarter. The rising demands of AI computing have necessitated the use of thousands of interconnected chips to achieve the required processing power, making the design and construction of server systems increasingly critical. This acquisition will enable AMD to enhance its capabilities in this area. According to AMD CEO Lisa Su, the addition of ZT Systems’ engineers will accelerate the company’s ability to test and deploy its latest AI GPUs on a scale required by major cloud computing companies like Microsoft. Although AMD plans to incorporate ZT Systems into its operations, it has no intention of competing directly in the server manufacturing market. Instead, the company plans to divest its server manufacturing business after the acquisition is finalized, with no discussions yet held with potential buyers. ZT Systems CEO Frank Zhang will join AMD, reporting to Forrest Norrod, AMD’s data center chief. The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2025, will see AMD retaining about 1,000 of ZT Systems' roughly 2,500 employees. AMD anticipates that the acquisition will positively impact its adjusted financial performance by the end of 2025.

nan,"Earnings from Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. will be crucial in guiding the Nasdaq 100 after a volatile period marked by extreme fluctuations. As the last megacaps to release results before Nvidia Corp. in August, these reports will set the tone for tech investors, particularly focusing on how artificial intelligence is driving growth in Amazon’s cloud-computing unit and boosting demand for Apple's next iPhone. The results will also provide valuable insights into the health of consumer spending, with Amazon shares already up about 25% this year. Amazon.com Inc. is set to release its Q2 earnings report after the market closes, with a conference call scheduled for 5:30 p.m. ET. Analysts project the company will report revenue of $148.8 billion, marking an 11% increase year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up from 65 cents in the same period last year. Amazon has guided for Q2 operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, signaling strong performance despite broader economic challenges. Key metrics expected by analysts include AWS revenue at nearly $26 billion, representing more than 17% year-over-year growth, and advertising revenue projected to reach $13 billion, a 21.7% increase from last year. The Stores segment, bolstered by events like Prime Day, is anticipated to show significant activity, while improvements in operating margins, especially in the North America segment, will be closely watched. Analysts also expect updates on AI initiatives and the overall capital expenditures for the year. Comments from analysts emphasize the importance of AI and cloud services for Amazon's future growth. Citi analysts, led by Ronald Josey, anticipate AWS revenue growth accelerated in Q2 due to generative AI tailwinds, while also predicting a beat in operating income thanks to improved retail efficiencies and strong advertising demand. Truist analyst Youssef Squali highlights Amazon's ability to gain share in global e-commerce and sees multiple growth vectors powering the company's continued expansion. Retail performance and consumer spending trends will be significant indicators, especially given mixed reports this earnings season. Analysts like Matt Stucky of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management note the importance of Amazon's retail margin expansion and its impact on profitability. Additionally, the potential for a surprise dividend announcement is a point of interest, as Amazon remains the last major tech company without a dividend program. Amazon's Q2 results will follow earnings reports from key competitors like Microsoft and Google, both of which had mixed receptions based on their cloud and AI performances. Wall Street's current focus is on tangible returns from AI investments, making Amazon's updates on its AI initiatives and AWS growth crucial for investor sentiment. The company's dominant position in the cloud market and ongoing efforts to enhance its e-commerce offerings will be under the microscope. Amazon saw its stock rise following a strong Q1 earnings report, showcasing impressive upside in both EPS and revenue. The standout metric was a significant 221% year-over-year increase in operating income to $15.31 billion, far surpassing the prior guidance of $8-12 billion. The company’s guidance for Q2 operating income of $10-14 billion also exceeded expectations. The Stores segment performed well, driven by successful shopping events like Amazon's Spring Deal Days in Europe and the first Big Spring Sale in Canada and the US. Faster delivery times, enhanced by regionalization efforts and cost-saving measures such as consolidating units into fewer boxes, boosted customer purchase frequency and overall spend. Additionally, Amazon is preparing for its 10th Prime Day event in July, which is expected to further drive sales. Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the highlight of the quarter, with a 17% growth in constant currency, an improvement from previous quarters. AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue business, with significant growth in both generative and non-generative AI workloads. The Advertising Services segment also showed robust growth, with a 24% increase in revenue to $11.82 billion, driven primarily by sponsored ads and early gains in Prime Video ads. Despite guiding Q2 revenue below consensus due to foreign exchange impacts, the strong performance in AWS and advertising has left investors optimistic.",0.5699,POSITIVE,0.9923

nan,"The problem areas in the USA: -------------------------- *- The Schiller PE is at a very high level. Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble. So stocks are highly expensive. *- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022! We are more of a service economy than a goods economy, *- World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle. That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local sales declines are offset. Additionally the trade war hampers both sides. *- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels. *- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers. You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term. People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank. However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials. AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth. AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales. So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia. This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW. I don't own any MKSI. This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording. So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN. Good areas: -------------------------------------- *- Labor productivity is up consistently since Q3 2022. one can see tradingeconomics dot com USA productivity *- Gasoline is lower than last year *- Retail sales are going fine, [ per a recent NPR radio article ] Nuetral ---------------------------------------- *- Labor force participation is not higher than Sept 2023. No more sales growth from people returning to work. Participation is up recently. tradingeconomics has this info. *- Consumer confidence is still down since January 2020.

This law used to mean that model performance would continue to increase with data and computation, but the scaling effect has now plateaued. Computing in the reasoning phase: To overcome pre-training bottlenecks, OpenAI and other labs are exploring “compute on test” techniques that enable human-like multi-step reasoning by allowing models to generate and evaluate multiple possibilities in real-time during the reasoning phase. This approach can be used more effectively for complex tasks such as mathematics and coding to optimize reasoning performance. Hardware Demand Shift: Market demand is likely to shift from large-scale pre-training clusters to inference clouds as new technologies reduce parameter requirements. This will weaken NVIDIA's monopoly in the training chip market, and the inference chip market may see more competition, especially as companies such as Groq may fill the new demand.

nan,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,NEGATIVE,0.9443

I’m Dan Howley, the tech editor at Yahoo Finance, and Nvidia has seemingly been at the forefront of virtually everything I’ve covered since ChatGPT hit the scene in 2022. I’ve been covering the tech space for 13 years and tracking Nvidia for even longer. I built my first desktop PC with an Nvidia graphics card in high school and have continued using its products ever since. Now I, like everyone else, am focused on Nvidia’s AI efforts, from reporting on how they’re dealing with the threat of increased competition to attending the company’s GTC conference to chatting with CEO Jensen Huang alongside my colleague Julie Hyman. With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia’s chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like AMD are gaining steam, and Nvidia’s own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant. How that plays out over the next few years is anyone’s guess. In today’s fiscal 2025 third quarter earnings report, Nvidia beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines on the strength of sales of its high-powered AI chips. 💵 Revenue: $35.08B vs $33.2B expected 💲 Adjusted EPS: $0.81 vs $0.74 expected 💾 Data center revenue: $30.8B vs $29B expected Nvidia also said it anticipates revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, for the fiscal fourth quarter. That's just ahead of Wall Street expectations of $37 billion. I’ll be back tomorrow, Nov. 21, at 10 a.m. ET to answer your questions about Nvidia’s latest earnings, the market reaction, and where the stock goes from here. That does it for me for today.

nan,"The current state of the stock market exhibits a stark contrast between the performance of mega-cap and small-cap stocks, as investors grapple with mixed signals from major corporations and broader market indices.  Recent developments have highlighted this divide, with Microsoft's upcoming earnings report set to further shape the narrative. Mega-Cap Weakness and Market Impact Microsoft, a key player in the technology sector, is set to report its earnings after the market close, and its performance could significantly influence investor sentiment.  The recent underperformance of large-cap stocks like Merck and Procter & Gamble, both of which have disappointed with earnings guidance, has contributed to the Nasdaq Composite's (-0.9%) and S&P 500's (-0.4%) downward pressure.  This weakness is reflected in the Vanguard Mega-Cap Growth ETF (MGK), which is down 1.1%. Small-Cap Resilience In contrast, small-cap stocks have shown relative strength, with the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 Value Index posting gains.  The equal-weighted S&P 500 is also holding its own, indicating that smaller companies are providing a stabilizing force in the market.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, buoyed by the financials and energy sectors, adds to this resilience. Sectors in Focus The IT sector, weighed down by NVIDIA's (-5.0%) decline ahead of AMD's earnings release, is leading the pack of losers.  Consumer staples, also negatively impacted, are lagging behind. On the other hand, financials, and energy sectors are posting gains, offering a glimmer of hope for investors seeking opportunities. Treasuries and Market Sentiment The Treasury market remains relatively calm, with the 2-yr note yield down to 4.38% and the 10-yr note yield at 4.17%.  Economic indicators, such as the better-than-expected consumer confidence index and the Bank of Japan's policy decision, have not sparked significant market movements, suggesting that investors are cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's FOMC decision on Wednesday. As we await Microsoft's earnings report, the stock market's divide between mega-cap and small-cap stocks is a cause for concern, especially for those relying on large-cap performance.  However, the resilience of small-cap companies and select sectors is providing a silver lining. Investors should stay vigilant, monitor market reactions to key earnings releases, and consider a diversified portfolio that takes into account the current market dynamics.  The Federal Reserve's decision will likely play a crucial role in determining the market's next course of action.",0.5419,NEGATIVE,0.9136

nan,"I think one of the main reasons Microsoft is a great long-term investment is its long history of generating a lot of free cash flow. At the time of writing, the company's free cash flow margin is over 30%, with free cash flow rising from $15.9 billion in 2009 to $74.1 billion in the last 12 months. This financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments. While Microsoft may not seem like a value investment, in my opinion, its pricing is reasonable given its continued revenue and earnings growth, and it's likely to continue for the foreseeable future. I estimate EPS growth of 13% on a regular basis over the next 12 months. Based on this projection, I have a price target of $482.40 and estimate that the stock will trade at a non-GAAP P/E ratio of around 36. Looking ahead, I expect Microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15% over the next 5 to 10 years. While this prospect necessitates buying the stock at a fair valuation, I believe the current price provides an opportunity. The company's forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is only 6.5% above its five-year average, while its forward diluted earnings per share growth rate is nearly the same at 5.8%. MSFT faces long-term potential headwinds One potential challenge to Microsoft's long-term growth in AI is that its adoption can be cyclical. Currently, the demand for AI systems is high, which has prompted Microsoft and other big tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion. However, when the current trend peaks (likely due to macroeconomic constraints), growth may slow. According to the TipRanks risk analysis tool, Microsoft is exposed to 32% risk from legal and regulatory factors, which is higher than the industry average and could impact its AI operations due to increased scrutiny of data privacy and AI governance. Given this outlook, I expect some volatility in Microsoft's long-term growth trajectory, although it may not be as good as NVIDIA NVDA -0.06% ▼ and so on semiconductor companies so obvious. As market sentiment fluctuates, cyclical price and valuation declines coincide with temporarily lower growth rates and may provide more attractive buying opportunities. There is also a risk that Microsoft and other Big Tech players could over-invest in AI infrastructure. With 21% of its risk related to Tech & Innovation, Microsoft’s heavy investment in AI-driven initiatives, including data center infrastructure, could result in lower-than-expected returns if industry growth does not meet expectations. This may impact free cash flow margins in the medium term, contributing to further volatility.",0.5607,NEGATIVE,0.8794

nan,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they’ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don’t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical. Yes, Nvidia’s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn’t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now. Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn’t possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia’s place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn’t happened and Nvidia’s only gotten stronger. That’s not to say over time Nvidia won’t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it’s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution. Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations.

Intel, once valued at over $290 billion, has seen its market cap fall to around $90 billion after a challenging year in which its shares dropped 60%. While a deal is far from guaranteed, Qualcomm’s interest comes as Intel struggles to recover under CEO Pat Gelsinger’s turnaround plan, which has yet to deliver significant results.

nan,Hey everyone After a long long hiatus and licking my wounds I decided to try trading once again. Recently I've been changing up my approach and doing 5-7 DTE spy options. And it's been going pretty decent however recently I got a couple of August 30th calls for Nvidia I managed to get in at a good position for 133 calls. My thesis is that it's going to keep pumping up to the day of earnings. I don't have any intention of holding the position up until expiration. My question is regarding theta decay and volatility. I know that the closer I got to the expiration the less profit I'll see as a percentage of my position. And I also understand that during high levels of volatility it can go both ways. And I'm not really asking for specific advice just kind of guidance or knowledge as to how that may affect my position. I'm holding them over the weekend and I'm expecting Monday to start off a little red but to finish off green and so I'm not quite sure if I want to sell half my positions and wait till earnings or if I should wait to earnings in general. I strongly believe that Nvidia is going to beat their earnings I just don't know how drastically that's going to affect the price action. Any and all input is definitely appreciated Thanks in advance,0.5421,NEGATIVE,0.9936

nan,"Super Micro Computer Inc.'s shares took a hit on Tuesday following a short report from Hindenburg Research that questioned the company's financial practices and transparency. Hindenburg's report alleged significant accounting red flags, undisclosed related-party transactions, and potential violations of sanctions and export controls. Initially, the report caused Super Micro's stock to plummet by as much as 8.7%, but it later rebounded to close down 2.6%. The server manufacturer has been a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, with its high-performance servers in high demand for data centers. This surge in AI-related demand has driven significant growth for the company, doubling its revenue to $14.9 billion in the most recent fiscal year. Despite a steep decline from its March peak, Super Micro's stock remains up over 90% for the year, reflecting continued investor interest in the burgeoning AI sector. However, the Hindenburg report could intensify scrutiny on Super Micro's accounting practices and client relationships, particularly as the company has faced regulatory challenges in the past. In 2020, Super Micro resolved a U.S. SEC investigation by correcting its financial statements and paying a penalty for accounting issues from 2014 to 2017. As the AI market continues to expand, maintaining investor confidence will be crucial for Super Micro, especially amid concerns about the profitability of AI-optimized servers and the potential for increased regulatory oversight.

nan,"Does anyone have any opinions on if this is a good investment? Given the recent AI boom everyone is focused on big players such as NVIDIA and AMD, but they are both supplied heavily by TSM for their chips. I don’t see much competition for TSM given they are so far advanced ahead of any American or Chinese competitor, and given the only increase in demand for AI technology, I don’t see how they wouldn’t grow. Yes the stock is expensive right now, but given the growth opportunity I would argue there is still plenty of room for expansion. Yes, China is a threat, but something tells me that China would not dare suffer the economic sanctions western nations would impose if they made a move in Taiwan. Trump has said he would likely put tariffs on the Taiwan semiconductor industry in order to grow domestic production, but still with tariffs, I don’t see big players switching to alternatives, as the gap between TSM and alternatives is very large.

nan,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

nan,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,NEGATIVE,0.9999

AMD to acquire server builder ZT Systems for 49 billion in cash and stock.csv,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced on Monday its plans to acquire server manufacturer ZT Systems for $4.9 billion, as part of its strategy to bolster its portfolio of artificial intelligence (AI) chips and hardware, and to compete more effectively against Nvidia. The acquisition will be financed with 75% cash and the remaining in stock, leveraging AMD’s $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments reported in the second quarter. The rising demands of AI computing have necessitated the use of thousands of interconnected chips to achieve the required processing power, making the design and construction of server systems increasingly critical. This acquisition will enable AMD to enhance its capabilities in this area. According to AMD CEO Lisa Su, the addition of ZT Systems’ engineers will accelerate the company’s ability to test and deploy its latest AI GPUs on a scale required by major cloud computing companies like Microsoft. Although AMD plans to incorporate ZT Systems into its operations, it has no intention of competing directly in the server manufacturing market. Instead, the company plans to divest its server manufacturing business after the acquisition is finalized, with no discussions yet held with potential buyers. ZT Systems CEO Frank Zhang will join AMD, reporting to Forrest Norrod, AMD’s data center chief.

AMZN Earnings Preview- What to watch for tonight.csv,"Earnings from Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. will be crucial in guiding the Nasdaq 100 after a volatile period marked by extreme fluctuations. As the last megacaps to release results before Nvidia Corp. in August, these reports will set the tone for tech investors, particularly focusing on how artificial intelligence is driving growth in Amazon’s cloud-computing unit and boosting demand for Apple's next iPhone. The results will also provide valuable insights into the health of consumer spending, with Amazon shares already up about 25% this year. Amazon.com Inc. is set to release its Q2 earnings report after the market closes, with a conference call scheduled for 5:30 p.m. ET. Analysts project the company will report revenue of $148.8 billion, marking an 11% increase year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up from 65 cents in the same period last year. Amazon has guided for Q2 operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, signaling strong performance despite broader economic challenges. Key metrics expected by analysts include AWS revenue at nearly $26 billion, representing more than 17% year-over-year growth, and advertising revenue projected to reach $13 billion, a 21.7% increase from last year. The Stores segment, bolstered by events like Prime Day, is anticipated to show significant activity, while improvements in operating margins, especially in the North America segment, will be closely watched. Analysts also expect updates on AI initiatives and the overall capital expenditures for the year. Comments from analysts emphasize the importance of AI and cloud services for Amazon's future growth. Citi analysts, led by Ronald Josey, anticipate AWS revenue growth accelerated in Q2 due to generative AI tailwinds, while also predicting a beat in operating income thanks to improved retail efficiencies and strong advertising demand. Truist analyst Youssef Squali highlights Amazon's ability to gain share in global e-commerce and sees multiple growth vectors powering the company's continued expansion. Retail performance and consumer spending trends will be significant indicators, especially given mixed reports this earnings season. Analysts like Matt Stucky of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management note the importance of Amazon's retail margin expansion and its impact on profitability. Additionally, the potential for a surprise dividend announcement is a point of interest, as Amazon remains the last major tech company without a dividend program. Amazon's Q2 results will follow earnings reports from key competitors like Microsoft and Google, both of which had mixed receptions based on their cloud and AI performances. Wall Street's current focus is on tangible returns from AI investments, making Amazon's updates on its AI initiatives and AWS growth crucial for investor sentiment. The company's dominant position in the cloud market and ongoing efforts to enhance its e-commerce offerings will be under the microscope. Amazon saw its stock rise following a strong Q1 earnings report, showcasing impressive upside in both EPS and revenue. The standout metric was a significant 221% year-over-year increase in operating income to $15.31 billion, far surpassing the prior guidance of $8-12 billion. The company’s guidance for Q2 operating income of $10-14 billion also exceeded expectations. The Stores segment performed well, driven by successful shopping events like Amazon's Spring Deal Days in Europe and the first Big Spring Sale in Canada and the US. Faster delivery times, enhanced by regionalization efforts and cost-saving measures such as consolidating units into fewer boxes, boosted customer purchase frequency and overall spend. Additionally, Amazon is preparing for its 10th Prime Day event in July, which is expected to further drive sales. Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the highlight of the quarter, with a 17% growth in constant currency, an improvement from previous quarters. AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue business, with significant growth in both generative and non-generative AI workloads. The Advertising Services segment also showed robust growth, with a 24% increase in revenue to $11.82 billion, driven primarily by sponsored ads and early gains in Prime Video ads. Despite guiding Q2 revenue below consensus due to foreign exchange impacts, the strong performance in AWS and advertising has left investors optimistic.",0.5699,"['POSITIVE', 0.9923]"

I'm wondering whether I should wait for it to drop, because most of the stock market is green this year, so I have a feeling it may drop since it grew so much, what do you think? Some of it just recovered from 2022 to it's pre-2022 state, but Nvidia has 205% growth this year, which is crazy Index funds - the legendary S&P 500. Everyone says it's the most stable etc - but I've found other indexes with even better growth. SP500 usually have the 7-10% yearly return and last 5 years went up 56%, but for example the INDEX Vanguard Growth ETF went up 87% for the last 5 years - and it was also a steady growth, not a lucky spike during one period. What do you think, is it really smart to go with SP500 or are there other ones that are much better, even tho SP500 is so hyped by everyone? and if you agree - what other indexes with better return would you recommend? Leverage - I'm not familiar with how much can you leverage in stocks, but for people that invest in the top 10, which most likely will go up in the future, wouldn't be smarter to invest it with i.e 5x leverage, since the companies like Microsoft are stable, and eventually will grow? Stock Math - let's say I invest $10.000 in a stock and it declines -50%. I know have $5.000. If it goes up by 50%, do I get $7.500 or do I get my $10.000 back?

Fundamentals behind a USA market drop this week & some positives.csv,"The problem areas in the USA: -------------------------- *- The Schiller PE is at a very high level. Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble. So stocks are highly expensive. *- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022! We are more of a service economy than a goods economy, *- World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle. That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local sales declines are offset. Additionally the trade war hampers both sides. *- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels. *- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers. You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term. People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank. However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials. AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth. AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales. So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia. This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW. I don't own any MKSI. This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording. So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN. Good areas: -------------------------------------- *- Labor productivity is up consistently since Q3 2022. one can see tradingeconomics dot com USA productivity *- Gasoline is lower than last year *- Retail sales are going fine, [ per a recent NPR radio article ] Nuetral ---------------------------------------- *- Labor force participation is not higher than Sept 2023. No more sales growth from people returning to work. Participation is up recently. tradingeconomics has this info. *- Consumer confidence is still down since January 2020.

This law used to mean that model performance would continue to increase with data and computation, but the scaling effect has now plateaued. Computing in the reasoning phase: To overcome pre-training bottlenecks, OpenAI and other labs are exploring “compute on test” techniques that enable human-like multi-step reasoning by allowing models to generate and evaluate multiple possibilities in real-time during the reasoning phase. This approach can be used more effectively for complex tasks such as mathematics and coding to optimize reasoning performance. Hardware Demand Shift: Market demand is likely to shift from large-scale pre-training clusters to inference clouds as new technologies reduce parameter requirements. This will weaken NVIDIA's monopoly in the training chip market, and the inference chip market may see more competition, especially as companies such as Groq may fill the new demand.

Intel Corporation INTC’s Latest Strides and Challenges.csv,"Key Takeaways: Innovation and expansion in new tech frontiers are key growth drivers. Long-term outlook hinges on successful execution of strategic initiatives. Intel unveils new AI chip to compete with Nvidia and AMD Intel’s total revenue in Q3 2023 was $14.2 billion, marking an 8% decrease from Q3 2022. Company Overview: Intel Corporation, a global technology leader, has been at the forefront of innovation in the semiconductor industry. Founded in 1968, Intel’s contributions have been pivotal in the evolution of computing technologies. The company specializes in manufacturing microprocessors, chipsets, embedded processors, and network interface controllers, among others. Intel’s Strategic Pivot Amidst Market Flux Recent times have been a mix of challenges and opportunities for Intel. The company, once the undisputed leader in semiconductor technology, faces fierce competition from rivals like AMD and NVIDIA, who have made significant inroads into Intel’s market share. The rise of ARM-based processors and the increasing demand for specialized chips for AI and data centers add to the competitive pressure. Intel’s response to these challenges has been multi-pronged. The company has accelerated its innovation cycle, focusing on next-generation chip technologies. Under the leadership of CEO Pat Gelsinger, Intel announced a significant investment in expanding its manufacturing capabilities, aiming to not only meet its own chip demands but also offer foundry services to other chipmakers. Moreover, Intel is actively diversifying its product portfolio. Its recent advancements in AI, edge computing, and autonomous driving technologies signify a strategic shift.  Leading AI models, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, predominantly utilize Nvidia GPUs hosted in cloud environments. This reliance has contributed to Nvidia’s stock soaring by approximately 230% since the beginning of the year, in stark contrast to Intel’s 68% increase. This trend underlines why competitors like AMD and Intel are now introducing their own chips, aiming to challenge Nvidia’s strong market presence. Although specifics were sparse, Intel’s Gaudi3 is set to rival Nvidia’s H100, a popular choice for entities constructing extensive chip networks for AI operations, and AMD’s upcoming MI300X. The Gaudi3 is expected to begin distribution to clients in 2024. However, these strategic decisions come with their own set of risks. The high cost of chip manufacturing and R&D, coupled with the uncertain global economic landscape, poses significant challenges. The company’s ability to execute its ambitious plans while maintaining financial stability is a key factor to watch in the coming years. Recent Financials: Intel Corporation’s recent financial performance reflects the challenges and resilience of a tech giant in a volatile market. In Q3 2023, the company reported a total revenue of $14.2 billion, a decrease of 8% from the same quarter in the previous year. This decline was primarily due to decreases in revenue across its major segments: the Client Computing Group (CCG) revenue decreased by 3%, the Data Center and AI Group (DCAI) by 10%, and the Network and Edge Group (NEX) by a significant 32%. The company’s financial strategy also reflects a commitment to operational efficiency and cost management. By streamlining processes and optimizing resources, Intel aims to improve its profitability and shareholder value in the long term. This approach is crucial as the company faces intense competition from other tech giants and emerging players in the semiconductor industry. In conclusion, Intel’s recent financial performance, though marked by challenges, showcases the company’s strategic efforts to remain a dominant player in the tech industry. The company’s focus on innovation, operational efficiency, and market adaptability will be key to its future success and financial stability. Financial Bullet Points: Revenue (Q3 2023): $14.2 billion, down 8% YoY. Client Computing Group Revenue: Decreased by 3%. Data Center and AI Group Revenue: Decreased by 10%. Network and Edge Group Revenue: Decreased by 32%. Gross Margin (Q3 2023): 42.5%, slightly down from 42.6% YoY. Net Income (Q3 2023): $297 million, a substantial decline from $1.019 billion YoY.

Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9443]"

Hi! I’m Dan Howley, the tech editor at Yahoo Finance, and Nvidia has seemingly been at the forefront of virtually everything I’ve covered since ChatGPT hit the scene in 2022. I’ve been covering the tech space for 13 years and tracking Nvidia for even longer. I built my first desktop PC with an Nvidia graphics card in high school and have continued using its products ever since. Now I, like everyone else, am focused on Nvidia’s AI efforts, from reporting on how they’re dealing with the threat of increased competition to attending the company’s GTC conference to chatting with CEO Jensen Huang alongside my colleague Julie Hyman. With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia’s chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like AMD are gaining steam, and Nvidia’s own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant. How that plays out over the next few years is anyone’s guess. In today’s fiscal 2025 third quarter earnings report, Nvidia beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines on the strength of sales of its high-powered AI chips. 💵 Revenue: $35.08B vs $33.2B expected 💲 Adjusted EPS: $0.81 vs $0.74 expected 💾 Data center revenue: $30.8B vs $29B expected Nvidia also said it anticipates revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, for the fiscal fourth quarter.

Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&P 500 gains.csv,"= just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing = The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023 https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9 The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions. It’s an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve’s inflation battle, noted FactSet’s Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post. The 10 top performing days for the S&P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%. The S&P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday’s close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%. Through Dec. 22, the S&P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%. Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said. That didn’t mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote. Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found. Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July. The strategy “indicates the Fed’s measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,” Jakobsen said. The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks’ bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group’s announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering. SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a “mini” banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown. Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks — Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78% , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, 0.16%, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%, Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%, Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%, and Meta Platforms Inc. META, 0.56%. See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024? Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind. The S&P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted. In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high: The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&P 500’s weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted. Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&P 500’s overall return, he wrote, with the company’s success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.",0.5482,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9995]"
Mega-caps vs small caps.csv,"The current state of the stock market exhibits a stark contrast between the performance of mega-cap and small-cap stocks, as investors grapple with mixed signals from major corporations and broader market indices.  Recent developments have highlighted this divide, with Microsoft's upcoming earnings report set to further shape the narrative. Mega-Cap Weakness and Market Impact Microsoft, a key player in the technology sector, is set to report its earnings after the market close, and its performance could significantly influence investor sentiment.  The recent underperformance of large-cap stocks like Merck and Procter & Gamble, both of which have disappointed with earnings guidance, has contributed to the Nasdaq Composite's (-0.9%) and S&P 500's (-0.4%) downward pressure.  This weakness is reflected in the Vanguard Mega-Cap Growth ETF (MGK), which is down 1.1%. Small-Cap Resilience In contrast, small-cap stocks have shown relative strength, with the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 Value Index posting gains.  The equal-weighted S&P 500 is also holding its own, indicating that smaller companies are providing a stabilizing force in the market.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, buoyed by the financials and energy sectors, adds to this resilience. Sectors in Focus The IT sector, weighed down by NVIDIA's (-5.0%) decline ahead of AMD's earnings release, is leading the pack of losers.  Consumer staples, also negatively impacted, are lagging behind. On the other hand, financials, and energy sectors are posting gains, offering a glimmer of hope for investors seeking opportunities. Treasuries and Market Sentiment The Treasury market remains relatively calm, with the 2-yr note yield down to 4.38% and the 10-yr note yield at 4.17%.  Economic indicators, such as the better-than-expected consumer confidence index and the Bank of Japan's policy decision, have not sparked significant market movements, suggesting that investors are cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's FOMC decision on Wednesday. As we await Microsoft's earnings report, the stock market's divide between mega-cap and small-cap stocks is a cause for concern, especially for those relying on large-cap performance.  However, the resilience of small-cap companies and select sectors is providing a silver lining. Investors should stay vigilant, monitor market reactions to key earnings releases, and consider a diversified portfolio that takes into account the current market dynamics.

MSFT faces long-term potential disadvantages.csv,"I think one of the main reasons Microsoft is a great long-term investment is its long history of generating a lot of free cash flow. At the time of writing, the company's free cash flow margin is over 30%, with free cash flow rising from $15.9 billion in 2009 to $74.1 billion in the last 12 months. This financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments. While Microsoft may not seem like a value investment, in my opinion, its pricing is reasonable given its continued revenue and earnings growth, and it's likely to continue for the foreseeable future. I estimate EPS growth of 13% on a regular basis over the next 12 months. Based on this projection, I have a price target of $482.40 and estimate that the stock will trade at a non-GAAP P/E ratio of around 36. Looking ahead, I expect Microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15% over the next 5 to 10 years. While this prospect necessitates buying the stock at a fair valuation, I believe the current price provides an opportunity. The company's forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is only 6.5% above its five-year average, while its forward diluted earnings per share growth rate is nearly the same at 5.8%. MSFT faces long-term potential headwinds One potential challenge to Microsoft's long-term growth in AI is that its adoption can be cyclical. Currently, the demand for AI systems is high, which has prompted Microsoft and other big tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion. However, when the current trend peaks (likely due to macroeconomic constraints), growth may slow. According to the TipRanks risk analysis tool, Microsoft is exposed to 32% risk from legal and regulatory factors, which is higher than the industry average and could impact its AI operations due to increased scrutiny of data privacy and AI governance. Given this outlook, I expect some volatility in Microsoft's long-term growth trajectory, although it may not be as good as NVIDIA NVDA -0.06% ▼ and so on semiconductor companies so obvious. As market sentiment fluctuates, cyclical price and valuation declines coincide with temporarily lower growth rates and may provide more attractive buying opportunities. There is also a risk that Microsoft and other Big Tech players could over-invest in AI infrastructure. With 21% of its risk related to Tech & Innovation, Microsoft’s heavy investment in AI-driven initiatives, including data center infrastructure, could result in lower-than-expected returns if industry growth does not meet expectations.

NVDA stock remains a BUY for me, and its upside could be even greater than previously expected. Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is on a path to exceed its earnings expectations next month when its Q3 report comes out. While an earnings beat is not fully guaranteed, the latest earnings results of the company’s peers, suppliers, clients, and businesses that have a connection to the generative AI industry point to Nvidia having a stellar performance in Q3. The demand for its AI GPUs remains high, the company has been receiving upward revisions recently, and its stock is trading around its all-time high levels with a potential to appreciate even further in the upcoming months.

Nvidia announces 50 billion stock buyback.csv,"Nvidia said Wednesday that its board of directors has approved a $50 billion stock buyback. The computer chip giant announced the share repurchase as part of its fiscal second-quarter earnings, in which it reported earnings and guidance that surpassed Wall Street expectations. Nvidia returned $15.4 billion to shareholders in share repurposes and cash dividends as part of the company’s first half of its fiscal 2025. The company said it had $7.5 billion remaining under its share repurchase plan, as of the end of its fiscal second quarter. Last year, Nvidia announced a $25 billion share buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results. Companies often experience a boom to their stock price after revealing stock buyback plans. In May, for instance, Apple announced a $110 billion stock buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results that showed overall sales fell 4% year over year and iPhone sales dropped 10% year over year. However, the iPhone maker’s shares rose 7% in after-hours trading, likely because Apple’s share buyback was the biggest in corporate history. With Nvidia’s shares dropping 4% in extended trading despite reporting solid financial results and announcing a stock buyback, some experts believe the company has been doing so well that it is getting harder to impress investors.

Nvidia More Room to Run Just Getting Started.csv,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they’ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don’t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical. Yes, Nvidia’s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn’t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now. Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn’t possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia’s place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn’t happened and Nvidia’s only gotten stronger. That’s not to say over time Nvidia won’t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it’s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution. Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations.

Powell's comments on interest rates, the economy, and any indication that inflationary pressures are driving a reassessment of the Fed's present aims will be scrutinized. On the corporate front, Nvidia headlines the earnings story this week, with the chipmaker scheduled to publish data from a quarter that caused the chipmaker to increase its revenue forecast by 50%. Lowe's, BJ's Wholesale Club, and Peloton are also set to announce earnings this week. August is shaping up to be the worst month for stocks this year, with all three main averages closing last week lower after a hawkish read of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting sent equities lower and Treasury rates higher in the second half of the week. Economic data continues to come in stronger than expected, with the July retail sales report indicating a 0.7% increase in sales for the month, about double what economists forecast. The AtlantaFed's GDPNow projection now predicts third-quarter GDP growth of 5.8%, the strongest rate since the fourth quarter of 2021. Inflation has declined dramatically since Powell's Jackson Hole speech last year, when he predicted rates will climb until the ""job is done,"" lowering inflation. Powell has stated as recently as July that inflation is ""well above"" the Fed's long-run objective of 2%.

Qualcomm Approached Intel About a Takeover in Recent Days.csv,"Qualcomm recently approached Intel with a takeover proposal, marking what could be one of the largest tech deals in recent memory, according to sources. Intel, once valued at over $290 billion, has seen its market cap fall to around $90 billion after a challenging year in which its shares dropped 60%. While a deal is far from guaranteed, Qualcomm’s interest comes as Intel struggles to recover under CEO Pat Gelsinger’s turnaround plan, which has yet to deliver significant results. Should Intel be receptive, the deal could face heavy antitrust scrutiny, though some argue it might bolster U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor industry. Qualcomm may consider offloading parts of Intel to complete the acquisition. Both companies have sought to capitalize on the AI boom, though they’ve lagged behind Nvidia. Intel, grappling with factory delays and cost-cutting measures, is receiving government subsidies as part of its efforts to build chip factories. A Qualcomm takeover could enhance its portfolio by adding Intel’s dominance in PCs and servers to its smartphone chip business. Despite this potential merger, Intel continues to face major hurdles, including the possible need to split its design and manufacturing operations amid growing calls for the company to separate its business divisions.

Serious question from someone who took a four-year trading break.csv,Hey everyone After a long long hiatus and licking my wounds I decided to try trading once again. Recently I've been changing up my approach and doing 5-7 DTE spy options. And it's been going pretty decent however recently I got a couple of August 30th calls for Nvidia I managed to get in at a good position for 133 calls. My thesis is that it's going to keep pumping up to the day of earnings. I don't have any intention of holding the position up until expiration. My question is regarding theta decay and volatility. I know that the closer I got to the expiration the less profit I'll see as a percentage of my position. And I also understand that during high levels of volatility it can go both ways. And I'm not really asking for specific advice just kind of guidance or knowledge as to how that may affect my position. I'm holding them over the weekend and I'm expecting Monday to start off a little red but to finish off green and so I'm not quite sure if I want to sell half my positions and wait till earnings or if I should wait to earnings in general.

Super Micro Falls as Hindenburg Takes Aim With Short Report.csv,"Super Micro Computer Inc.'s shares took a hit on Tuesday following a short report from Hindenburg Research that questioned the company's financial practices and transparency. Hindenburg's report alleged significant accounting red flags, undisclosed related-party transactions, and potential violations of sanctions and export controls. Initially, the report caused Super Micro's stock to plummet by as much as 8.7%, but it later rebounded to close down 2.6%. The server manufacturer has been a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, with its high-performance servers in high demand for data centers. This surge in AI-related demand has driven significant growth for the company, doubling its revenue to $14.9 billion in the most recent fiscal year. Despite a steep decline from its March peak, Super Micro's stock remains up over 90% for the year, reflecting continued investor interest in the burgeoning AI sector. However, the Hindenburg report could intensify scrutiny on Super Micro's accounting practices and client relationships, particularly as the company has faced regulatory challenges in the past. In 2020, Super Micro resolved a U.S. SEC investigation by correcting its financial statements and paying a penalty for accounting issues from 2014 to 2017. As the AI market continues to expand, maintaining investor confidence will be crucial for Super Micro, especially amid concerns about the profitability of AI-optimized servers and the potential for increased regulatory oversight.

This happens when the leadership in the market changes from bulls to bears or bears to bulls. These trend changes are what every trader looks for. If they can accurately predict market turns, they can profit. That’s why they do what they do. Sometimes this change of leadership is slow and takes a long period of time to happen. These changes have price action that tends to show up on a chart as a ‘Rounded Top’ or ‘Rounded Bottom’ pattern. Sometimes the reversal is abrupt and takes place over a few time periods. This action tends to show up on a chart as a ‘V’ or ‘Inverted V’ reversal. But sometimes the trend changes just in one day... These dynamics can show up on a chart as a ‘Reversal Day’ pattern. One may have just happened in the stock of Nivida (NVDA). The Western world would call it an ‘Outside Reversal Day’. In candlestick terminology, it is called a ‘Bearish Engulfing Pattern’. It’s important to note that these candlestick patterns are at least 700 years old. They were developed by Japanese rice traders. It shows that the human nature which is illustrated in charts hasn’t changed. The name doesn’t matter. The action that it illustrates does. On Friday morning, it looked as though the uptrend in NVDA was going to continue for yet another day. It opened at a higher price than Thursday’s close. But then the tide turned… Over the day, the sellers came out of the woodwork. And not only did they hold off the assault. They overpowered the buyers and eventually pushed the price much lower.

Yes, China is a threat, but something tells me that China would not dare suffer the economic sanctions western nations would impose if they made a move in Taiwan.

TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand.csv,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

Along with main clients like NVIDIA and AMD and APPLE looked to work on AI. HPC revenue has growth i think 30% in their last 2 quarters. They are also mass producing 3nm chips which is starting to make up a nice chunk of their revenue. My main concern is obviously china but also that they are too tied to nvidia. Whenever i see them in the market, if NVIDIA is up 3%, they are up 6%, but if NVIDIA is down 3%, they are down 6-7%. Is it still a buy even though it has risen almost 50% this year?

Understand this about INTC.csv,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9999]"

This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings: Data Sources: SPY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Schwab, Yahoo Finance. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST) SFY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Zacks.com, Yahoo Finance. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST) Key Observations: Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting. It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation. I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors: Expense Ratio: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. Stock Selection Methodology: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. Performance Trends: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. Portfolio Diversification: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. Market Positioning: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. Innovative Approach of SoFi: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy.

"Why Are Analysts Increasing NVIDIA’s Price Target Is It Out of Fear That Something Bad Will Happen, .csv","NVIDIA, often considered the heart of AI stocks, has recently been in the spotlight as analysts uniformly raise their stock targets. To me, this trend seems somewhat peculiar, even considering the current earnings season. The buoyant optimism surrounding the stock’s potential rise is sparking doubt in my mind. Should the stock underperform, it will be a litmus test of these analysts’ sincerity, raising questions about whether they may be manipulating public sentiment. In the broader context of the semiconductor sector, the recent quarterly earnings have been largely underwhelming. Yet, all semiconductor stocks appear to be buoyed by NVIDIA’s momentum. A stumble in NVIDIA’s stock could trigger a broader tech market downfall, while success could reignite a bullish trend for tech stocks.

AMD to acquire server builder ZT Systems for 49 billion in cash and stock.csv,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced on Monday its plans to acquire server manufacturer ZT Systems for $4.9 billion, as part of its strategy to bolster its portfolio of artificial intelligence (AI) chips and hardware, and to compete more effectively against Nvidia. The acquisition will be financed with 75% cash and the remaining in stock, leveraging AMD’s $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments reported in the second quarter. The rising demands of AI computing have necessitated the use of thousands of interconnected chips to achieve the required processing power, making the design and construction of server systems increasingly critical. This acquisition will enable AMD to enhance its capabilities in this area. According to AMD CEO Lisa Su, the addition of ZT Systems’ engineers will accelerate the company’s ability to test and deploy its latest AI GPUs on a scale required by major cloud computing companies like Microsoft. Although AMD plans to incorporate ZT Systems into its operations, it has no intention of competing directly in the server manufacturing market. Instead, the company plans to divest its server manufacturing business after the acquisition is finalized, with no discussions yet held with potential buyers. ZT Systems CEO Frank Zhang will join AMD, reporting to Forrest Norrod, AMD’s data center chief. The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2025, will see AMD retaining about 1,000 of ZT Systems' roughly 2,500 employees. AMD anticipates that the acquisition will positively impact its adjusted financial performance by the end of 2025.

AMZN Earnings Preview- What to watch for tonight.csv,"Earnings from Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. will be crucial in guiding the Nasdaq 100 after a volatile period marked by extreme fluctuations. As the last megacaps to release results before Nvidia Corp. in August, these reports will set the tone for tech investors, particularly focusing on how artificial intelligence is driving growth in Amazon’s cloud-computing unit and boosting demand for Apple's next iPhone. The results will also provide valuable insights into the health of consumer spending, with Amazon shares already up about 25% this year. Amazon.com Inc. is set to release its Q2 earnings report after the market closes, with a conference call scheduled for 5:30 p.m. ET. Analysts project the company will report revenue of $148.8 billion, marking an 11% increase year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up from 65 cents in the same period last year. Amazon has guided for Q2 operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, signaling strong performance despite broader economic challenges. Key metrics expected by analysts include AWS revenue at nearly $26 billion, representing more than 17% year-over-year growth, and advertising revenue projected to reach $13 billion, a 21.7% increase from last year. The Stores segment, bolstered by events like Prime Day, is anticipated to show significant activity, while improvements in operating margins, especially in the North America segment, will be closely watched. Analysts also expect updates on AI initiatives and the overall capital expenditures for the year. Comments from analysts emphasize the importance of AI and cloud services for Amazon's future growth. Citi analysts, led by Ronald Josey, anticipate AWS revenue growth accelerated in Q2 due to generative AI tailwinds, while also predicting a beat in operating income thanks to improved retail efficiencies and strong advertising demand. Truist analyst Youssef Squali highlights Amazon's ability to gain share in global e-commerce and sees multiple growth vectors powering the company's continued expansion. Retail performance and consumer spending trends will be significant indicators, especially given mixed reports this earnings season. Analysts like Matt Stucky of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management note the importance of Amazon's retail margin expansion and its impact on profitability. Additionally, the potential for a surprise dividend announcement is a point of interest, as Amazon remains the last major tech company without a dividend program. Amazon's Q2 results will follow earnings reports from key competitors like Microsoft and Google, both of which had mixed receptions based on their cloud and AI performances. Wall Street's current focus is on tangible returns from AI investments, making Amazon's updates on its AI initiatives and AWS growth crucial for investor sentiment. The company's dominant position in the cloud market and ongoing efforts to enhance its e-commerce offerings will be under the microscope. Amazon saw its stock rise following a strong Q1 earnings report, showcasing impressive upside in both EPS and revenue. The standout metric was a significant 221% year-over-year increase in operating income to $15.31 billion, far surpassing the prior guidance of $8-12 billion. The company’s guidance for Q2 operating income of $10-14 billion also exceeded expectations. The Stores segment performed well, driven by successful shopping events like Amazon's Spring Deal Days in Europe and the first Big Spring Sale in Canada and the US. Faster delivery times, enhanced by regionalization efforts and cost-saving measures such as consolidating units into fewer boxes, boosted customer purchase frequency and overall spend. Additionally, Amazon is preparing for its 10th Prime Day event in July, which is expected to further drive sales. Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the highlight of the quarter, with a 17% growth in constant currency, an improvement from previous quarters. AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue business, with significant growth in both generative and non-generative AI workloads. The Advertising Services segment also showed robust growth, with a 24% increase in revenue to $11.82 billion, driven primarily by sponsored ads and early gains in Prime Video ads. Despite guiding Q2 revenue below consensus due to foreign exchange impacts, the strong performance in AWS and advertising has left investors optimistic.",0.5699,"['POSITIVE', 0.9923]"

Everyone says it's the most stable etc - but I've found other indexes with even better growth. SP500 usually have the 7-10% yearly return and last 5 years went up 56%, but for example the INDEX Vanguard Growth ETF went up 87% for the last 5 years - and it was also a steady growth, not a lucky spike during one period. What do you think, is it really smart to go with SP500 or are there other ones that are much better, even tho SP500 is so hyped by everyone? and if you agree - what other indexes with better return would you recommend? Leverage - I'm not familiar with how much can you leverage in stocks, but for people that invest in the top 10, which most likely will go up in the future, wouldn't be smarter to invest it with i.e 5x leverage, since the companies like Microsoft are stable, and eventually will grow? Stock Math - let's say I invest $10.000 in a stock and it declines -50%. I know have $5.000. If it goes up by 50%, do I get $7.500 or do I get my $10.000 back?

Additionally the trade war hampers both sides. *- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels. *- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers. You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term. People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank. However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials. AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth. AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales. So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia. This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW. I don't own any MKSI. This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording. So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN.

This law used to mean that model performance would continue to increase with data and computation, but the scaling effect has now plateaued. Computing in the reasoning phase: To overcome pre-training bottlenecks, OpenAI and other labs are exploring “compute on test” techniques that enable human-like multi-step reasoning by allowing models to generate and evaluate multiple possibilities in real-time during the reasoning phase. This approach can be used more effectively for complex tasks such as mathematics and coding to optimize reasoning performance. Hardware Demand Shift: Market demand is likely to shift from large-scale pre-training clusters to inference clouds as new technologies reduce parameter requirements. This will weaken NVIDIA's monopoly in the training chip market, and the inference chip market may see more competition, especially as companies such as Groq may fill the new demand.

Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9443]"

Hi! I’m Dan Howley, the tech editor at Yahoo Finance, and Nvidia has seemingly been at the forefront of virtually everything I’ve covered since ChatGPT hit the scene in 2022. I’ve been covering the tech space for 13 years and tracking Nvidia for even longer. I built my first desktop PC with an Nvidia graphics card in high school and have continued using its products ever since. Now I, like everyone else, am focused on Nvidia’s AI efforts, from reporting on how they’re dealing with the threat of increased competition to attending the company’s GTC conference to chatting with CEO Jensen Huang alongside my colleague Julie Hyman. With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia’s chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like AMD are gaining steam, and Nvidia’s own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant. How that plays out over the next few years is anyone’s guess.

Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&P 500 gains.csv,"= just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing = The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023 https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9 The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions. It’s an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve’s inflation battle, noted FactSet’s Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post. The 10 top performing days for the S&P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%. The S&P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday’s close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%. Through Dec. 22, the S&P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%. Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said. That didn’t mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote. Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found. Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July. The strategy “indicates the Fed’s measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,” Jakobsen said. The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks’ bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group’s announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering. SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a “mini” banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown. Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks — Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78% , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, 0.16%, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%, Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%, Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%, and Meta Platforms Inc. META, 0.56%. See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024? Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind. The S&P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted. In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high: The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&P 500’s weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted. Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&P 500’s overall return, he wrote, with the company’s success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.",0.5482,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9995]"
Mega-caps vs small caps.csv,"The current state of the stock market exhibits a stark contrast between the performance of mega-cap and small-cap stocks, as investors grapple with mixed signals from major corporations and broader market indices.  Recent developments have highlighted this divide, with Microsoft's upcoming earnings report set to further shape the narrative. Mega-Cap Weakness and Market Impact Microsoft, a key player in the technology sector, is set to report its earnings after the market close, and its performance could significantly influence investor sentiment.  The recent underperformance of large-cap stocks like Merck and Procter & Gamble, both of which have disappointed with earnings guidance, has contributed to the Nasdaq Composite's (-0.9%) and S&P 500's (-0.4%) downward pressure.  This weakness is reflected in the Vanguard Mega-Cap Growth ETF (MGK), which is down 1.1%. Small-Cap Resilience In contrast, small-cap stocks have shown relative strength, with the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 Value Index posting gains.  The equal-weighted S&P 500 is also holding its own, indicating that smaller companies are providing a stabilizing force in the market.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, buoyed by the financials and energy sectors, adds to this resilience. Sectors in Focus The IT sector, weighed down by NVIDIA's (-5.0%) decline ahead of AMD's earnings release, is leading the pack of losers.  Consumer staples, also negatively impacted, are lagging behind. On the other hand, financials, and energy sectors are posting gains, offering a glimmer of hope for investors seeking opportunities. Treasuries and Market Sentiment The Treasury market remains relatively calm, with the 2-yr note yield down to 4.38% and the 10-yr note yield at 4.17%.  Economic indicators, such as the better-than-expected consumer confidence index and the Bank of Japan's policy decision, have not sparked significant market movements, suggesting that investors are cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's FOMC decision on Wednesday. As we await Microsoft's earnings report, the stock market's divide between mega-cap and small-cap stocks is a cause for concern, especially for those relying on large-cap performance.  However, the resilience of small-cap companies and select sectors is providing a silver lining. Investors should stay vigilant, monitor market reactions to key earnings releases, and consider a diversified portfolio that takes into account the current market dynamics.  The Federal Reserve's decision will likely play a crucial role in determining the market's next course of action.",0.5419,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9136]"

MSFT faces long-term potential disadvantages.csv,"I think one of the main reasons Microsoft is a great long-term investment is its long history of generating a lot of free cash flow. At the time of writing, the company's free cash flow margin is over 30%, with free cash flow rising from $15.9 billion in 2009 to $74.1 billion in the last 12 months. This financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments. While Microsoft may not seem like a value investment, in my opinion, its pricing is reasonable given its continued revenue and earnings growth, and it's likely to continue for the foreseeable future. I estimate EPS growth of 13% on a regular basis over the next 12 months. Based on this projection, I have a price target of $482.40 and estimate that the stock will trade at a non-GAAP P/E ratio of around 36. Looking ahead, I expect Microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15% over the next 5 to 10 years. While this prospect necessitates buying the stock at a fair valuation, I believe the current price provides an opportunity. The company's forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is only 6.5% above its five-year average, while its forward diluted earnings per share growth rate is nearly the same at 5.8%. MSFT faces long-term potential headwinds One potential challenge to Microsoft's long-term growth in AI is that its adoption can be cyclical. Currently, the demand for AI systems is high, which has prompted Microsoft and other big tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion. However, when the current trend peaks (likely due to macroeconomic constraints), growth may slow. According to the TipRanks risk analysis tool, Microsoft is exposed to 32% risk from legal and regulatory factors, which is higher than the industry average and could impact its AI operations due to increased scrutiny of data privacy and AI governance. Given this outlook, I expect some volatility in Microsoft's long-term growth trajectory, although it may not be as good as NVIDIA NVDA -0.06% ▼ and so on semiconductor companies so obvious. As market sentiment fluctuates, cyclical price and valuation declines coincide with temporarily lower growth rates and may provide more attractive buying opportunities. There is also a risk that Microsoft and other Big Tech players could over-invest in AI infrastructure. With 21% of its risk related to Tech & Innovation, Microsoft’s heavy investment in AI-driven initiatives, including data center infrastructure, could result in lower-than-expected returns if industry growth does not meet expectations. This may impact free cash flow margins in the medium term, contributing to further volatility.",0.5607,"['NEGATIVE', 0.8794]"

Nvidia returned $15.4 billion to shareholders in share repurposes and cash dividends as part of the company’s first half of its fiscal 2025. The company said it had $7.5 billion remaining under its share repurchase plan, as of the end of its fiscal second quarter. Last year, Nvidia announced a $25 billion share buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results. Companies often experience a boom to their stock price after revealing stock buyback plans. In May, for instance, Apple announced a $110 billion stock buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results that showed overall sales fell 4% year over year and iPhone sales dropped 10% year over year. However, the iPhone maker’s shares rose 7% in after-hours trading, likely because Apple’s share buyback was the biggest in corporate history. With Nvidia’s shares dropping 4% in extended trading despite reporting solid financial results and announcing a stock buyback, some experts believe the company has been doing so well that it is getting harder to impress investors.

Nvidia More Room to Run Just Getting Started.csv,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they’ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don’t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical. Yes, Nvidia’s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn’t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now. Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn’t possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia’s place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn’t happened and Nvidia’s only gotten stronger. That’s not to say over time Nvidia won’t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it’s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution. Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations.

"Nvidia reports earnings, Fed gathers in Jackson Hole What about this week.csv","In the final week of August, investors will be focused on two major events: Nvidia's earnings and the Federal Reserve's annual meeting in Jackson Hole. The Jackson Hole Economic Symposium will kick off on Thursday, with Fed Chair Jay Powell's address serving as the major event. Powell's comments on interest rates, the economy, and any indication that inflationary pressures are driving a reassessment of the Fed's present aims will be scrutinized. On the corporate front, Nvidia headlines the earnings story this week, with the chipmaker scheduled to publish data from a quarter that caused the chipmaker to increase its revenue forecast by 50%. Lowe's, BJ's Wholesale Club, and Peloton are also set to announce earnings this week. August is shaping up to be the worst month for stocks this year, with all three main averages closing last week lower after a hawkish read of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting sent equities lower and Treasury rates higher in the second half of the week. Economic data continues to come in stronger than expected, with the July retail sales report indicating a 0.7% increase in sales for the month, about double what economists forecast. The AtlantaFed's GDPNow projection now predicts third-quarter GDP growth of 5.8%, the strongest rate since the fourth quarter of 2021.

Looking further ahead, Oracle projects over $104 billion in revenue by fiscal 2029, along with a 20% year-over-year growth in earnings per share. Speaking at the Oracle CloudWorld event in Las Vegas, CEO Safra Catz expressed confidence in achieving these ambitious targets, pointing to new partnerships that allow Oracle’s database software to be offered through major cloud providers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Oracle’s strong performance continued this week as its stock gained roughly 15% over the past three trading days, setting a new record and marking a 55% increase for the year—second only to Nvidia among large-cap tech companies. Oracle’s cloud infrastructure revenue jumped 45% last quarter, outpacing its competitors and benefiting from businesses transitioning their workloads to the cloud. The company is also positioning itself to capitalize on the growing demand for artificial intelligence, announcing its cloud unit has secured orders for over 131,000 next-generation Nvidia GPUs.

Qualcomm Approached Intel About a Takeover in Recent Days.csv,"Qualcomm recently approached Intel with a takeover proposal, marking what could be one of the largest tech deals in recent memory, according to sources. Intel, once valued at over $290 billion, has seen its market cap fall to around $90 billion after a challenging year in which its shares dropped 60%. While a deal is far from guaranteed, Qualcomm’s interest comes as Intel struggles to recover under CEO Pat Gelsinger’s turnaround plan, which has yet to deliver significant results. Should Intel be receptive, the deal could face heavy antitrust scrutiny, though some argue it might bolster U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor industry. Qualcomm may consider offloading parts of Intel to complete the acquisition. Both companies have sought to capitalize on the AI boom, though they’ve lagged behind Nvidia. Intel, grappling with factory delays and cost-cutting measures, is receiving government subsidies as part of its efforts to build chip factories. A Qualcomm takeover could enhance its portfolio by adding Intel’s dominance in PCs and servers to its smartphone chip business. Despite this potential merger, Intel continues to face major hurdles, including the possible need to split its design and manufacturing operations amid growing calls for the company to separate its business divisions.

Serious question from someone who took a four-year trading break.csv,Hey everyone After a long long hiatus and licking my wounds I decided to try trading once again. Recently I've been changing up my approach and doing 5-7 DTE spy options. And it's been going pretty decent however recently I got a couple of August 30th calls for Nvidia I managed to get in at a good position for 133 calls. My thesis is that it's going to keep pumping up to the day of earnings. I don't have any intention of holding the position up until expiration. My question is regarding theta decay and volatility. I know that the closer I got to the expiration the less profit I'll see as a percentage of my position. And I also understand that during high levels of volatility it can go both ways. And I'm not really asking for specific advice just kind of guidance or knowledge as to how that may affect my position. I'm holding them over the weekend and I'm expecting Monday to start off a little red but to finish off green and so I'm not quite sure if I want to sell half my positions and wait till earnings or if I should wait to earnings in general. I strongly believe that Nvidia is going to beat their earnings I just don't know how drastically that's going to affect the price action. Any and all input is definitely appreciated Thanks in advance,0.5421,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9936]"

Super Micro Falls as Hindenburg Takes Aim With Short Report.csv,"Super Micro Computer Inc.'s shares took a hit on Tuesday following a short report from Hindenburg Research that questioned the company's financial practices and transparency. Hindenburg's report alleged significant accounting red flags, undisclosed related-party transactions, and potential violations of sanctions and export controls. Initially, the report caused Super Micro's stock to plummet by as much as 8.7%, but it later rebounded to close down 2.6%. The server manufacturer has been a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, with its high-performance servers in high demand for data centers. This surge in AI-related demand has driven significant growth for the company, doubling its revenue to $14.9 billion in the most recent fiscal year. Despite a steep decline from its March peak, Super Micro's stock remains up over 90% for the year, reflecting continued investor interest in the burgeoning AI sector. However, the Hindenburg report could intensify scrutiny on Super Micro's accounting practices and client relationships, particularly as the company has faced regulatory challenges in the past. In 2020, Super Micro resolved a U.S. SEC investigation by correcting its financial statements and paying a penalty for accounting issues from 2014 to 2017. As the AI market continues to expand, maintaining investor confidence will be crucial for Super Micro, especially amid concerns about the profitability of AI-optimized servers and the potential for increased regulatory oversight.

Technical Analysis Lesson - Reversal Day in Nvidia (NVDA).csv,"Every trader wants to know when the trend is changing from up to down or down to up. This happens when the leadership in the market changes from bulls to bears or bears to bulls. These trend changes are what every trader looks for. If they can accurately predict market turns, they can profit. That’s why they do what they do. Sometimes this change of leadership is slow and takes a long period of time to happen. These changes have price action that tends to show up on a chart as a ‘Rounded Top’ or ‘Rounded Bottom’ pattern. Sometimes the reversal is abrupt and takes place over a few time periods. This action tends to show up on a chart as a ‘V’ or ‘Inverted V’ reversal. But sometimes the trend changes just in one day... These dynamics can show up on a chart as a ‘Reversal Day’ pattern. One may have just happened in the stock of Nivida (NVDA). The Western world would call it an ‘Outside Reversal Day’. In candlestick terminology, it is called a ‘Bearish Engulfing Pattern’. It’s important to note that these candlestick patterns are at least 700 years old. They were developed by Japanese rice traders. It shows that the human nature which is illustrated in charts hasn’t changed. The name doesn’t matter. The action that it illustrates does. On Friday morning, it looked as though the uptrend in NVDA was going to continue for yet another day. It opened at a higher price than Thursday’s close. But then the tide turned… Over the day, the sellers came out of the woodwork. And not only did they hold off the assault. They overpowered the buyers and eventually pushed the price much lower. Importantly, Friday’s closing price was lower than Thursday’s opening price. This is frequently a characteristic of a trend that is reversing. Sometimes the change of leadership from bulls to bears happens over an extended time-period. But sometimes it occurs in just one day. That could be the case here.",0.5201,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9938]"

Yes, China is a threat, but something tells me that China would not dare suffer the economic sanctions western nations would impose if they made a move in Taiwan.

TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand.csv,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

They are also mass producing 3nm chips which is starting to make up a nice chunk of their revenue. My main concern is obviously china but also that they are too tied to nvidia. Whenever i see them in the market, if NVIDIA is up 3%, they are up 6%, but if NVIDIA is down 3%, they are down 6-7%. Is it still a buy even though it has risen almost 50% this year?

Understand this about INTC.csv,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9999]"

It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation. I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors: Expense Ratio: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. Stock Selection Methodology: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. Performance Trends: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. Portfolio Diversification: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. Market Positioning: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. Innovative Approach of SoFi: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy. It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.

"Why Are Analysts Increasing NVIDIA’s Price Target Is It Out of Fear That Something Bad Will Happen, .csv","NVIDIA, often considered the heart of AI stocks, has recently been in the spotlight as analysts uniformly raise their stock targets. To me, this trend seems somewhat peculiar, even considering the current earnings season. The buoyant optimism surrounding the stock’s potential rise is sparking doubt in my mind. Should the stock underperform, it will be a litmus test of these analysts’ sincerity, raising questions about whether they may be manipulating public sentiment. In the broader context of the semiconductor sector, the recent quarterly earnings have been largely underwhelming. Yet, all semiconductor stocks appear to be buoyed by NVIDIA’s momentum. A stumble in NVIDIA’s stock could trigger a broader tech market downfall, while success could reignite a bullish trend for tech stocks. My intuition, however, leans towards a potential disappointment. NVIDIA might surpass current estimates but simultaneously lower their future guidance due to sluggish growth. Should this occur, a significant drop in stock price could follow. Disclaimer: These thoughts are purely my own observations and should not be taken as financial advice.",0.542,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9983]"

Worse case scenario the perfect Bear cocktail.csv,"After reading all the comments from my last post and doing some more thinking. I decided to entertain the idea of what would be the perfect Bear cocktail that could trigger a Stock Market destabilization. I'm not taking into account any type of positive news. I'm simply going the negative route, in a slow and systematic manner, without any huge trigger events. What am I missing and at what dates that's important and could also add to this? If you notice in the prior post list, three out of six times... rising interest rates were part of the cause that brought the market down at least 20%. Oil price shocks two out of 6. Then there´s speculative investments at the dotcom bubble. Covid, overvaluation, trade tensions... Stagflation. So these have to be in the mix one way or another: Cocktail Potential Ingredients: Rising interest rates. Oil price shocks. Speculative tech investments. Overvaluation. Trade tensions. Stagflation. New round of Covid-19. Housing or Commercial Real Estate Bubble. So this is the speculative worse case scenario we could have without going as far as having a WWIII: February 13, 2024: CPI report comes in hot. S&P500 comes down 1.5%, some buy the tiny dip. February 15, 2024: Jobless claims rise. Doesn't alter the market but adds to the cocktail mix. February 16, 2024: A higher-than-expected PPI indicates increasing costs at the producer level, which can signal rising inflationary pressures. Producers might pass these higher costs onto consumers, leading to an increase in consumer prices and overall inflation. The Fed to consider tightening monetary policy more aggressively than previously anticipated to combat inflation. This could include raising interest rates or adjusting the pace of tapering asset purchases. Financial markets don't react negatively to a higher-than-expected PPI, as it they priced it in from the CPI report. February 21, 2024: Nvidia posts earnings, they actually do fine but investors realize that´s gonna be the ceiling for now so the stock falls 15%. Other tech stocks get stained by the fear, bringing the S&P500 2.5% lower. AI investment sentiments leans towards potentially speculative for now.

AMD to acquire server builder ZT Systems for 49 billion in cash and stock.csv,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced on Monday its plans to acquire server manufacturer ZT Systems for $4.9 billion, as part of its strategy to bolster its portfolio of artificial intelligence (AI) chips and hardware, and to compete more effectively against Nvidia. The acquisition will be financed with 75% cash and the remaining in stock, leveraging AMD’s $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments reported in the second quarter. The rising demands of AI computing have necessitated the use of thousands of interconnected chips to achieve the required processing power, making the design and construction of server systems increasingly critical. This acquisition will enable AMD to enhance its capabilities in this area. According to AMD CEO Lisa Su, the addition of ZT Systems’ engineers will accelerate the company’s ability to test and deploy its latest AI GPUs on a scale required by major cloud computing companies like Microsoft. Although AMD plans to incorporate ZT Systems into its operations, it has no intention of competing directly in the server manufacturing market. Instead, the company plans to divest its server manufacturing business after the acquisition is finalized, with no discussions yet held with potential buyers. ZT Systems CEO Frank Zhang will join AMD, reporting to Forrest Norrod, AMD’s data center chief. The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2025, will see AMD retaining about 1,000 of ZT Systems' roughly 2,500 employees.

AMZN Earnings Preview- What to watch for tonight.csv,"Earnings from Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. will be crucial in guiding the Nasdaq 100 after a volatile period marked by extreme fluctuations. As the last megacaps to release results before Nvidia Corp. in August, these reports will set the tone for tech investors, particularly focusing on how artificial intelligence is driving growth in Amazon’s cloud-computing unit and boosting demand for Apple's next iPhone. The results will also provide valuable insights into the health of consumer spending, with Amazon shares already up about 25% this year. Amazon.com Inc. is set to release its Q2 earnings report after the market closes, with a conference call scheduled for 5:30 p.m. ET. Analysts project the company will report revenue of $148.8 billion, marking an 11% increase year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up from 65 cents in the same period last year. Amazon has guided for Q2 operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, signaling strong performance despite broader economic challenges. Key metrics expected by analysts include AWS revenue at nearly $26 billion, representing more than 17% year-over-year growth, and advertising revenue projected to reach $13 billion, a 21.7% increase from last year. The Stores segment, bolstered by events like Prime Day, is anticipated to show significant activity, while improvements in operating margins, especially in the North America segment, will be closely watched. Analysts also expect updates on AI initiatives and the overall capital expenditures for the year. Comments from analysts emphasize the importance of AI and cloud services for Amazon's future growth. Citi analysts, led by Ronald Josey, anticipate AWS revenue growth accelerated in Q2 due to generative AI tailwinds, while also predicting a beat in operating income thanks to improved retail efficiencies and strong advertising demand. Truist analyst Youssef Squali highlights Amazon's ability to gain share in global e-commerce and sees multiple growth vectors powering the company's continued expansion. Retail performance and consumer spending trends will be significant indicators, especially given mixed reports this earnings season. Analysts like Matt Stucky of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management note the importance of Amazon's retail margin expansion and its impact on profitability. Additionally, the potential for a surprise dividend announcement is a point of interest, as Amazon remains the last major tech company without a dividend program. Amazon's Q2 results will follow earnings reports from key competitors like Microsoft and Google, both of which had mixed receptions based on their cloud and AI performances. Wall Street's current focus is on tangible returns from AI investments, making Amazon's updates on its AI initiatives and AWS growth crucial for investor sentiment. The company's dominant position in the cloud market and ongoing efforts to enhance its e-commerce offerings will be under the microscope. Amazon saw its stock rise following a strong Q1 earnings report, showcasing impressive upside in both EPS and revenue. The standout metric was a significant 221% year-over-year increase in operating income to $15.31 billion, far surpassing the prior guidance of $8-12 billion. The company’s guidance for Q2 operating income of $10-14 billion also exceeded expectations. The Stores segment performed well, driven by successful shopping events like Amazon's Spring Deal Days in Europe and the first Big Spring Sale in Canada and the US. Faster delivery times, enhanced by regionalization efforts and cost-saving measures such as consolidating units into fewer boxes, boosted customer purchase frequency and overall spend. Additionally, Amazon is preparing for its 10th Prime Day event in July, which is expected to further drive sales. Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the highlight of the quarter, with a 17% growth in constant currency, an improvement from previous quarters. AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue business, with significant growth in both generative and non-generative AI workloads. The Advertising Services segment also showed robust growth, with a 24% increase in revenue to $11.82 billion, driven primarily by sponsored ads and early gains in Prime Video ads. Despite guiding Q2 revenue below consensus due to foreign exchange impacts, the strong performance in AWS and advertising has left investors optimistic.",0.5699,"['POSITIVE', 0.9923]"

Some of it just recovered from 2022 to it's pre-2022 state, but Nvidia has 205% growth this year, which is crazy Index funds - the legendary S&P 500. Everyone says it's the most stable etc - but I've found other indexes with even better growth. SP500 usually have the 7-10% yearly return and last 5 years went up 56%, but for example the INDEX Vanguard Growth ETF went up 87% for the last 5 years - and it was also a steady growth, not a lucky spike during one period. What do you think, is it really smart to go with SP500 or are there other ones that are much better, even tho SP500 is so hyped by everyone? and if you agree - what other indexes with better return would you recommend? Leverage - I'm not familiar with how much can you leverage in stocks, but for people that invest in the top 10, which most likely will go up in the future, wouldn't be smarter to invest it with i.e 5x leverage, since the companies like Microsoft are stable, and eventually will grow? Stock Math - let's say I invest $10.000 in a stock and it declines -50%. I know have $5.000. If it goes up by 50%, do I get $7.500 or do I get my $10.000 back?

Fundamentals behind a USA market drop this week & some positives.csv,"The problem areas in the USA: -------------------------- *- The Schiller PE is at a very high level. Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble. So stocks are highly expensive. *- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022! We are more of a service economy than a goods economy, *- World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle. That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local sales declines are offset. Additionally the trade war hampers both sides. *- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels. *- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers. You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term. People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank. However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials. AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth. AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales. So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia. This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW. I don't own any MKSI. This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording. So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN. Good areas: -------------------------------------- *- Labor productivity is up consistently since Q3 2022. one can see tradingeconomics dot com USA productivity *- Gasoline is lower than last year *- Retail sales are going fine, [ per a recent NPR radio article ] Nuetral ---------------------------------------- *- Labor force participation is not higher than Sept 2023. No more sales growth from people returning to work. Participation is up recently. tradingeconomics has this info. *- Consumer confidence is still down since January 2020.

This law used to mean that model performance would continue to increase with data and computation, but the scaling effect has now plateaued. Computing in the reasoning phase: To overcome pre-training bottlenecks, OpenAI and other labs are exploring “compute on test” techniques that enable human-like multi-step reasoning by allowing models to generate and evaluate multiple possibilities in real-time during the reasoning phase. This approach can be used more effectively for complex tasks such as mathematics and coding to optimize reasoning performance. Hardware Demand Shift: Market demand is likely to shift from large-scale pre-training clusters to inference clouds as new technologies reduce parameter requirements. This will weaken NVIDIA's monopoly in the training chip market, and the inference chip market may see more competition, especially as companies such as Groq may fill the new demand.

"Intel Aims For 1 Billion Software Revenue By 2027, According To CTO Greg Lavender.csv","Intel's Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Greg Lavender has stated that the company is making smooth progress in the software domain. By the end of 2027, the cumulative revenue from its software business could reach $1 billion. In 2021, Intel achieved over $100 million in software revenue. It was during this year that CEO Pat Gelsinger brought Lavender from cloud computing company VMware to guide the chipmaker's software strategy. Since then, Intel has acquired three software companies. I have a goal of getting to $1 billion of software and developer cloud subscription revenue, Lavender said, I think I'm on track to hit this goal by the end of 2027 ... maybe sooner.

Intel Corporation INTC’s Latest Strides and Challenges.csv,"Key Takeaways: Innovation and expansion in new tech frontiers are key growth drivers. Long-term outlook hinges on successful execution of strategic initiatives. Intel unveils new AI chip to compete with Nvidia and AMD Intel’s total revenue in Q3 2023 was $14.2 billion, marking an 8% decrease from Q3 2022. Company Overview: Intel Corporation, a global technology leader, has been at the forefront of innovation in the semiconductor industry. Founded in 1968, Intel’s contributions have been pivotal in the evolution of computing technologies. The company specializes in manufacturing microprocessors, chipsets, embedded processors, and network interface controllers, among others. Intel’s Strategic Pivot Amidst Market Flux Recent times have been a mix of challenges and opportunities for Intel. The company, once the undisputed leader in semiconductor technology, faces fierce competition from rivals like AMD and NVIDIA, who have made significant inroads into Intel’s market share. The rise of ARM-based processors and the increasing demand for specialized chips for AI and data centers add to the competitive pressure. Intel’s response to these challenges has been multi-pronged. The company has accelerated its innovation cycle, focusing on next-generation chip technologies. Under the leadership of CEO Pat Gelsinger, Intel announced a significant investment in expanding its manufacturing capabilities, aiming to not only meet its own chip demands but also offer foundry services to other chipmakers. Moreover, Intel is actively diversifying its product portfolio. Its recent advancements in AI, edge computing, and autonomous driving technologies signify a strategic shift.  Leading AI models, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, predominantly utilize Nvidia GPUs hosted in cloud environments. This reliance has contributed to Nvidia’s stock soaring by approximately 230% since the beginning of the year, in stark contrast to Intel’s 68% increase. This trend underlines why competitors like AMD and Intel are now introducing their own chips, aiming to challenge Nvidia’s strong market presence. Although specifics were sparse, Intel’s Gaudi3 is set to rival Nvidia’s H100, a popular choice for entities constructing extensive chip networks for AI operations, and AMD’s upcoming MI300X. The Gaudi3 is expected to begin distribution to clients in 2024. However, these strategic decisions come with their own set of risks. The high cost of chip manufacturing and R&D, coupled with the uncertain global economic landscape, poses significant challenges. The company’s ability to execute its ambitious plans while maintaining financial stability is a key factor to watch in the coming years. Recent Financials: Intel Corporation’s recent financial performance reflects the challenges and resilience of a tech giant in a volatile market. In Q3 2023, the company reported a total revenue of $14.2 billion, a decrease of 8% from the same quarter in the previous year. This decline was primarily due to decreases in revenue across its major segments: the Client Computing Group (CCG) revenue decreased by 3%, the Data Center and AI Group (DCAI) by 10%, and the Network and Edge Group (NEX) by a significant 32%. The company’s financial strategy also reflects a commitment to operational efficiency and cost management. By streamlining processes and optimizing resources, Intel aims to improve its profitability and shareholder value in the long term. This approach is crucial as the company faces intense competition from other tech giants and emerging players in the semiconductor industry. In conclusion, Intel’s recent financial performance, though marked by challenges, showcases the company’s strategic efforts to remain a dominant player in the tech industry. The company’s focus on innovation, operational efficiency, and market adaptability will be key to its future success and financial stability. Financial Bullet Points: Revenue (Q3 2023): $14.2 billion, down 8% YoY. Client Computing Group Revenue: Decreased by 3%. Data Center and AI Group Revenue: Decreased by 10%. Network and Edge Group Revenue: Decreased by 32%. Gross Margin (Q3 2023): 42.5%, slightly down from 42.6% YoY. Net Income (Q3 2023): $297 million, a substantial decline from $1.019 billion YoY. Earnings Per Share (Q3 2023): $0.07, with non-GAAP EPS at $0.41. Business Model & Competitors Analysis: Intel’s business model revolves around its dominance in CPUs, with expansion into data center solutions, IoT, and AI. The company’s shift towards providing foundry services marks a strategic expansion of its business scope. Competitors like AMD, NVIDIA, and ARM pose significant challenges. AMD’s gains in the CPU market and NVIDIA’s dominance in GPUs and AI chips have encroached on Intel’s turf. ARM’s energy-efficient architecture is increasingly favored for mobile devices and is making inroads into servers, a traditional Intel stronghold. Intel’s response lies in its comprehensive product range, manufacturing capabilities, and R&D investments. The company’s ability to innovate and adapt to market trends will be crucial in maintaining its competitive edge. SWOT Analysis: Strengths: Strong brand, diverse product portfolio, manufacturing capabilities. Weaknesses: Margin pressures, high competition, execution risks on strategic shifts. Opportunities: Growth in AI, autonomous tech, and data centers. Threats: Rapid technological changes, competitive market dynamics, global economic uncertainties. Investment Outlook: Intel’s future performance hinges on its ability to innovate and adapt to market trends. The company’s investment in AI and IoT, along with its strategic focus on foundry services, positions it well for future growth. After conducting a comprehensive 10-year forecast, our analysis indicates that Intel’s current valuation appears to be justifiable, taking into account a range of scenarios. These scenarios are grounded in conservative (low), moderate (mid), and optimistic (high) financial assumptions, providing a robust framework for evaluating the company’s long-term potential. Concluding Remarks: In conclusion, Intel Corporation stands at a pivotal point. Its strategic pivots, financial resilience, and commitment to innovation are commendable. Yet, the road ahead is fraught with challenges and competition. Intel’s journey will be a testament to its adaptability and resilience in an ever-evolving tech landscape. For investors, keeping a keen eye on Intel’s execution of its ambitious plans will be crucial in assessing its long-term potential in the dynamic semiconductor industry.",0.5575,"['POSITIVE', 0.9995]"

Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9443]"

Hi! I’m Dan Howley, the tech editor at Yahoo Finance, and Nvidia has seemingly been at the forefront of virtually everything I’ve covered since ChatGPT hit the scene in 2022. I’ve been covering the tech space for 13 years and tracking Nvidia for even longer. I built my first desktop PC with an Nvidia graphics card in high school and have continued using its products ever since. Now I, like everyone else, am focused on Nvidia’s AI efforts, from reporting on how they’re dealing with the threat of increased competition to attending the company’s GTC conference to chatting with CEO Jensen Huang alongside my colleague Julie Hyman. With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia’s chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like AMD are gaining steam, and Nvidia’s own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant. How that plays out over the next few years is anyone’s guess. In today’s fiscal 2025 third quarter earnings report, Nvidia beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines on the strength of sales of its high-powered AI chips. 💵 Revenue: $35.08B vs $33.2B expected 💲 Adjusted EPS: $0.81 vs $0.74 expected 💾 Data center revenue: $30.8B vs $29B expected Nvidia also said it anticipates revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, for the fiscal fourth quarter. That's just ahead of Wall Street expectations of $37 billion. I’ll be back tomorrow, Nov. 21, at 10 a.m. ET to answer your questions about Nvidia’s latest earnings, the market reaction, and where the stock goes from here. That does it for me for today.

Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&P 500 gains.csv,"= just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing = The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023 https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9 The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions. It’s an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve’s inflation battle, noted FactSet’s Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post. The 10 top performing days for the S&P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%. The S&P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday’s close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%. Through Dec. 22, the S&P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%. Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said. That didn’t mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote. Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found. Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July. The strategy “indicates the Fed’s measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,” Jakobsen said. The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks’ bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group’s announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering. SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a “mini” banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown. Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks — Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78% , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, 0.16%, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%, Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%, Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%, and Meta Platforms Inc. META, 0.56%. See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024? Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind. The S&P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted. In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high: The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&P 500’s weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted. Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&P 500’s overall return, he wrote, with the company’s success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.",0.5482,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9995]"
Mega-caps vs small caps.csv,"The current state of the stock market exhibits a stark contrast between the performance of mega-cap and small-cap stocks, as investors grapple with mixed signals from major corporations and broader market indices.  Recent developments have highlighted this divide, with Microsoft's upcoming earnings report set to further shape the narrative. Mega-Cap Weakness and Market Impact Microsoft, a key player in the technology sector, is set to report its earnings after the market close, and its performance could significantly influence investor sentiment.  The recent underperformance of large-cap stocks like Merck and Procter & Gamble, both of which have disappointed with earnings guidance, has contributed to the Nasdaq Composite's (-0.9%) and S&P 500's (-0.4%) downward pressure.  This weakness is reflected in the Vanguard Mega-Cap Growth ETF (MGK), which is down 1.1%. Small-Cap Resilience In contrast, small-cap stocks have shown relative strength, with the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 Value Index posting gains.  The equal-weighted S&P 500 is also holding its own, indicating that smaller companies are providing a stabilizing force in the market.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, buoyed by the financials and energy sectors, adds to this resilience. Sectors in Focus The IT sector, weighed down by NVIDIA's (-5.0%) decline ahead of AMD's earnings release, is leading the pack of losers.  Consumer staples, also negatively impacted, are lagging behind. On the other hand, financials, and energy sectors are posting gains, offering a glimmer of hope for investors seeking opportunities. Treasuries and Market Sentiment The Treasury market remains relatively calm, with the 2-yr note yield down to 4.38% and the 10-yr note yield at 4.17%.  Economic indicators, such as the better-than-expected consumer confidence index and the Bank of Japan's policy decision, have not sparked significant market movements, suggesting that investors are cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's FOMC decision on Wednesday. As we await Microsoft's earnings report, the stock market's divide between mega-cap and small-cap stocks is a cause for concern, especially for those relying on large-cap performance.  However, the resilience of small-cap companies and select sectors is providing a silver lining. Investors should stay vigilant, monitor market reactions to key earnings releases, and consider a diversified portfolio that takes into account the current market dynamics.  The Federal Reserve's decision will likely play a crucial role in determining the market's next course of action.",0.5419,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9136]"

MSFT faces long-term potential disadvantages.csv,"I think one of the main reasons Microsoft is a great long-term investment is its long history of generating a lot of free cash flow. At the time of writing, the company's free cash flow margin is over 30%, with free cash flow rising from $15.9 billion in 2009 to $74.1 billion in the last 12 months. This financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments. While Microsoft may not seem like a value investment, in my opinion, its pricing is reasonable given its continued revenue and earnings growth, and it's likely to continue for the foreseeable future. I estimate EPS growth of 13% on a regular basis over the next 12 months. Based on this projection, I have a price target of $482.40 and estimate that the stock will trade at a non-GAAP P/E ratio of around 36. Looking ahead, I expect Microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15% over the next 5 to 10 years. While this prospect necessitates buying the stock at a fair valuation, I believe the current price provides an opportunity. The company's forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is only 6.5% above its five-year average, while its forward diluted earnings per share growth rate is nearly the same at 5.8%. MSFT faces long-term potential headwinds One potential challenge to Microsoft's long-term growth in AI is that its adoption can be cyclical. Currently, the demand for AI systems is high, which has prompted Microsoft and other big tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion. However, when the current trend peaks (likely due to macroeconomic constraints), growth may slow. According to the TipRanks risk analysis tool, Microsoft is exposed to 32% risk from legal and regulatory factors, which is higher than the industry average and could impact its AI operations due to increased scrutiny of data privacy and AI governance. Given this outlook, I expect some volatility in Microsoft's long-term growth trajectory, although it may not be as good as NVIDIA NVDA -0.06% ▼ and so on semiconductor companies so obvious. As market sentiment fluctuates, cyclical price and valuation declines coincide with temporarily lower growth rates and may provide more attractive buying opportunities. There is also a risk that Microsoft and other Big Tech players could over-invest in AI infrastructure. With 21% of its risk related to Tech & Innovation, Microsoft’s heavy investment in AI-driven initiatives, including data center infrastructure, could result in lower-than-expected returns if industry growth does not meet expectations. This may impact free cash flow margins in the medium term, contributing to further volatility.",0.5607,"['NEGATIVE', 0.8794]"

Nvidia announces 50 billion stock buyback.csv,"Nvidia said Wednesday that its board of directors has approved a $50 billion stock buyback. The computer chip giant announced the share repurchase as part of its fiscal second-quarter earnings, in which it reported earnings and guidance that surpassed Wall Street expectations. Nvidia returned $15.4 billion to shareholders in share repurposes and cash dividends as part of the company’s first half of its fiscal 2025. The company said it had $7.5 billion remaining under its share repurchase plan, as of the end of its fiscal second quarter. Last year, Nvidia announced a $25 billion share buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results. Companies often experience a boom to their stock price after revealing stock buyback plans. In May, for instance, Apple announced a $110 billion stock buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results that showed overall sales fell 4% year over year and iPhone sales dropped 10% year over year. However, the iPhone maker’s shares rose 7% in after-hours trading, likely because Apple’s share buyback was the biggest in corporate history. With Nvidia’s shares dropping 4% in extended trading despite reporting solid financial results and announcing a stock buyback, some experts believe the company has been doing so well that it is getting harder to impress investors. Second-quarter sales rose 122% year over year to $30.04 billion, while net income jumped 168% year over year to $16.6 billion, Nvidia said.",0.6368,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9997]"

Nvidia More Room to Run Just Getting Started.csv,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they’ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don’t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical. Yes, Nvidia’s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn’t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now. Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn’t possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia’s place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn’t happened and Nvidia’s only gotten stronger. That’s not to say over time Nvidia won’t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it’s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution. Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations. I don’t think AI is a bubble but I do think that Nvidia and the market as a whole can get ahead of themselves.

"Nvidia reports earnings, Fed gathers in Jackson Hole What about this week.csv","In the final week of August, investors will be focused on two major events: Nvidia's earnings and the Federal Reserve's annual meeting in Jackson Hole. The Jackson Hole Economic Symposium will kick off on Thursday, with Fed Chair Jay Powell's address serving as the major event. Powell's comments on interest rates, the economy, and any indication that inflationary pressures are driving a reassessment of the Fed's present aims will be scrutinized. On the corporate front, Nvidia headlines the earnings story this week, with the chipmaker scheduled to publish data from a quarter that caused the chipmaker to increase its revenue forecast by 50%. Lowe's, BJ's Wholesale Club, and Peloton are also set to announce earnings this week. August is shaping up to be the worst month for stocks this year, with all three main averages closing last week lower after a hawkish read of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting sent equities lower and Treasury rates higher in the second half of the week. Economic data continues to come in stronger than expected, with the July retail sales report indicating a 0.7% increase in sales for the month, about double what economists forecast. The AtlantaFed's GDPNow projection now predicts third-quarter GDP growth of 5.8%, the strongest rate since the fourth quarter of 2021. Inflation has declined dramatically since Powell's Jackson Hole speech last year, when he predicted rates will climb until the ""job is done,"" lowering inflation. Powell has stated as recently as July that inflation is ""well above"" the Fed's long-run objective of 2%. On the corporate front, all eyes will be on Nvidia, which predicted that artificial intelligence demand will increase its current quarter sales projection from $7 billion to $11 billion. Nvidia stock is up about 200% year to date, but its gains have slowed along with the market since mid-July.

Looking further ahead, Oracle projects over $104 billion in revenue by fiscal 2029, along with a 20% year-over-year growth in earnings per share.

Qualcomm Approached Intel About a Takeover in Recent Days.csv,"Qualcomm recently approached Intel with a takeover proposal, marking what could be one of the largest tech deals in recent memory, according to sources. Intel, once valued at over $290 billion, has seen its market cap fall to around $90 billion after a challenging year in which its shares dropped 60%. While a deal is far from guaranteed, Qualcomm’s interest comes as Intel struggles to recover under CEO Pat Gelsinger’s turnaround plan, which has yet to deliver significant results. Should Intel be receptive, the deal could face heavy antitrust scrutiny, though some argue it might bolster U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor industry. Qualcomm may consider offloading parts of Intel to complete the acquisition. Both companies have sought to capitalize on the AI boom, though they’ve lagged behind Nvidia. Intel, grappling with factory delays and cost-cutting measures, is receiving government subsidies as part of its efforts to build chip factories. A Qualcomm takeover could enhance its portfolio by adding Intel’s dominance in PCs and servers to its smartphone chip business. Despite this potential merger, Intel continues to face major hurdles, including the possible need to split its design and manufacturing operations amid growing calls for the company to separate its business divisions.

Serious question from someone who took a four-year trading break.csv,Hey everyone After a long long hiatus and licking my wounds I decided to try trading once again. Recently I've been changing up my approach and doing 5-7 DTE spy options. And it's been going pretty decent however recently I got a couple of August 30th calls for Nvidia I managed to get in at a good position for 133 calls. My thesis is that it's going to keep pumping up to the day of earnings. I don't have any intention of holding the position up until expiration. My question is regarding theta decay and volatility. I know that the closer I got to the expiration the less profit I'll see as a percentage of my position. And I also understand that during high levels of volatility it can go both ways. And I'm not really asking for specific advice just kind of guidance or knowledge as to how that may affect my position. I'm holding them over the weekend and I'm expecting Monday to start off a little red but to finish off green and so I'm not quite sure if I want to sell half my positions and wait till earnings or if I should wait to earnings in general. I strongly believe that Nvidia is going to beat their earnings I just don't know how drastically that's going to affect the price action.

Super Micro Falls as Hindenburg Takes Aim With Short Report.csv,"Super Micro Computer Inc.'s shares took a hit on Tuesday following a short report from Hindenburg Research that questioned the company's financial practices and transparency. Hindenburg's report alleged significant accounting red flags, undisclosed related-party transactions, and potential violations of sanctions and export controls. Initially, the report caused Super Micro's stock to plummet by as much as 8.7%, but it later rebounded to close down 2.6%. The server manufacturer has been a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, with its high-performance servers in high demand for data centers. This surge in AI-related demand has driven significant growth for the company, doubling its revenue to $14.9 billion in the most recent fiscal year. Despite a steep decline from its March peak, Super Micro's stock remains up over 90% for the year, reflecting continued investor interest in the burgeoning AI sector. However, the Hindenburg report could intensify scrutiny on Super Micro's accounting practices and client relationships, particularly as the company has faced regulatory challenges in the past. In 2020, Super Micro resolved a U.S. SEC investigation by correcting its financial statements and paying a penalty for accounting issues from 2014 to 2017. As the AI market continues to expand, maintaining investor confidence will be crucial for Super Micro, especially amid concerns about the profitability of AI-optimized servers and the potential for increased regulatory oversight.

Technical Analysis Lesson - Reversal Day in Nvidia (NVDA).csv,"Every trader wants to know when the trend is changing from up to down or down to up. This happens when the leadership in the market changes from bulls to bears or bears to bulls. These trend changes are what every trader looks for. If they can accurately predict market turns, they can profit. That’s why they do what they do. Sometimes this change of leadership is slow and takes a long period of time to happen. These changes have price action that tends to show up on a chart as a ‘Rounded Top’ or ‘Rounded Bottom’ pattern. Sometimes the reversal is abrupt and takes place over a few time periods. This action tends to show up on a chart as a ‘V’ or ‘Inverted V’ reversal. But sometimes the trend changes just in one day... These dynamics can show up on a chart as a ‘Reversal Day’ pattern. One may have just happened in the stock of Nivida (NVDA). The Western world would call it an ‘Outside Reversal Day’. In candlestick terminology, it is called a ‘Bearish Engulfing Pattern’. It’s important to note that these candlestick patterns are at least 700 years old. They were developed by Japanese rice traders. It shows that the human nature which is illustrated in charts hasn’t changed. The name doesn’t matter. The action that it illustrates does. On Friday morning, it looked as though the uptrend in NVDA was going to continue for yet another day. It opened at a higher price than Thursday’s close. But then the tide turned… Over the day, the sellers came out of the woodwork. And not only did they hold off the assault. They overpowered the buyers and eventually pushed the price much lower. Importantly, Friday’s closing price was lower than Thursday’s opening price. This is frequently a characteristic of a trend that is reversing. Sometimes the change of leadership from bulls to bears happens over an extended time-period. But sometimes it occurs in just one day. That could be the case here.",0.5201,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9938]"

TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand.csv,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

Understand this about INTC.csv,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies.

VOO and chill but can you really not make smart moves.csv,"Hello, 21 year old here I understand some things have been proven over time, like ETFs boglehead philosophy etc. time in the market over timing the market but what about words like ""be greedy when others are fearful and be fearful when others are greedy?"" When you are young, let's say early 20s, this is the time to take risks isn't it? Every right risk you take now, compounds like crazy, every mistake? You are young you can still recover and learn. I'm not saying dump 100% like wallstreetbets gambling, but I'm talking about investing in stuff you believe in, despite the temporary bad financials or pr or being undervalued? For example, I am a software/hardware engineering student, and I was a gamer as a child. I knew a lot about companies like Intel, AMD, Nvidia etc. In college I knew Nvdia was gonna blow up because of CUDA and what not, AMD would blow intel out of the way, QCOM I was a fan of because I did some research on their chips. These are very entry level knowledge, but if it's enough for me to believe in working for these companies, isn't it enough to invest let's say 10%, 20%? Instead of dumping all into HYSA T bills and VTI/VOO VXUS etc and using 5% for individual picks? If shit goes down market goes down, I saw the covid crash happen infront of my eyes, I had 10k savings from my first internship, I could have bought these shares I believed so much in, but I didn't, it stayed in a HYSA. Sure you might not pick tesla before the run or nvidia, but you can pick amzn msft goog amd and if all these become bad picks and fail me then I don't think I should work for the tech industry right? If tech fails I fail because thats what I'm going into, and if I can risk my career for a job in such a ""volatile"" market then why can't I ""risk"" 30-50% of my portfolio in the same tier companies? Can someone experienced help me out with these thoughts? To me at this age it seems like VOO will get you the american dream comfortably, but VOO and good picks will make you rich, and if the market really fails dotcom and whatnot, you have to keep faith in the market and keep earning, some company will rise and if you are in the scene you will know about it, right?

Below is a table showing the top 10 holdings for each ETF along with their percentage weight in the respective ETFs. This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings: Data Sources: SPY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Schwab, Yahoo Finance. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST) SFY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Zacks.com, Yahoo Finance. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST) Key Observations: Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting. It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation. I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors: Expense Ratio: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. Stock Selection Methodology: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. Performance Trends: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. Portfolio Diversification: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. Market Positioning: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. Innovative Approach of SoFi: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy. It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.

"Why Are Analysts Increasing NVIDIA’s Price Target Is It Out of Fear That Something Bad Will Happen, .csv","NVIDIA, often considered the heart of AI stocks, has recently been in the spotlight as analysts uniformly raise their stock targets. To me, this trend seems somewhat peculiar, even considering the current earnings season. The buoyant optimism surrounding the stock’s potential rise is sparking doubt in my mind.

In the broader context of the semiconductor sector, the recent quarterly earnings have been largely underwhelming. Yet, all semiconductor stocks appear to be buoyed by NVIDIA’s momentum. A stumble in NVIDIA’s stock could trigger a broader tech market downfall, while success could reignite a bullish trend for tech stocks.

February 15, 2024: Jobless claims rise. Doesn't alter the market but adds to the cocktail mix. February 16, 2024: A higher-than-expected PPI indicates increasing costs at the producer level, which can signal rising inflationary pressures. Producers might pass these higher costs onto consumers, leading to an increase in consumer prices and overall inflation. The Fed to consider tightening monetary policy more aggressively than previously anticipated to combat inflation. This could include raising interest rates or adjusting the pace of tapering asset purchases. Financial markets don't react negatively to a higher-than-expected PPI, as it they priced it in from the CPI report.

Investors are focused on AMD’s ability to grow its AI business, with the company anticipating $4 billion in AI chip sales this year, accounting for 15% of its total expected sales. AMD’s core business in CPUs for laptops and servers and its growing AI chip segment position the company as a significant player in the evolving technology landscape.

AMD to acquire server builder ZT Systems for 49 billion in cash and stock.csv,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced on Monday its plans to acquire server manufacturer ZT Systems for $4.9 billion, as part of its strategy to bolster its portfolio of artificial intelligence (AI) chips and hardware, and to compete more effectively against Nvidia. The acquisition will be financed with 75% cash and the remaining in stock, leveraging AMD’s $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments reported in the second quarter. The rising demands of AI computing have necessitated the use of thousands of interconnected chips to achieve the required processing power, making the design and construction of server systems increasingly critical. This acquisition will enable AMD to enhance its capabilities in this area. According to AMD CEO Lisa Su, the addition of ZT Systems’ engineers will accelerate the company’s ability to test and deploy its latest AI GPUs on a scale required by major cloud computing companies like Microsoft. Although AMD plans to incorporate ZT Systems into its operations, it has no intention of competing directly in the server manufacturing market. Instead, the company plans to divest its server manufacturing business after the acquisition is finalized, with no discussions yet held with potential buyers. ZT Systems CEO Frank Zhang will join AMD, reporting to Forrest Norrod, AMD’s data center chief. The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2025, will see AMD retaining about 1,000 of ZT Systems' roughly 2,500 employees. AMD anticipates that the acquisition will positively impact its adjusted financial performance by the end of 2025.

AMZN Earnings Preview- What to watch for tonight.csv,"Earnings from Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. will be crucial in guiding the Nasdaq 100 after a volatile period marked by extreme fluctuations. As the last megacaps to release results before Nvidia Corp. in August, these reports will set the tone for tech investors, particularly focusing on how artificial intelligence is driving growth in Amazon’s cloud-computing unit and boosting demand for Apple's next iPhone. The results will also provide valuable insights into the health of consumer spending, with Amazon shares already up about 25% this year. Amazon.com Inc. is set to release its Q2 earnings report after the market closes, with a conference call scheduled for 5:30 p.m. ET. Analysts project the company will report revenue of $148.8 billion, marking an 11% increase year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up from 65 cents in the same period last year. Amazon has guided for Q2 operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, signaling strong performance despite broader economic challenges. Key metrics expected by analysts include AWS revenue at nearly $26 billion, representing more than 17% year-over-year growth, and advertising revenue projected to reach $13 billion, a 21.7% increase from last year. The Stores segment, bolstered by events like Prime Day, is anticipated to show significant activity, while improvements in operating margins, especially in the North America segment, will be closely watched. Analysts also expect updates on AI initiatives and the overall capital expenditures for the year. Comments from analysts emphasize the importance of AI and cloud services for Amazon's future growth. Citi analysts, led by Ronald Josey, anticipate AWS revenue growth accelerated in Q2 due to generative AI tailwinds, while also predicting a beat in operating income thanks to improved retail efficiencies and strong advertising demand. Truist analyst Youssef Squali highlights Amazon's ability to gain share in global e-commerce and sees multiple growth vectors powering the company's continued expansion. Retail performance and consumer spending trends will be significant indicators, especially given mixed reports this earnings season. Analysts like Matt Stucky of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management note the importance of Amazon's retail margin expansion and its impact on profitability. Additionally, the potential for a surprise dividend announcement is a point of interest, as Amazon remains the last major tech company without a dividend program. Amazon's Q2 results will follow earnings reports from key competitors like Microsoft and Google, both of which had mixed receptions based on their cloud and AI performances. Wall Street's current focus is on tangible returns from AI investments, making Amazon's updates on its AI initiatives and AWS growth crucial for investor sentiment. The company's dominant position in the cloud market and ongoing efforts to enhance its e-commerce offerings will be under the microscope. Amazon saw its stock rise following a strong Q1 earnings report, showcasing impressive upside in both EPS and revenue. The standout metric was a significant 221% year-over-year increase in operating income to $15.31 billion, far surpassing the prior guidance of $8-12 billion. The company’s guidance for Q2 operating income of $10-14 billion also exceeded expectations. The Stores segment performed well, driven by successful shopping events like Amazon's Spring Deal Days in Europe and the first Big Spring Sale in Canada and the US. Faster delivery times, enhanced by regionalization efforts and cost-saving measures such as consolidating units into fewer boxes, boosted customer purchase frequency and overall spend. Additionally, Amazon is preparing for its 10th Prime Day event in July, which is expected to further drive sales. Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the highlight of the quarter, with a 17% growth in constant currency, an improvement from previous quarters. AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue business, with significant growth in both generative and non-generative AI workloads. The Advertising Services segment also showed robust growth, with a 24% increase in revenue to $11.82 billion, driven primarily by sponsored ads and early gains in Prime Video ads. Despite guiding Q2 revenue below consensus due to foreign exchange impacts, the strong performance in AWS and advertising has left investors optimistic.",0.5699,"['POSITIVE', 0.9923]"

I'm wondering whether I should wait for it to drop, because most of the stock market is green this year, so I have a feeling it may drop since it grew so much, what do you think? Some of it just recovered from 2022 to it's pre-2022 state, but Nvidia has 205% growth this year, which is crazy Index funds - the legendary S&P 500. Everyone says it's the most stable etc - but I've found other indexes with even better growth. SP500 usually have the 7-10% yearly return and last 5 years went up 56%, but for example the INDEX Vanguard Growth ETF went up 87% for the last 5 years - and it was also a steady growth, not a lucky spike during one period. What do you think, is it really smart to go with SP500 or are there other ones that are much better, even tho SP500 is so hyped by everyone? and if you agree - what other indexes with better return would you recommend? Leverage - I'm not familiar with how much can you leverage in stocks, but for people that invest in the top 10, which most likely will go up in the future, wouldn't be smarter to invest it with i.e 5x leverage, since the companies like Microsoft are stable, and eventually will grow? Stock Math - let's say I invest $10.000 in a stock and it declines -50%. I know have $5.000. If it goes up by 50%, do I get $7.500 or do I get my $10.000 back? Logically the first answer, but something doesn't give me a peace of mind here, so I prefer to ask Eli Lilly - what do you think about this stock?

Fundamentals behind a USA market drop this week & some positives.csv,"The problem areas in the USA: -------------------------- *- The Schiller PE is at a very high level. Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble. So stocks are highly expensive. *- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022! We are more of a service economy than a goods economy, *- World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle. That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local sales declines are offset. Additionally the trade war hampers both sides. *- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels. *- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers. You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term. People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank. However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials. AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth. AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales. So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia. This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW. I don't own any MKSI. This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording. So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN. Good areas: -------------------------------------- *- Labor productivity is up consistently since Q3 2022. one can see tradingeconomics dot com USA productivity *- Gasoline is lower than last year *- Retail sales are going fine, [ per a recent NPR radio article ] Nuetral ---------------------------------------- *- Labor force participation is not higher than Sept 2023. No more sales growth from people returning to work. Participation is up recently. tradingeconomics has this info. *- Consumer confidence is still down since January 2020.

I'm new to Stock Market and I don't understand stock valuations.csv,"Hey! I'm really new to stock market and trading in general. I""m mainly a programmer and only a bystander in trading. In 2020, I realized (even with all the controversy they had) Nvidia was doing really good, they also had their investments in a lot of technologies finally start to pay off and even if you exclude the c rypt0 frenzy it was somewhat clear that Nvidia was nourishing. At least to me as a programmer, I thought they had a ton of technological dominance and advancements in various areas. And especially in 2022 when AI stuff popped up, if it wasn't clear before that with all the research and investments they were doing in AI/ML space, like it should be clear by that point with image generation, LLMs and OpenAI popping off and all of them relying on Nvidia. But the stock price was still at 15 USD at maximum in 2022. At that time I had literally 0 knowledge in the stock market and thought ""Maybe this is Nvidia's value and this value includes all the new things and market is aware of Nvidia."" but in hindsight Nvidia was overly undervalued and the market was simply not aware of it. Maybe it was clear to me because Nvidia is in my domain but am I missing something? For example, I also get the same vibes with Tesla. Yes it is crazily valued at the moment but still with the event they held yesterday and overall their direction, even if everyone hates Elon Musk, it also seems clear to me that Tesla will pack a lot more than what it currently is. The robotaxis, tesla robot, their battery techs, their knowledge in vision and ML and a lot more things will start to pay off eventually.

"Impacting NVDA is underlying logic,what does OpenAI is change in strategy mean.csv","Big model pre-training bottleneck: Silicon Valley AI labs are generally struggling with new model training, with OpenAI's Orion and Google's Gemini 2.0 failing to significantly outperform their predecessors, defying the “law of scaling”. This law used to mean that model performance would continue to increase with data and computation, but the scaling effect has now plateaued. Computing in the reasoning phase: To overcome pre-training bottlenecks, OpenAI and other labs are exploring “compute on test” techniques that enable human-like multi-step reasoning by allowing models to generate and evaluate multiple possibilities in real-time during the reasoning phase. This approach can be used more effectively for complex tasks such as mathematics and coding to optimize reasoning performance. Hardware Demand Shift: Market demand is likely to shift from large-scale pre-training clusters to inference clouds as new technologies reduce parameter requirements. This will weaken NVIDIA's monopoly in the training chip market, and the inference chip market may see more competition, especially as companies such as Groq may fill the new demand. Capital Trends: Venture capital organizations are highly concerned about this change, and are gradually investing more resources in distributed inference clouds to cater to the distributed server needs of inference computing.",0.5346,"['POSITIVE', 0.6048]"

Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9443]"

With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia’s chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like AMD are gaining steam, and Nvidia’s own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant.

Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&P 500 gains.csv,"= just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing = The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023 https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9 The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions. It’s an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve’s inflation battle, noted FactSet’s Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post. The 10 top performing days for the S&P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%. The S&P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday’s close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%. Through Dec. 22, the S&P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%. Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said. That didn’t mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote. Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found. Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July. The strategy “indicates the Fed’s measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,” Jakobsen said. The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks’ bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group’s announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering. SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a “mini” banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown. Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks — Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78% , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, 0.16%, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%, Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%, Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%, and Meta Platforms Inc. META, 0.56%. See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024? Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind. The S&P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted.

Mega-caps vs small caps.csv,"The current state of the stock market exhibits a stark contrast between the performance of mega-cap and small-cap stocks, as investors grapple with mixed signals from major corporations and broader market indices.  Recent developments have highlighted this divide, with Microsoft's upcoming earnings report set to further shape the narrative. Mega-Cap Weakness and Market Impact Microsoft, a key player in the technology sector, is set to report its earnings after the market close, and its performance could significantly influence investor sentiment.  The recent underperformance of large-cap stocks like Merck and Procter & Gamble, both of which have disappointed with earnings guidance, has contributed to the Nasdaq Composite's (-0.9%) and S&P 500's (-0.4%) downward pressure.  This weakness is reflected in the Vanguard Mega-Cap Growth ETF (MGK), which is down 1.1%. Small-Cap Resilience In contrast, small-cap stocks have shown relative strength, with the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 Value Index posting gains.  The equal-weighted S&P 500 is also holding its own, indicating that smaller companies are providing a stabilizing force in the market.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, buoyed by the financials and energy sectors, adds to this resilience. Sectors in Focus The IT sector, weighed down by NVIDIA's (-5.0%) decline ahead of AMD's earnings release, is leading the pack of losers.  Consumer staples, also negatively impacted, are lagging behind. On the other hand, financials, and energy sectors are posting gains, offering a glimmer of hope for investors seeking opportunities. Treasuries and Market Sentiment The Treasury market remains relatively calm, with the 2-yr note yield down to 4.38% and the 10-yr note yield at 4.17%.  Economic indicators, such as the better-than-expected consumer confidence index and the Bank of Japan's policy decision, have not sparked significant market movements, suggesting that investors are cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's FOMC decision on Wednesday. As we await Microsoft's earnings report, the stock market's divide between mega-cap and small-cap stocks is a cause for concern, especially for those relying on large-cap performance.  However, the resilience of small-cap companies and select sectors is providing a silver lining. Investors should stay vigilant, monitor market reactions to key earnings releases, and consider a diversified portfolio that takes into account the current market dynamics.  The Federal Reserve's decision will likely play a crucial role in determining the market's next course of action.",0.5419,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9136]"

MSFT faces long-term potential disadvantages.csv,"I think one of the main reasons Microsoft is a great long-term investment is its long history of generating a lot of free cash flow. At the time of writing, the company's free cash flow margin is over 30%, with free cash flow rising from $15.9 billion in 2009 to $74.1 billion in the last 12 months. This financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments. While Microsoft may not seem like a value investment, in my opinion, its pricing is reasonable given its continued revenue and earnings growth, and it's likely to continue for the foreseeable future. I estimate EPS growth of 13% on a regular basis over the next 12 months. Based on this projection, I have a price target of $482.40 and estimate that the stock will trade at a non-GAAP P/E ratio of around 36. Looking ahead, I expect Microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15% over the next 5 to 10 years. While this prospect necessitates buying the stock at a fair valuation, I believe the current price provides an opportunity. The company's forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is only 6.5% above its five-year average, while its forward diluted earnings per share growth rate is nearly the same at 5.8%. MSFT faces long-term potential headwinds One potential challenge to Microsoft's long-term growth in AI is that its adoption can be cyclical. Currently, the demand for AI systems is high, which has prompted Microsoft and other big tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion. However, when the current trend peaks (likely due to macroeconomic constraints), growth may slow. According to the TipRanks risk analysis tool, Microsoft is exposed to 32% risk from legal and regulatory factors, which is higher than the industry average and could impact its AI operations due to increased scrutiny of data privacy and AI governance. Given this outlook, I expect some volatility in Microsoft's long-term growth trajectory, although it may not be as good as NVIDIA NVDA -0.06% ▼ and so on semiconductor companies so obvious. As market sentiment fluctuates, cyclical price and valuation declines coincide with temporarily lower growth rates and may provide more attractive buying opportunities. There is also a risk that Microsoft and other Big Tech players could over-invest in AI infrastructure. With 21% of its risk related to Tech & Innovation, Microsoft’s heavy investment in AI-driven initiatives, including data center infrastructure, could result in lower-than-expected returns if industry growth does not meet expectations. This may impact free cash flow margins in the medium term, contributing to further volatility.",0.5607,"['NEGATIVE', 0.8794]"

The company said it had $7.5 billion remaining under its share repurchase plan, as of the end of its fiscal second quarter.

Nvidia More Room to Run Just Getting Started.csv,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they’ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don’t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical. Yes, Nvidia’s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn’t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now.

That’s not to say over time Nvidia won’t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it’s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution. Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations.

While a deal is far from guaranteed, Qualcomm’s interest comes as Intel struggles to recover under CEO Pat Gelsinger’s turnaround plan, which has yet to deliver significant results. Should Intel be receptive, the deal could face heavy antitrust scrutiny, though some argue it might bolster U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor industry.

RYCEY do you believe in this company.csv,"Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC (LSE:RR.) shares have risen three-fold in little more than a year, but there is still a bit more to go according to Citigroup, which has raised its share price target to 555p. “Positive sentiment will help the continued rerating, driven by accelerating wide body cycle (only a few delivery slots before 2030 for the A350 and 2028 for the A330),” said the bank.

Not exactly surprising to see these giants at the top of the list. The year is 2044... does the top eight look relatively similar to what it looks like now? Feels hard to argue otherwise.

Serious question from someone who took a four-year trading break.csv,Hey everyone After a long long hiatus and licking my wounds I decided to try trading once again. Recently I've been changing up my approach and doing 5-7 DTE spy options. And it's been going pretty decent however recently I got a couple of August 30th calls for Nvidia I managed to get in at a good position for 133 calls. My thesis is that it's going to keep pumping up to the day of earnings. I don't have any intention of holding the position up until expiration. My question is regarding theta decay and volatility. I know that the closer I got to the expiration the less profit I'll see as a percentage of my position. And I also understand that during high levels of volatility it can go both ways. And I'm not really asking for specific advice just kind of guidance or knowledge as to how that may affect my position. I'm holding them over the weekend and I'm expecting Monday to start off a little red but to finish off green and so I'm not quite sure if I want to sell half my positions and wait till earnings or if I should wait to earnings in general. I strongly believe that Nvidia is going to beat their earnings I just don't know how drastically that's going to affect the price action. Any and all input is definitely appreciated Thanks in advance,0.5421,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9936]"

Super Micro Falls as Hindenburg Takes Aim With Short Report.csv,"Super Micro Computer Inc.'s shares took a hit on Tuesday following a short report from Hindenburg Research that questioned the company's financial practices and transparency. Hindenburg's report alleged significant accounting red flags, undisclosed related-party transactions, and potential violations of sanctions and export controls. Initially, the report caused Super Micro's stock to plummet by as much as 8.7%, but it later rebounded to close down 2.6%. The server manufacturer has been a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, with its high-performance servers in high demand for data centers. This surge in AI-related demand has driven significant growth for the company, doubling its revenue to $14.9 billion in the most recent fiscal year. Despite a steep decline from its March peak, Super Micro's stock remains up over 90% for the year, reflecting continued investor interest in the burgeoning AI sector. However, the Hindenburg report could intensify scrutiny on Super Micro's accounting practices and client relationships, particularly as the company has faced regulatory challenges in the past. In 2020, Super Micro resolved a U.S. SEC investigation by correcting its financial statements and paying a penalty for accounting issues from 2014 to 2017. As the AI market continues to expand, maintaining investor confidence will be crucial for Super Micro, especially amid concerns about the profitability of AI-optimized servers and the potential for increased regulatory oversight.

Technical Analysis Lesson - Reversal Day in Nvidia (NVDA).csv,"Every trader wants to know when the trend is changing from up to down or down to up. This happens when the leadership in the market changes from bulls to bears or bears to bulls. These trend changes are what every trader looks for. If they can accurately predict market turns, they can profit. That’s why they do what they do. Sometimes this change of leadership is slow and takes a long period of time to happen. These changes have price action that tends to show up on a chart as a ‘Rounded Top’ or ‘Rounded Bottom’ pattern. Sometimes the reversal is abrupt and takes place over a few time periods. This action tends to show up on a chart as a ‘V’ or ‘Inverted V’ reversal. But sometimes the trend changes just in one day... These dynamics can show up on a chart as a ‘Reversal Day’ pattern. One may have just happened in the stock of Nivida (NVDA). The Western world would call it an ‘Outside Reversal Day’. In candlestick terminology, it is called a ‘Bearish Engulfing Pattern’. It’s important to note that these candlestick patterns are at least 700 years old. They were developed by Japanese rice traders. It shows that the human nature which is illustrated in charts hasn’t changed. The name doesn’t matter. The action that it illustrates does. On Friday morning, it looked as though the uptrend in NVDA was going to continue for yet another day. It opened at a higher price than Thursday’s close. But then the tide turned… Over the day, the sellers came out of the woodwork. And not only did they hold off the assault. They overpowered the buyers and eventually pushed the price much lower. Importantly, Friday’s closing price was lower than Thursday’s opening price. This is frequently a characteristic of a trend that is reversing. Sometimes the change of leadership from bulls to bears happens over an extended time-period. But sometimes it occurs in just one day. That could be the case here.",0.5201,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9938]"

TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand.csv,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

They are also mass producing 3nm chips which is starting to make up a nice chunk of their revenue. My main concern is obviously china but also that they are too tied to nvidia. Whenever i see them in the market, if NVIDIA is up 3%, they are up 6%, but if NVIDIA is down 3%, they are down 6-7%. Is it still a buy even though it has risen almost 50% this year?

Understand this about INTC.csv,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9999]"

This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings: Data Sources: SPY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Schwab, Yahoo Finance. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST) SFY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Zacks.com, Yahoo Finance. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST) Key Observations: Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting. It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation. I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors: Expense Ratio: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. Stock Selection Methodology: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. Performance Trends: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. Portfolio Diversification: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. Market Positioning: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. Innovative Approach of SoFi: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy.

"Why Are Analysts Increasing NVIDIA’s Price Target Is It Out of Fear That Something Bad Will Happen, .csv","NVIDIA, often considered the heart of AI stocks, has recently been in the spotlight as analysts uniformly raise their stock targets.

AMD to acquire server builder ZT Systems for 49 billion in cash and stock.csv,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced on Monday its plans to acquire server manufacturer ZT Systems for $4.9 billion, as part of its strategy to bolster its portfolio of artificial intelligence (AI) chips and hardware, and to compete more effectively against Nvidia. The acquisition will be financed with 75% cash and the remaining in stock, leveraging AMD’s $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments reported in the second quarter. The rising demands of AI computing have necessitated the use of thousands of interconnected chips to achieve the required processing power, making the design and construction of server systems increasingly critical. This acquisition will enable AMD to enhance its capabilities in this area. According to AMD CEO Lisa Su, the addition of ZT Systems’ engineers will accelerate the company’s ability to test and deploy its latest AI GPUs on a scale required by major cloud computing companies like Microsoft. Although AMD plans to incorporate ZT Systems into its operations, it has no intention of competing directly in the server manufacturing market. Instead, the company plans to divest its server manufacturing business after the acquisition is finalized, with no discussions yet held with potential buyers. ZT Systems CEO Frank Zhang will join AMD, reporting to Forrest Norrod, AMD’s data center chief. The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2025, will see AMD retaining about 1,000 of ZT Systems' roughly 2,500 employees.

AMZN Earnings Preview- What to watch for tonight.csv,"Earnings from Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. will be crucial in guiding the Nasdaq 100 after a volatile period marked by extreme fluctuations. As the last megacaps to release results before Nvidia Corp. in August, these reports will set the tone for tech investors, particularly focusing on how artificial intelligence is driving growth in Amazon’s cloud-computing unit and boosting demand for Apple's next iPhone. The results will also provide valuable insights into the health of consumer spending, with Amazon shares already up about 25% this year. Amazon.com Inc. is set to release its Q2 earnings report after the market closes, with a conference call scheduled for 5:30 p.m. ET. Analysts project the company will report revenue of $148.8 billion, marking an 11% increase year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up from 65 cents in the same period last year. Amazon has guided for Q2 operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, signaling strong performance despite broader economic challenges. Key metrics expected by analysts include AWS revenue at nearly $26 billion, representing more than 17% year-over-year growth, and advertising revenue projected to reach $13 billion, a 21.7% increase from last year. The Stores segment, bolstered by events like Prime Day, is anticipated to show significant activity, while improvements in operating margins, especially in the North America segment, will be closely watched. Analysts also expect updates on AI initiatives and the overall capital expenditures for the year. Comments from analysts emphasize the importance of AI and cloud services for Amazon's future growth. Citi analysts, led by Ronald Josey, anticipate AWS revenue growth accelerated in Q2 due to generative AI tailwinds, while also predicting a beat in operating income thanks to improved retail efficiencies and strong advertising demand. Truist analyst Youssef Squali highlights Amazon's ability to gain share in global e-commerce and sees multiple growth vectors powering the company's continued expansion. Retail performance and consumer spending trends will be significant indicators, especially given mixed reports this earnings season. Analysts like Matt Stucky of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management note the importance of Amazon's retail margin expansion and its impact on profitability. Additionally, the potential for a surprise dividend announcement is a point of interest, as Amazon remains the last major tech company without a dividend program. Amazon's Q2 results will follow earnings reports from key competitors like Microsoft and Google, both of which had mixed receptions based on their cloud and AI performances. Wall Street's current focus is on tangible returns from AI investments, making Amazon's updates on its AI initiatives and AWS growth crucial for investor sentiment. The company's dominant position in the cloud market and ongoing efforts to enhance its e-commerce offerings will be under the microscope. Amazon saw its stock rise following a strong Q1 earnings report, showcasing impressive upside in both EPS and revenue. The standout metric was a significant 221% year-over-year increase in operating income to $15.31 billion, far surpassing the prior guidance of $8-12 billion. The company’s guidance for Q2 operating income of $10-14 billion also exceeded expectations. The Stores segment performed well, driven by successful shopping events like Amazon's Spring Deal Days in Europe and the first Big Spring Sale in Canada and the US. Faster delivery times, enhanced by regionalization efforts and cost-saving measures such as consolidating units into fewer boxes, boosted customer purchase frequency and overall spend. Additionally, Amazon is preparing for its 10th Prime Day event in July, which is expected to further drive sales. Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the highlight of the quarter, with a 17% growth in constant currency, an improvement from previous quarters. AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue business, with significant growth in both generative and non-generative AI workloads. The Advertising Services segment also showed robust growth, with a 24% increase in revenue to $11.82 billion, driven primarily by sponsored ads and early gains in Prime Video ads. Despite guiding Q2 revenue below consensus due to foreign exchange impacts, the strong performance in AWS and advertising has left investors optimistic.",0.5699,"['POSITIVE', 0.9923]"

Everyone says it's the most stable etc - but I've found other indexes with even better growth. SP500 usually have the 7-10% yearly return and last 5 years went up 56%, but for example the INDEX Vanguard Growth ETF went up 87% for the last 5 years - and it was also a steady growth, not a lucky spike during one period. What do you think, is it really smart to go with SP500 or are there other ones that are much better, even tho SP500 is so hyped by everyone? and if you agree - what other indexes with better return would you recommend? Leverage - I'm not familiar with how much can you leverage in stocks, but for people that invest in the top 10, which most likely will go up in the future, wouldn't be smarter to invest it with i.e 5x leverage, since the companies like Microsoft are stable, and eventually will grow?

Dell Earnings.csv,"I wanted to get everyone’s take on DELL (down nearly 11% after hours.) I bought 106 shares at 130.5 during their recent run. Didn’t sell today because I like their growth prospects wanted to exit around $150. The company seems solid, especially with its strength in enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure, even though consumer PC sales have been an ongoing problem. Despite this Dell has been doubling down on AI, data centers, and hybrid cloud, which I believe should set them up well for growth in 2025. They also stand to benefit from SMCI’s issues and Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure. With the growing focus on AI and enterprise tech, it feels like Dell could see steady, long-term growth and break out to that $150 range by Q2 2024. Thoughts? Should I continue to hold?

Fundamentals behind a USA market drop this week & some positives.csv,"The problem areas in the USA: -------------------------- *- The Schiller PE is at a very high level. Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble. So stocks are highly expensive. *- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022! We are more of a service economy than a goods economy, *- World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle. That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local sales declines are offset. Additionally the trade war hampers both sides. *- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels. *- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers. You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term. People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank. However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials. AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth. AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales. So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia. This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW. I don't own any MKSI. This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording. So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN. Good areas: -------------------------------------- *- Labor productivity is up consistently since Q3 2022. one can see tradingeconomics dot com USA productivity *- Gasoline is lower than last year *- Retail sales are going fine, [ per a recent NPR radio article ] Nuetral ---------------------------------------- *- Labor force participation is not higher than Sept 2023. No more sales growth from people returning to work. Participation is up recently. tradingeconomics has this info. *- Consumer confidence is still down since January 2020.

Liz Ann Sonders, Chief Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab, pointed out that beneath the surface, the average stock in the Nasdaq has experienced a 37% drawdown, compared to the 7% maximum drawdown of the index from its year-to-date high.

This law used to mean that model performance would continue to increase with data and computation, but the scaling effect has now plateaued. Computing in the reasoning phase: To overcome pre-training bottlenecks, OpenAI and other labs are exploring “compute on test” techniques that enable human-like multi-step reasoning by allowing models to generate and evaluate multiple possibilities in real-time during the reasoning phase. This approach can be used more effectively for complex tasks such as mathematics and coding to optimize reasoning performance. Hardware Demand Shift: Market demand is likely to shift from large-scale pre-training clusters to inference clouds as new technologies reduce parameter requirements. This will weaken NVIDIA's monopoly in the training chip market, and the inference chip market may see more competition, especially as companies such as Groq may fill the new demand.

The high cost of chip manufacturing and R&D, coupled with the uncertain global economic landscape, poses significant challenges. The company’s ability to execute its ambitious plans while maintaining financial stability is a key factor to watch in the coming years. Recent Financials: Intel Corporation’s recent financial performance reflects the challenges and resilience of a tech giant in a volatile market. In Q3 2023, the company reported a total revenue of $14.2 billion, a decrease of 8% from the same quarter in the previous year. This decline was primarily due to decreases in revenue across its major segments: the Client Computing Group (CCG) revenue decreased by 3%, the Data Center and AI Group (DCAI) by 10%, and the Network and Edge Group (NEX) by a significant 32%. The company’s financial strategy also reflects a commitment to operational efficiency and cost management. By streamlining processes and optimizing resources, Intel aims to improve its profitability and shareholder value in the long term. This approach is crucial as the company faces intense competition from other tech giants and emerging players in the semiconductor industry. In conclusion, Intel’s recent financial performance, though marked by challenges, showcases the company’s strategic efforts to remain a dominant player in the tech industry. The company’s focus on innovation, operational efficiency, and market adaptability will be key to its future success and financial stability.

Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9443]"

Hi! I’m Dan Howley, the tech editor at Yahoo Finance, and Nvidia has seemingly been at the forefront of virtually everything I’ve covered since ChatGPT hit the scene in 2022. I’ve been covering the tech space for 13 years and tracking Nvidia for even longer. I built my first desktop PC with an Nvidia graphics card in high school and have continued using its products ever since. Now I, like everyone else, am focused on Nvidia’s AI efforts, from reporting on how they’re dealing with the threat of increased competition to attending the company’s GTC conference to chatting with CEO Jensen Huang alongside my colleague Julie Hyman. With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia’s chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like AMD are gaining steam, and Nvidia’s own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant. How that plays out over the next few years is anyone’s guess. In today’s fiscal 2025 third quarter earnings report, Nvidia beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines on the strength of sales of its high-powered AI chips. 💵 Revenue: $35.08B vs $33.2B expected 💲 Adjusted EPS: $0.81 vs $0.74 expected 💾 Data center revenue: $30.8B vs $29B expected Nvidia also said it anticipates revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, for the fiscal fourth quarter. That's just ahead of Wall Street expectations of $37 billion. I’ll be back tomorrow, Nov. 21, at 10 a.m. ET to answer your questions about Nvidia’s latest earnings, the market reaction, and where the stock goes from here. That does it for me for today.

Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&P 500 gains.csv,"= just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing = The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023 https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9 The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions. It’s an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve’s inflation battle, noted FactSet’s Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post. The 10 top performing days for the S&P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%. The S&P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday’s close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%. Through Dec. 22, the S&P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%. Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said. That didn’t mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote. Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found. Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July. The strategy “indicates the Fed’s measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,” Jakobsen said. The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks’ bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group’s announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering. SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a “mini” banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown. Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks — Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78% , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, 0.16%, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%, Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%, Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%, and Meta Platforms Inc. META, 0.56%. See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024? Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind. The S&P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted. In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high: The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&P 500’s weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted. Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&P 500’s overall return, he wrote, with the company’s success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.",0.5482,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9995]"
Mega-caps vs small caps.csv,"The current state of the stock market exhibits a stark contrast between the performance of mega-cap and small-cap stocks, as investors grapple with mixed signals from major corporations and broader market indices.  Recent developments have highlighted this divide, with Microsoft's upcoming earnings report set to further shape the narrative. Mega-Cap Weakness and Market Impact Microsoft, a key player in the technology sector, is set to report its earnings after the market close, and its performance could significantly influence investor sentiment.  The recent underperformance of large-cap stocks like Merck and Procter & Gamble, both of which have disappointed with earnings guidance, has contributed to the Nasdaq Composite's (-0.9%) and S&P 500's (-0.4%) downward pressure.  This weakness is reflected in the Vanguard Mega-Cap Growth ETF (MGK), which is down 1.1%. Small-Cap Resilience In contrast, small-cap stocks have shown relative strength, with the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 Value Index posting gains.  The equal-weighted S&P 500 is also holding its own, indicating that smaller companies are providing a stabilizing force in the market.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, buoyed by the financials and energy sectors, adds to this resilience. Sectors in Focus The IT sector, weighed down by NVIDIA's (-5.0%) decline ahead of AMD's earnings release, is leading the pack of losers.  Consumer staples, also negatively impacted, are lagging behind. On the other hand, financials, and energy sectors are posting gains, offering a glimmer of hope for investors seeking opportunities. Treasuries and Market Sentiment The Treasury market remains relatively calm, with the 2-yr note yield down to 4.38% and the 10-yr note yield at 4.17%.  Economic indicators, such as the better-than-expected consumer confidence index and the Bank of Japan's policy decision, have not sparked significant market movements, suggesting that investors are cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's FOMC decision on Wednesday. As we await Microsoft's earnings report, the stock market's divide between mega-cap and small-cap stocks is a cause for concern, especially for those relying on large-cap performance.  However, the resilience of small-cap companies and select sectors is providing a silver lining. Investors should stay vigilant, monitor market reactions to key earnings releases, and consider a diversified portfolio that takes into account the current market dynamics.  The Federal Reserve's decision will likely play a crucial role in determining the market's next course of action.",0.5419,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9136]"

MSFT faces long-term potential disadvantages.csv,"I think one of the main reasons Microsoft is a great long-term investment is its long history of generating a lot of free cash flow. At the time of writing, the company's free cash flow margin is over 30%, with free cash flow rising from $15.9 billion in 2009 to $74.1 billion in the last 12 months. This financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments. While Microsoft may not seem like a value investment, in my opinion, its pricing is reasonable given its continued revenue and earnings growth, and it's likely to continue for the foreseeable future. I estimate EPS growth of 13% on a regular basis over the next 12 months. Based on this projection, I have a price target of $482.40 and estimate that the stock will trade at a non-GAAP P/E ratio of around 36. Looking ahead, I expect Microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15% over the next 5 to 10 years. While this prospect necessitates buying the stock at a fair valuation, I believe the current price provides an opportunity. The company's forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is only 6.5% above its five-year average, while its forward diluted earnings per share growth rate is nearly the same at 5.8%. MSFT faces long-term potential headwinds One potential challenge to Microsoft's long-term growth in AI is that its adoption can be cyclical. Currently, the demand for AI systems is high, which has prompted Microsoft and other big tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion. However, when the current trend peaks (likely due to macroeconomic constraints), growth may slow. According to the TipRanks risk analysis tool, Microsoft is exposed to 32% risk from legal and regulatory factors, which is higher than the industry average and could impact its AI operations due to increased scrutiny of data privacy and AI governance. Given this outlook, I expect some volatility in Microsoft's long-term growth trajectory, although it may not be as good as NVIDIA NVDA -0.06% ▼ and so on semiconductor companies so obvious. As market sentiment fluctuates, cyclical price and valuation declines coincide with temporarily lower growth rates and may provide more attractive buying opportunities. There is also a risk that Microsoft and other Big Tech players could over-invest in AI infrastructure. With 21% of its risk related to Tech & Innovation, Microsoft’s heavy investment in AI-driven initiatives, including data center infrastructure, could result in lower-than-expected returns if industry growth does not meet expectations. This may impact free cash flow margins in the medium term, contributing to further volatility.",0.5607,"['NEGATIVE', 0.8794]"

For reference, my next potential entries will depend on developments in the bigger-picture macro sentiment toward artificial intelligence & microchip industries, but for now, are as follows: entry #1 is around $445, entry #2 is around $410, and entry #3 around $375. Was thinking I would add 1 or 2 shares at entry 1, and then larger numbers of shares if price action takes us down to the other 2 circled areas.

Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is on a path to exceed its earnings expectations next month when its Q3 report comes out. While an earnings beat is not fully guaranteed, the latest earnings results of the company’s peers, suppliers, clients, and businesses that have a connection to the generative AI industry point to Nvidia having a stellar performance in Q3. The demand for its AI GPUs remains high, the company has been receiving upward revisions recently, and its stock is trading around its all-time high levels with a potential to appreciate even further in the upcoming months.

Nvidia announces 50 billion stock buyback.csv,"Nvidia said Wednesday that its board of directors has approved a $50 billion stock buyback. The computer chip giant announced the share repurchase as part of its fiscal second-quarter earnings, in which it reported earnings and guidance that surpassed Wall Street expectations. Nvidia returned $15.4 billion to shareholders in share repurposes and cash dividends as part of the company’s first half of its fiscal 2025. The company said it had $7.5 billion remaining under its share repurchase plan, as of the end of its fiscal second quarter. Last year, Nvidia announced a $25 billion share buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results. Companies often experience a boom to their stock price after revealing stock buyback plans. In May, for instance, Apple announced a $110 billion stock buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results that showed overall sales fell 4% year over year and iPhone sales dropped 10% year over year. However, the iPhone maker’s shares rose 7% in after-hours trading, likely because Apple’s share buyback was the biggest in corporate history. With Nvidia’s shares dropping 4% in extended trading despite reporting solid financial results and announcing a stock buyback, some experts believe the company has been doing so well that it is getting harder to impress investors.

Nvidia More Room to Run Just Getting Started.csv,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they’ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don’t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical. Yes, Nvidia’s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn’t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now. Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn’t possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia’s place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn’t happened and Nvidia’s only gotten stronger. That’s not to say over time Nvidia won’t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it’s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution. Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations.

"Nvidia reports earnings, Fed gathers in Jackson Hole What about this week.csv","In the final week of August, investors will be focused on two major events: Nvidia's earnings and the Federal Reserve's annual meeting in Jackson Hole.

Powell's comments on interest rates, the economy, and any indication that inflationary pressures are driving a reassessment of the Fed's present aims will be scrutinized. On the corporate front, Nvidia headlines the earnings story this week, with the chipmaker scheduled to publish data from a quarter that caused the chipmaker to increase its revenue forecast by 50%. Lowe's, BJ's Wholesale Club, and Peloton are also set to announce earnings this week. August is shaping up to be the worst month for stocks this year, with all three main averages closing last week lower after a hawkish read of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting sent equities lower and Treasury rates higher in the second half of the week. Economic data continues to come in stronger than expected, with the July retail sales report indicating a 0.7% increase in sales for the month, about double what economists forecast. The AtlantaFed's GDPNow projection now predicts third-quarter GDP growth of 5.8%, the strongest rate since the fourth quarter of 2021. Inflation has declined dramatically since Powell's Jackson Hole speech last year, when he predicted rates will climb until the ""job is done,"" lowering inflation. Powell has stated as recently as July that inflation is ""well above"" the Fed's long-run objective of 2%. On the corporate front, all eyes will be on Nvidia, which predicted that artificial intelligence demand will increase its current quarter sales projection from $7 billion to $11 billion.

Qualcomm Approached Intel About a Takeover in Recent Days.csv,"Qualcomm recently approached Intel with a takeover proposal, marking what could be one of the largest tech deals in recent memory, according to sources. Intel, once valued at over $290 billion, has seen its market cap fall to around $90 billion after a challenging year in which its shares dropped 60%. While a deal is far from guaranteed, Qualcomm’s interest comes as Intel struggles to recover under CEO Pat Gelsinger’s turnaround plan, which has yet to deliver significant results. Should Intel be receptive, the deal could face heavy antitrust scrutiny, though some argue it might bolster U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor industry. Qualcomm may consider offloading parts of Intel to complete the acquisition. Both companies have sought to capitalize on the AI boom, though they’ve lagged behind Nvidia. Intel, grappling with factory delays and cost-cutting measures, is receiving government subsidies as part of its efforts to build chip factories. A Qualcomm takeover could enhance its portfolio by adding Intel’s dominance in PCs and servers to its smartphone chip business.

Serious question from someone who took a four-year trading break.csv,Hey everyone After a long long hiatus and licking my wounds I decided to try trading once again. Recently I've been changing up my approach and doing 5-7 DTE spy options. And it's been going pretty decent however recently I got a couple of August 30th calls for Nvidia I managed to get in at a good position for 133 calls. My thesis is that it's going to keep pumping up to the day of earnings. I don't have any intention of holding the position up until expiration. My question is regarding theta decay and volatility. I know that the closer I got to the expiration the less profit I'll see as a percentage of my position. And I also understand that during high levels of volatility it can go both ways. And I'm not really asking for specific advice just kind of guidance or knowledge as to how that may affect my position. I'm holding them over the weekend and I'm expecting Monday to start off a little red but to finish off green and so I'm not quite sure if I want to sell half my positions and wait till earnings or if I should wait to earnings in general. I strongly believe that Nvidia is going to beat their earnings I just don't know how drastically that's going to affect the price action.

Super Micro Falls as Hindenburg Takes Aim With Short Report.csv,"Super Micro Computer Inc.'s shares took a hit on Tuesday following a short report from Hindenburg Research that questioned the company's financial practices and transparency. Hindenburg's report alleged significant accounting red flags, undisclosed related-party transactions, and potential violations of sanctions and export controls. Initially, the report caused Super Micro's stock to plummet by as much as 8.7%, but it later rebounded to close down 2.6%. The server manufacturer has been a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, with its high-performance servers in high demand for data centers. This surge in AI-related demand has driven significant growth for the company, doubling its revenue to $14.9 billion in the most recent fiscal year. Despite a steep decline from its March peak, Super Micro's stock remains up over 90% for the year, reflecting continued investor interest in the burgeoning AI sector. However, the Hindenburg report could intensify scrutiny on Super Micro's accounting practices and client relationships, particularly as the company has faced regulatory challenges in the past. In 2020, Super Micro resolved a U.S. SEC investigation by correcting its financial statements and paying a penalty for accounting issues from 2014 to 2017. As the AI market continues to expand, maintaining investor confidence will be crucial for Super Micro, especially amid concerns about the profitability of AI-optimized servers and the potential for increased regulatory oversight.

Technical Analysis Lesson - Reversal Day in Nvidia (NVDA).csv,"Every trader wants to know when the trend is changing from up to down or down to up. This happens when the leadership in the market changes from bulls to bears or bears to bulls. These trend changes are what every trader looks for. If they can accurately predict market turns, they can profit. That’s why they do what they do. Sometimes this change of leadership is slow and takes a long period of time to happen. These changes have price action that tends to show up on a chart as a ‘Rounded Top’ or ‘Rounded Bottom’ pattern. Sometimes the reversal is abrupt and takes place over a few time periods. This action tends to show up on a chart as a ‘V’ or ‘Inverted V’ reversal. But sometimes the trend changes just in one day... These dynamics can show up on a chart as a ‘Reversal Day’ pattern. One may have just happened in the stock of Nivida (NVDA). The Western world would call it an ‘Outside Reversal Day’. In candlestick terminology, it is called a ‘Bearish Engulfing Pattern’. It’s important to note that these candlestick patterns are at least 700 years old. They were developed by Japanese rice traders. It shows that the human nature which is illustrated in charts hasn’t changed. The name doesn’t matter. The action that it illustrates does. On Friday morning, it looked as though the uptrend in NVDA was going to continue for yet another day. It opened at a higher price than Thursday’s close. But then the tide turned… Over the day, the sellers came out of the woodwork. And not only did they hold off the assault. They overpowered the buyers and eventually pushed the price much lower. Importantly, Friday’s closing price was lower than Thursday’s opening price. This is frequently a characteristic of a trend that is reversing. Sometimes the change of leadership from bulls to bears happens over an extended time-period. But sometimes it occurs in just one day. That could be the case here.",0.5201,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9938]"

July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

TSMC thoughts.csv,"TSMC went on a tear so far this year and they seem to be poised for higher growth since they are struggling to even meet demand for their chips right now. Along with main clients like NVIDIA and AMD and APPLE looked to work on AI. HPC revenue has growth i think 30% in their last 2 quarters. They are also mass producing 3nm chips which is starting to make up a nice chunk of their revenue. My main concern is obviously china but also that they are too tied to nvidia. Whenever i see them in the market, if NVIDIA is up 3%, they are up 6%, but if NVIDIA is down 3%, they are down 6-7%. Is it still a buy even though it has risen almost 50% this year?

Understand this about INTC.csv,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9999]"

This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings: Data Sources: SPY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Schwab, Yahoo Finance. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST) SFY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Zacks.com, Yahoo Finance. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST) Key Observations: Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting. It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation. I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors: Expense Ratio: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. Stock Selection Methodology: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. Performance Trends: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. Portfolio Diversification: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. Market Positioning: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. Innovative Approach of SoFi: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy. It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.

Quarterly Highlights: • Earnings per share: 69 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected • Revenue: $5.83 billion vs. $5.72 billion expected • Expected Q3 Sales: $6.7 billion vs. $6.61 billion expected Financial Performance: • Net Income: $265 million (16 cents per share) vs. $27 million (2 cents per share) YoY • Data Center Revenue: Grew 115% YoY to $2.8 billion, driven by AI chip sales (Instinct GPUs) • Client Segment (PCs): Rose 49% YoY to $1.5 billion, indicating a recovering PC market • Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% YoY, below the expected $676 million • Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% YoY, slightly above the expected $856 million AMD’s AI chip sales, reported under the Data Center segment, saw significant growth, highlighting the company’s efforts to compete with Nvidia. AMD’s MI300X AI chip aims to capture market share from Nvidia, which has seen its stock double this year due to high demand for AI GPUs. Despite a challenging year with shares down 6% in 2024, AMD remains the second-largest vendor of data center GPUs, trailing Nvidia. Investors are focused on AMD’s ability to grow its AI business, with the company anticipating $4 billion in AI chip sales this year, accounting for 15% of its total expected sales. AMD’s core business in CPUs for laptops and servers and its growing AI chip segment position the company as a significant player in the evolving technology landscape.

AMD to acquire server builder ZT Systems for 49 billion in cash and stock.csv,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced on Monday its plans to acquire server manufacturer ZT Systems for $4.9 billion, as part of its strategy to bolster its portfolio of artificial intelligence (AI) chips and hardware, and to compete more effectively against Nvidia. The acquisition will be financed with 75% cash and the remaining in stock, leveraging AMD’s $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments reported in the second quarter. The rising demands of AI computing have necessitated the use of thousands of interconnected chips to achieve the required processing power, making the design and construction of server systems increasingly critical. This acquisition will enable AMD to enhance its capabilities in this area. According to AMD CEO Lisa Su, the addition of ZT Systems’ engineers will accelerate the company’s ability to test and deploy its latest AI GPUs on a scale required by major cloud computing companies like Microsoft. Although AMD plans to incorporate ZT Systems into its operations, it has no intention of competing directly in the server manufacturing market. Instead, the company plans to divest its server manufacturing business after the acquisition is finalized, with no discussions yet held with potential buyers. ZT Systems CEO Frank Zhang will join AMD, reporting to Forrest Norrod, AMD’s data center chief. The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2025, will see AMD retaining about 1,000 of ZT Systems' roughly 2,500 employees. AMD anticipates that the acquisition will positively impact its adjusted financial performance by the end of 2025.

AMZN Earnings Preview- What to watch for tonight.csv,"Earnings from Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. will be crucial in guiding the Nasdaq 100 after a volatile period marked by extreme fluctuations. As the last megacaps to release results before Nvidia Corp. in August, these reports will set the tone for tech investors, particularly focusing on how artificial intelligence is driving growth in Amazon’s cloud-computing unit and boosting demand for Apple's next iPhone. The results will also provide valuable insights into the health of consumer spending, with Amazon shares already up about 25% this year. Amazon.com Inc. is set to release its Q2 earnings report after the market closes, with a conference call scheduled for 5:30 p.m. ET. Analysts project the company will report revenue of $148.8 billion, marking an 11% increase year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up from 65 cents in the same period last year. Amazon has guided for Q2 operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, signaling strong performance despite broader economic challenges. Key metrics expected by analysts include AWS revenue at nearly $26 billion, representing more than 17% year-over-year growth, and advertising revenue projected to reach $13 billion, a 21.7% increase from last year. The Stores segment, bolstered by events like Prime Day, is anticipated to show significant activity, while improvements in operating margins, especially in the North America segment, will be closely watched. Analysts also expect updates on AI initiatives and the overall capital expenditures for the year. Comments from analysts emphasize the importance of AI and cloud services for Amazon's future growth. Citi analysts, led by Ronald Josey, anticipate AWS revenue growth accelerated in Q2 due to generative AI tailwinds, while also predicting a beat in operating income thanks to improved retail efficiencies and strong advertising demand. Truist analyst Youssef Squali highlights Amazon's ability to gain share in global e-commerce and sees multiple growth vectors powering the company's continued expansion. Retail performance and consumer spending trends will be significant indicators, especially given mixed reports this earnings season. Analysts like Matt Stucky of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management note the importance of Amazon's retail margin expansion and its impact on profitability. Additionally, the potential for a surprise dividend announcement is a point of interest, as Amazon remains the last major tech company without a dividend program. Amazon's Q2 results will follow earnings reports from key competitors like Microsoft and Google, both of which had mixed receptions based on their cloud and AI performances. Wall Street's current focus is on tangible returns from AI investments, making Amazon's updates on its AI initiatives and AWS growth crucial for investor sentiment. The company's dominant position in the cloud market and ongoing efforts to enhance its e-commerce offerings will be under the microscope. Amazon saw its stock rise following a strong Q1 earnings report, showcasing impressive upside in both EPS and revenue. The standout metric was a significant 221% year-over-year increase in operating income to $15.31 billion, far surpassing the prior guidance of $8-12 billion. The company’s guidance for Q2 operating income of $10-14 billion also exceeded expectations. The Stores segment performed well, driven by successful shopping events like Amazon's Spring Deal Days in Europe and the first Big Spring Sale in Canada and the US. Faster delivery times, enhanced by regionalization efforts and cost-saving measures such as consolidating units into fewer boxes, boosted customer purchase frequency and overall spend. Additionally, Amazon is preparing for its 10th Prime Day event in July, which is expected to further drive sales. Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the highlight of the quarter, with a 17% growth in constant currency, an improvement from previous quarters. AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue business, with significant growth in both generative and non-generative AI workloads. The Advertising Services segment also showed robust growth, with a 24% increase in revenue to $11.82 billion, driven primarily by sponsored ads and early gains in Prime Video ads. Despite guiding Q2 revenue below consensus due to foreign exchange impacts, the strong performance in AWS and advertising has left investors optimistic.",0.5699,"['POSITIVE', 0.9923]"

Some of it just recovered from 2022 to it's pre-2022 state, but Nvidia has 205% growth this year, which is crazy Index funds - the legendary S&P 500. Everyone says it's the most stable etc - but I've found other indexes with even better growth. SP500 usually have the 7-10% yearly return and last 5 years went up 56%, but for example the INDEX Vanguard Growth ETF went up 87% for the last 5 years - and it was also a steady growth, not a lucky spike during one period. What do you think, is it really smart to go with SP500 or are there other ones that are much better, even tho SP500 is so hyped by everyone? and if you agree - what other indexes with better return would you recommend? Leverage - I'm not familiar with how much can you leverage in stocks, but for people that invest in the top 10, which most likely will go up in the future, wouldn't be smarter to invest it with i.e 5x leverage, since the companies like Microsoft are stable, and eventually will grow? Stock Math - let's say I invest $10.000 in a stock and it declines -50%. I know have $5.000. If it goes up by 50%, do I get $7.500 or do I get my $10.000 back?

Fundamentals behind a USA market drop this week & some positives.csv,"The problem areas in the USA: -------------------------- *- The Schiller PE is at a very high level. Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble. So stocks are highly expensive. *- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022! We are more of a service economy than a goods economy, *- World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle. That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local sales declines are offset. Additionally the trade war hampers both sides. *- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels. *- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers. You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term. People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank. However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials. AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth. AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales. So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia. This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW. I don't own any MKSI. This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording. So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN.

Has the market topped already.csv,"The recent performance of the U.S. stock market highlights significant market breadth issues, with a notable divergence between the performance of a few large-cap stocks, dubbed the ""Magnificent Seven,"" and the broader market. These seven stocks, which include tech giants like Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft, have driven much of the market’s gains, with Apple rising 8%, Nvidia up 9%, and Microsoft increasing by 4% last week alone. Percentage of Nasdaq stocks trading above the 50-day MA: This concentration of gains has led the S&P 500 up by 1.50%, despite the Equal Weight S&P 500 index, which better represents the average stock, falling by 0.50%. This divergence indicates that while the index appears strong, the underlying market health is weaker. Liz Ann Sonders, Chief Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab, pointed out that beneath the surface, the average stock in the Nasdaq has experienced a 37% drawdown, compared to the 7% maximum drawdown of the index from its year-to-date high. This suggests significant churn and rotation not visible when solely looking at index level changes. Further, the share of S&P 500 members trading above their 50-day moving average has dropped below 50%, while the index itself continues to trade above its intermediate-term average by more than 4%. Such divergences, last seen in December 1999 before the tech bubble burst, indicate potential market instability.",0.5482,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9981]"

"Impacting NVDA is underlying logic,what does OpenAI is change in strategy mean.csv","Big model pre-training bottleneck: Silicon Valley AI labs are generally struggling with new model training, with OpenAI's Orion and Google's Gemini 2.0 failing to significantly outperform their predecessors, defying the “law of scaling”. This law used to mean that model performance would continue to increase with data and computation, but the scaling effect has now plateaued. Computing in the reasoning phase: To overcome pre-training bottlenecks, OpenAI and other labs are exploring “compute on test” techniques that enable human-like multi-step reasoning by allowing models to generate and evaluate multiple possibilities in real-time during the reasoning phase. This approach can be used more effectively for complex tasks such as mathematics and coding to optimize reasoning performance. Hardware Demand Shift: Market demand is likely to shift from large-scale pre-training clusters to inference clouds as new technologies reduce parameter requirements. This will weaken NVIDIA's monopoly in the training chip market, and the inference chip market may see more competition, especially as companies such as Groq may fill the new demand.

Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9443]"

Hi! I’m Dan Howley, the tech editor at Yahoo Finance, and Nvidia has seemingly been at the forefront of virtually everything I’ve covered since ChatGPT hit the scene in 2022. I’ve been covering the tech space for 13 years and tracking Nvidia for even longer. I built my first desktop PC with an Nvidia graphics card in high school and have continued using its products ever since. Now I, like everyone else, am focused on Nvidia’s AI efforts, from reporting on how they’re dealing with the threat of increased competition to attending the company’s GTC conference to chatting with CEO Jensen Huang alongside my colleague Julie Hyman. With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia’s chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like AMD are gaining steam, and Nvidia’s own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant. How that plays out over the next few years is anyone’s guess. In today’s fiscal 2025 third quarter earnings report, Nvidia beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines on the strength of sales of its high-powered AI chips. 💵 Revenue: $35.08B vs $33.2B expected 💲 Adjusted EPS: $0.81 vs $0.74 expected 💾 Data center revenue: $30.8B vs $29B expected Nvidia also said it anticipates revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, for the fiscal fourth quarter. That's just ahead of Wall Street expectations of $37 billion. I’ll be back tomorrow, Nov. 21, at 10 a.m. ET to answer your questions about Nvidia’s latest earnings, the market reaction, and where the stock goes from here. That does it for me for today.

Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&P 500 gains.csv,"= just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing = The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023 https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9 The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions. It’s an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve’s inflation battle, noted FactSet’s Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post. The 10 top performing days for the S&P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%. The S&P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday’s close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%. Through Dec. 22, the S&P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%. Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said. That didn’t mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote. Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found. Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July. The strategy “indicates the Fed’s measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,” Jakobsen said. The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks’ bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group’s announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering. SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a “mini” banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown. Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks — Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78% , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, 0.16%, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%, Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%, Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%, and Meta Platforms Inc. META, 0.56%. See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024? Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind. The S&P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted. In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high: The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&P 500’s weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted. Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&P 500’s overall return, he wrote, with the company’s success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.",0.5482,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9995]"
Mega-caps vs small caps.csv,"The current state of the stock market exhibits a stark contrast between the performance of mega-cap and small-cap stocks, as investors grapple with mixed signals from major corporations and broader market indices.  Recent developments have highlighted this divide, with Microsoft's upcoming earnings report set to further shape the narrative. Mega-Cap Weakness and Market Impact Microsoft, a key player in the technology sector, is set to report its earnings after the market close, and its performance could significantly influence investor sentiment.  The recent underperformance of large-cap stocks like Merck and Procter & Gamble, both of which have disappointed with earnings guidance, has contributed to the Nasdaq Composite's (-0.9%) and S&P 500's (-0.4%) downward pressure.  This weakness is reflected in the Vanguard Mega-Cap Growth ETF (MGK), which is down 1.1%. Small-Cap Resilience In contrast, small-cap stocks have shown relative strength, with the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 Value Index posting gains.  The equal-weighted S&P 500 is also holding its own, indicating that smaller companies are providing a stabilizing force in the market.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, buoyed by the financials and energy sectors, adds to this resilience. Sectors in Focus The IT sector, weighed down by NVIDIA's (-5.0%) decline ahead of AMD's earnings release, is leading the pack of losers.  Consumer staples, also negatively impacted, are lagging behind. On the other hand, financials, and energy sectors are posting gains, offering a glimmer of hope for investors seeking opportunities. Treasuries and Market Sentiment The Treasury market remains relatively calm, with the 2-yr note yield down to 4.38% and the 10-yr note yield at 4.17%.  Economic indicators, such as the better-than-expected consumer confidence index and the Bank of Japan's policy decision, have not sparked significant market movements, suggesting that investors are cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's FOMC decision on Wednesday. As we await Microsoft's earnings report, the stock market's divide between mega-cap and small-cap stocks is a cause for concern, especially for those relying on large-cap performance.  However, the resilience of small-cap companies and select sectors is providing a silver lining. Investors should stay vigilant, monitor market reactions to key earnings releases, and consider a diversified portfolio that takes into account the current market dynamics.  The Federal Reserve's decision will likely play a crucial role in determining the market's next course of action.",0.5419,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9136]"

MSFT faces long-term potential disadvantages.csv,"I think one of the main reasons Microsoft is a great long-term investment is its long history of generating a lot of free cash flow. At the time of writing, the company's free cash flow margin is over 30%, with free cash flow rising from $15.9 billion in 2009 to $74.1 billion in the last 12 months. This financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments. While Microsoft may not seem like a value investment, in my opinion, its pricing is reasonable given its continued revenue and earnings growth, and it's likely to continue for the foreseeable future. I estimate EPS growth of 13% on a regular basis over the next 12 months. Based on this projection, I have a price target of $482.40 and estimate that the stock will trade at a non-GAAP P/E ratio of around 36. Looking ahead, I expect Microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15% over the next 5 to 10 years. While this prospect necessitates buying the stock at a fair valuation, I believe the current price provides an opportunity. The company's forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is only 6.5% above its five-year average, while its forward diluted earnings per share growth rate is nearly the same at 5.8%. MSFT faces long-term potential headwinds One potential challenge to Microsoft's long-term growth in AI is that its adoption can be cyclical. Currently, the demand for AI systems is high, which has prompted Microsoft and other big tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion. However, when the current trend peaks (likely due to macroeconomic constraints), growth may slow. According to the TipRanks risk analysis tool, Microsoft is exposed to 32% risk from legal and regulatory factors, which is higher than the industry average and could impact its AI operations due to increased scrutiny of data privacy and AI governance. Given this outlook, I expect some volatility in Microsoft's long-term growth trajectory, although it may not be as good as NVIDIA NVDA -0.06% ▼ and so on semiconductor companies so obvious. As market sentiment fluctuates, cyclical price and valuation declines coincide with temporarily lower growth rates and may provide more attractive buying opportunities. There is also a risk that Microsoft and other Big Tech players could over-invest in AI infrastructure. With 21% of its risk related to Tech & Innovation, Microsoft’s heavy investment in AI-driven initiatives, including data center infrastructure, could result in lower-than-expected returns if industry growth does not meet expectations. This may impact free cash flow margins in the medium term, contributing to further volatility.",0.5607,"['NEGATIVE', 0.8794]"

Nvidia announces 50 billion stock buyback.csv,"Nvidia said Wednesday that its board of directors has approved a $50 billion stock buyback. The computer chip giant announced the share repurchase as part of its fiscal second-quarter earnings, in which it reported earnings and guidance that surpassed Wall Street expectations. Nvidia returned $15.4 billion to shareholders in share repurposes and cash dividends as part of the company’s first half of its fiscal 2025. The company said it had $7.5 billion remaining under its share repurchase plan, as of the end of its fiscal second quarter. Last year, Nvidia announced a $25 billion share buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results. Companies often experience a boom to their stock price after revealing stock buyback plans. In May, for instance, Apple announced a $110 billion stock buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results that showed overall sales fell 4% year over year and iPhone sales dropped 10% year over year. However, the iPhone maker’s shares rose 7% in after-hours trading, likely because Apple’s share buyback was the biggest in corporate history. With Nvidia’s shares dropping 4% in extended trading despite reporting solid financial results and announcing a stock buyback, some experts believe the company has been doing so well that it is getting harder to impress investors.

DARP - NVIDIA is their top position at 19.4% of assets. They also have exposure to the underlying commodities that are in the chips, following the ""Energy Transition"" growth theme we've seen companies move to over the past couple of years. NVIDIA's earnings today are going to be important to the market, I think a lot of people will decide to buy in and believe the macro cycle for AI will continue if they beat earnings.

Nvidia More Room to Run Just Getting Started.csv,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they’ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don’t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical. Yes, Nvidia’s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn’t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now. Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn’t possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia’s place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn’t happened and Nvidia’s only gotten stronger. That’s not to say over time Nvidia won’t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it’s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution. Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations. I don’t think AI is a bubble but I do think that Nvidia and the market as a whole can get ahead of themselves.

"Nvidia reports earnings, Fed gathers in Jackson Hole What about this week.csv","In the final week of August, investors will be focused on two major events: Nvidia's earnings and the Federal Reserve's annual meeting in Jackson Hole. The Jackson Hole Economic Symposium will kick off on Thursday, with Fed Chair Jay Powell's address serving as the major event. Powell's comments on interest rates, the economy, and any indication that inflationary pressures are driving a reassessment of the Fed's present aims will be scrutinized. On the corporate front, Nvidia headlines the earnings story this week, with the chipmaker scheduled to publish data from a quarter that caused the chipmaker to increase its revenue forecast by 50%. Lowe's, BJ's Wholesale Club, and Peloton are also set to announce earnings this week. August is shaping up to be the worst month for stocks this year, with all three main averages closing last week lower after a hawkish read of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting sent equities lower and Treasury rates higher in the second half of the week. Economic data continues to come in stronger than expected, with the July retail sales report indicating a 0.7% increase in sales for the month, about double what economists forecast. The AtlantaFed's GDPNow projection now predicts third-quarter GDP growth of 5.8%, the strongest rate since the fourth quarter of 2021. Inflation has declined dramatically since Powell's Jackson Hole speech last year, when he predicted rates will climb until the ""job is done,"" lowering inflation. Powell has stated as recently as July that inflation is ""well above"" the Fed's long-run objective of 2%. On the corporate front, all eyes will be on Nvidia, which predicted that artificial intelligence demand will increase its current quarter sales projection from $7 billion to $11 billion. Nvidia stock is up about 200% year to date, but its gains have slowed along with the market since mid-July.

Looking further ahead, Oracle projects over $104 billion in revenue by fiscal 2029, along with a 20% year-over-year growth in earnings per share. Speaking at the Oracle CloudWorld event in Las Vegas, CEO Safra Catz expressed confidence in achieving these ambitious targets, pointing to new partnerships that allow Oracle’s database software to be offered through major cloud providers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Oracle’s strong performance continued this week as its stock gained roughly 15% over the past three trading days, setting a new record and marking a 55% increase for the year—second only to Nvidia among large-cap tech companies. Oracle’s cloud infrastructure revenue jumped 45% last quarter, outpacing its competitors and benefiting from businesses transitioning their workloads to the cloud.

Qualcomm Approached Intel About a Takeover in Recent Days.csv,"Qualcomm recently approached Intel with a takeover proposal, marking what could be one of the largest tech deals in recent memory, according to sources. Intel, once valued at over $290 billion, has seen its market cap fall to around $90 billion after a challenging year in which its shares dropped 60%. While a deal is far from guaranteed, Qualcomm’s interest comes as Intel struggles to recover under CEO Pat Gelsinger’s turnaround plan, which has yet to deliver significant results. Should Intel be receptive, the deal could face heavy antitrust scrutiny, though some argue it might bolster U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor industry. Qualcomm may consider offloading parts of Intel to complete the acquisition. Both companies have sought to capitalize on the AI boom, though they’ve lagged behind Nvidia. Intel, grappling with factory delays and cost-cutting measures, is receiving government subsidies as part of its efforts to build chip factories. A Qualcomm takeover could enhance its portfolio by adding Intel’s dominance in PCs and servers to its smartphone chip business. Despite this potential merger, Intel continues to face major hurdles, including the possible need to split its design and manufacturing operations amid growing calls for the company to separate its business divisions.

Serious question from someone who took a four-year trading break.csv,Hey everyone After a long long hiatus and licking my wounds I decided to try trading once again. Recently I've been changing up my approach and doing 5-7 DTE spy options. And it's been going pretty decent however recently I got a couple of August 30th calls for Nvidia I managed to get in at a good position for 133 calls. My thesis is that it's going to keep pumping up to the day of earnings. I don't have any intention of holding the position up until expiration. My question is regarding theta decay and volatility. I know that the closer I got to the expiration the less profit I'll see as a percentage of my position. And I also understand that during high levels of volatility it can go both ways. And I'm not really asking for specific advice just kind of guidance or knowledge as to how that may affect my position. I'm holding them over the weekend and I'm expecting Monday to start off a little red but to finish off green and so I'm not quite sure if I want to sell half my positions and wait till earnings or if I should wait to earnings in general. I strongly believe that Nvidia is going to beat their earnings I just don't know how drastically that's going to affect the price action.

Super Micro Falls as Hindenburg Takes Aim With Short Report.csv,"Super Micro Computer Inc.'s shares took a hit on Tuesday following a short report from Hindenburg Research that questioned the company's financial practices and transparency. Hindenburg's report alleged significant accounting red flags, undisclosed related-party transactions, and potential violations of sanctions and export controls. Initially, the report caused Super Micro's stock to plummet by as much as 8.7%, but it later rebounded to close down 2.6%. The server manufacturer has been a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, with its high-performance servers in high demand for data centers. This surge in AI-related demand has driven significant growth for the company, doubling its revenue to $14.9 billion in the most recent fiscal year. Despite a steep decline from its March peak, Super Micro's stock remains up over 90% for the year, reflecting continued investor interest in the burgeoning AI sector. However, the Hindenburg report could intensify scrutiny on Super Micro's accounting practices and client relationships, particularly as the company has faced regulatory challenges in the past. In 2020, Super Micro resolved a U.S. SEC investigation by correcting its financial statements and paying a penalty for accounting issues from 2014 to 2017. As the AI market continues to expand, maintaining investor confidence will be crucial for Super Micro, especially amid concerns about the profitability of AI-optimized servers and the potential for increased regulatory oversight.

Technical Analysis Lesson - Reversal Day in Nvidia (NVDA).csv,"Every trader wants to know when the trend is changing from up to down or down to up. This happens when the leadership in the market changes from bulls to bears or bears to bulls. These trend changes are what every trader looks for. If they can accurately predict market turns, they can profit. That’s why they do what they do. Sometimes this change of leadership is slow and takes a long period of time to happen. These changes have price action that tends to show up on a chart as a ‘Rounded Top’ or ‘Rounded Bottom’ pattern. Sometimes the reversal is abrupt and takes place over a few time periods. This action tends to show up on a chart as a ‘V’ or ‘Inverted V’ reversal. But sometimes the trend changes just in one day... These dynamics can show up on a chart as a ‘Reversal Day’ pattern. One may have just happened in the stock of Nivida (NVDA). The Western world would call it an ‘Outside Reversal Day’. In candlestick terminology, it is called a ‘Bearish Engulfing Pattern’. It’s important to note that these candlestick patterns are at least 700 years old. They were developed by Japanese rice traders. It shows that the human nature which is illustrated in charts hasn’t changed. The name doesn’t matter. The action that it illustrates does. On Friday morning, it looked as though the uptrend in NVDA was going to continue for yet another day. It opened at a higher price than Thursday’s close. But then the tide turned… Over the day, the sellers came out of the woodwork. And not only did they hold off the assault. They overpowered the buyers and eventually pushed the price much lower. Importantly, Friday’s closing price was lower than Thursday’s opening price. This is frequently a characteristic of a trend that is reversing. Sometimes the change of leadership from bulls to bears happens over an extended time-period. But sometimes it occurs in just one day. That could be the case here.",0.5201,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9938]"

TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand.csv,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

Understand this about INTC.csv,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9999]"

Notably, major contributions to the market's upward momentum are attributed to Big Tech stocks, which have been pivotal for over a year. Fueled, in part, by the fervor surrounding artificial intelligence technology, notable players like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon emerged as formidable forces, each registering gains of at least 1% and significantly impacting the S&P 500's ascent.

VOO and chill but can you really not make smart moves.csv,"Hello, 21 year old here I understand some things have been proven over time, like ETFs boglehead philosophy etc. time in the market over timing the market but what about words like ""be greedy when others are fearful and be fearful when others are greedy?"" When you are young, let's say early 20s, this is the time to take risks isn't it? Every right risk you take now, compounds like crazy, every mistake? You are young you can still recover and learn. I'm not saying dump 100% like wallstreetbets gambling, but I'm talking about investing in stuff you believe in, despite the temporary bad financials or pr or being undervalued? For example, I am a software/hardware engineering student, and I was a gamer as a child. I knew a lot about companies like Intel, AMD, Nvidia etc. In college I knew Nvdia was gonna blow up because of CUDA and what not, AMD would blow intel out of the way, QCOM I was a fan of because I did some research on their chips. These are very entry level knowledge, but if it's enough for me to believe in working for these companies, isn't it enough to invest let's say 10%, 20%? Instead of dumping all into HYSA T bills and VTI/VOO VXUS etc and using 5% for individual picks? If shit goes down market goes down, I saw the covid crash happen infront of my eyes, I had 10k savings from my first internship, I could have bought these shares I believed so much in, but I didn't, it stayed in a HYSA. Sure you might not pick tesla before the run or nvidia, but you can pick amzn msft goog amd and if all these become bad picks and fail me then I don't think I should work for the tech industry right? If tech fails I fail because thats what I'm going into, and if I can risk my career for a job in such a ""volatile"" market then why can't I ""risk"" 30-50% of my portfolio in the same tier companies? Can someone experienced help me out with these thoughts? To me at this age it seems like VOO will get you the american dream comfortably, but VOO and good picks will make you rich, and if the market really fails dotcom and whatnot, you have to keep faith in the market and keep earning, some company will rise and if you are in the scene you will know about it, right?

Why am I bullish on SFY instead of SPY.csv,"A comparison analysis between the holdings of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY), I have compiled information from the most recent available data. Below is a table showing the top 10 holdings for each ETF along with their percentage weight in the respective ETFs. This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings: Data Sources: SPY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Schwab, Yahoo Finance. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST) SFY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Zacks.com, Yahoo Finance. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST) Key Observations: Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting. It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation. I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors: Expense Ratio: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. Stock Selection Methodology: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. Performance Trends: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. Portfolio Diversification: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. Market Positioning: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. Innovative Approach of SoFi: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy. It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.

"Why Are Analysts Increasing NVIDIA’s Price Target Is It Out of Fear That Something Bad Will Happen, .csv","NVIDIA, often considered the heart of AI stocks, has recently been in the spotlight as analysts uniformly raise their stock targets. To me, this trend seems somewhat peculiar, even considering the current earnings season. The buoyant optimism surrounding the stock’s potential rise is sparking doubt in my mind. Should the stock underperform, it will be a litmus test of these analysts’ sincerity, raising questions about whether they may be manipulating public sentiment. In the broader context of the semiconductor sector, the recent quarterly earnings have been largely underwhelming. Yet, all semiconductor stocks appear to be buoyed by NVIDIA’s momentum. A stumble in NVIDIA’s stock could trigger a broader tech market downfall, while success could reignite a bullish trend for tech stocks. My intuition, however, leans towards a potential disappointment. NVIDIA might surpass current estimates but simultaneously lower their future guidance due to sluggish growth.

Worse case scenario the perfect Bear cocktail.csv,"After reading all the comments from my last post and doing some more thinking.

February 15, 2024: Jobless claims rise. Doesn't alter the market but adds to the cocktail mix. February 16, 2024: A higher-than-expected PPI indicates increasing costs at the producer level, which can signal rising inflationary pressures. Producers might pass these higher costs onto consumers, leading to an increase in consumer prices and overall inflation. The Fed to consider tightening monetary policy more aggressively than previously anticipated to combat inflation. This could include raising interest rates or adjusting the pace of tapering asset purchases. Financial markets don't react negatively to a higher-than-expected PPI, as it they priced it in from the CPI report.

Investors are focused on AMD’s ability to grow its AI business, with the company anticipating $4 billion in AI chip sales this year, accounting for 15% of its total expected sales. AMD’s core business in CPUs for laptops and servers and its growing AI chip segment position the company as a significant player in the evolving technology landscape.

AMD to acquire server builder ZT Systems for 49 billion in cash and stock.csv,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced on Monday its plans to acquire server manufacturer ZT Systems for $4.9 billion, as part of its strategy to bolster its portfolio of artificial intelligence (AI) chips and hardware, and to compete more effectively against Nvidia. The acquisition will be financed with 75% cash and the remaining in stock, leveraging AMD’s $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments reported in the second quarter. The rising demands of AI computing have necessitated the use of thousands of interconnected chips to achieve the required processing power, making the design and construction of server systems increasingly critical. This acquisition will enable AMD to enhance its capabilities in this area. According to AMD CEO Lisa Su, the addition of ZT Systems’ engineers will accelerate the company’s ability to test and deploy its latest AI GPUs on a scale required by major cloud computing companies like Microsoft. Although AMD plans to incorporate ZT Systems into its operations, it has no intention of competing directly in the server manufacturing market. Instead, the company plans to divest its server manufacturing business after the acquisition is finalized, with no discussions yet held with potential buyers. ZT Systems CEO Frank Zhang will join AMD, reporting to Forrest Norrod, AMD’s data center chief. The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2025, will see AMD retaining about 1,000 of ZT Systems' roughly 2,500 employees. AMD anticipates that the acquisition will positively impact its adjusted financial performance by the end of 2025.

AMZN Earnings Preview- What to watch for tonight.csv,"Earnings from Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. will be crucial in guiding the Nasdaq 100 after a volatile period marked by extreme fluctuations. As the last megacaps to release results before Nvidia Corp. in August, these reports will set the tone for tech investors, particularly focusing on how artificial intelligence is driving growth in Amazon’s cloud-computing unit and boosting demand for Apple's next iPhone. The results will also provide valuable insights into the health of consumer spending, with Amazon shares already up about 25% this year. Amazon.com Inc. is set to release its Q2 earnings report after the market closes, with a conference call scheduled for 5:30 p.m. ET. Analysts project the company will report revenue of $148.8 billion, marking an 11% increase year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up from 65 cents in the same period last year. Amazon has guided for Q2 operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, signaling strong performance despite broader economic challenges. Key metrics expected by analysts include AWS revenue at nearly $26 billion, representing more than 17% year-over-year growth, and advertising revenue projected to reach $13 billion, a 21.7% increase from last year. The Stores segment, bolstered by events like Prime Day, is anticipated to show significant activity, while improvements in operating margins, especially in the North America segment, will be closely watched. Analysts also expect updates on AI initiatives and the overall capital expenditures for the year. Comments from analysts emphasize the importance of AI and cloud services for Amazon's future growth. Citi analysts, led by Ronald Josey, anticipate AWS revenue growth accelerated in Q2 due to generative AI tailwinds, while also predicting a beat in operating income thanks to improved retail efficiencies and strong advertising demand. Truist analyst Youssef Squali highlights Amazon's ability to gain share in global e-commerce and sees multiple growth vectors powering the company's continued expansion. Retail performance and consumer spending trends will be significant indicators, especially given mixed reports this earnings season. Analysts like Matt Stucky of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management note the importance of Amazon's retail margin expansion and its impact on profitability. Additionally, the potential for a surprise dividend announcement is a point of interest, as Amazon remains the last major tech company without a dividend program. Amazon's Q2 results will follow earnings reports from key competitors like Microsoft and Google, both of which had mixed receptions based on their cloud and AI performances. Wall Street's current focus is on tangible returns from AI investments, making Amazon's updates on its AI initiatives and AWS growth crucial for investor sentiment. The company's dominant position in the cloud market and ongoing efforts to enhance its e-commerce offerings will be under the microscope. Amazon saw its stock rise following a strong Q1 earnings report, showcasing impressive upside in both EPS and revenue. The standout metric was a significant 221% year-over-year increase in operating income to $15.31 billion, far surpassing the prior guidance of $8-12 billion. The company’s guidance for Q2 operating income of $10-14 billion also exceeded expectations. The Stores segment performed well, driven by successful shopping events like Amazon's Spring Deal Days in Europe and the first Big Spring Sale in Canada and the US. Faster delivery times, enhanced by regionalization efforts and cost-saving measures such as consolidating units into fewer boxes, boosted customer purchase frequency and overall spend. Additionally, Amazon is preparing for its 10th Prime Day event in July, which is expected to further drive sales. Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the highlight of the quarter, with a 17% growth in constant currency, an improvement from previous quarters. AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue business, with significant growth in both generative and non-generative AI workloads. The Advertising Services segment also showed robust growth, with a 24% increase in revenue to $11.82 billion, driven primarily by sponsored ads and early gains in Prime Video ads. Despite guiding Q2 revenue below consensus due to foreign exchange impacts, the strong performance in AWS and advertising has left investors optimistic.",0.5699,"['POSITIVE', 0.9923]"

I'm wondering whether I should wait for it to drop, because most of the stock market is green this year, so I have a feeling it may drop since it grew so much, what do you think? Some of it just recovered from 2022 to it's pre-2022 state, but Nvidia has 205% growth this year, which is crazy Index funds - the legendary S&P 500. Everyone says it's the most stable etc - but I've found other indexes with even better growth. SP500 usually have the 7-10% yearly return and last 5 years went up 56%, but for example the INDEX Vanguard Growth ETF went up 87% for the last 5 years - and it was also a steady growth, not a lucky spike during one period. What do you think, is it really smart to go with SP500 or are there other ones that are much better, even tho SP500 is so hyped by everyone? and if you agree - what other indexes with better return would you recommend? Leverage - I'm not familiar with how much can you leverage in stocks, but for people that invest in the top 10, which most likely will go up in the future, wouldn't be smarter to invest it with i.e 5x leverage, since the companies like Microsoft are stable, and eventually will grow? Stock Math - let's say I invest $10.000 in a stock and it declines -50%. I know have $5.000. If it goes up by 50%, do I get $7.500 or do I get my $10.000 back?

Fundamentals behind a USA market drop this week & some positives.csv,"The problem areas in the USA: -------------------------- *- The Schiller PE is at a very high level. Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble. So stocks are highly expensive. *- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022! We are more of a service economy than a goods economy, *- World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle. That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local sales declines are offset. Additionally the trade war hampers both sides. *- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels. *- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers. You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term. People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank. However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials. AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth. AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales. So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia. This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW. I don't own any MKSI. This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording. So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN. Good areas: -------------------------------------- *- Labor productivity is up consistently since Q3 2022. one can see tradingeconomics dot com USA productivity *- Gasoline is lower than last year *- Retail sales are going fine, [ per a recent NPR radio article ] Nuetral ---------------------------------------- *- Labor force participation is not higher than Sept 2023.

"Impacting NVDA is underlying logic,what does OpenAI is change in strategy mean.csv","Big model pre-training bottleneck: Silicon Valley AI labs are generally struggling with new model training, with OpenAI's Orion and Google's Gemini 2.0 failing to significantly outperform their predecessors, defying the “law of scaling”. This law used to mean that model performance would continue to increase with data and computation, but the scaling effect has now plateaued. Computing in the reasoning phase: To overcome pre-training bottlenecks, OpenAI and other labs are exploring “compute on test” techniques that enable human-like multi-step reasoning by allowing models to generate and evaluate multiple possibilities in real-time during the reasoning phase. This approach can be used more effectively for complex tasks such as mathematics and coding to optimize reasoning performance. Hardware Demand Shift: Market demand is likely to shift from large-scale pre-training clusters to inference clouds as new technologies reduce parameter requirements. This will weaken NVIDIA's monopoly in the training chip market, and the inference chip market may see more competition, especially as companies such as Groq may fill the new demand. Capital Trends: Venture capital organizations are highly concerned about this change, and are gradually investing more resources in distributed inference clouds to cater to the distributed server needs of inference computing.",0.5346,"['POSITIVE', 0.6048]"

Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9443]"

Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&P 500 gains.csv,"= just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing = The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023 https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9 The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions. It’s an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve’s inflation battle, noted FactSet’s Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post. The 10 top performing days for the S&P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%. The S&P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday’s close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%. Through Dec. 22, the S&P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%. Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said. That didn’t mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote. Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found. Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July. The strategy “indicates the Fed’s measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,” Jakobsen said. The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks’ bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group’s announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering. SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a “mini” banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown. Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks — Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78% , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, 0.16%, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%, Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%, Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%, and Meta Platforms Inc. META, 0.56%. See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024? Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind. The S&P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted. In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high: The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&P 500’s weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted. Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&P 500’s overall return, he wrote, with the company’s success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.",0.5482,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9995]"
Mega-caps vs small caps.csv,"The current state of the stock market exhibits a stark contrast between the performance of mega-cap and small-cap stocks, as investors grapple with mixed signals from major corporations and broader market indices.  Recent developments have highlighted this divide, with Microsoft's upcoming earnings report set to further shape the narrative. Mega-Cap Weakness and Market Impact Microsoft, a key player in the technology sector, is set to report its earnings after the market close, and its performance could significantly influence investor sentiment.  The recent underperformance of large-cap stocks like Merck and Procter & Gamble, both of which have disappointed with earnings guidance, has contributed to the Nasdaq Composite's (-0.9%) and S&P 500's (-0.4%) downward pressure.  This weakness is reflected in the Vanguard Mega-Cap Growth ETF (MGK), which is down 1.1%. Small-Cap Resilience In contrast, small-cap stocks have shown relative strength, with the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 Value Index posting gains.  The equal-weighted S&P 500 is also holding its own, indicating that smaller companies are providing a stabilizing force in the market.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, buoyed by the financials and energy sectors, adds to this resilience. Sectors in Focus The IT sector, weighed down by NVIDIA's (-5.0%) decline ahead of AMD's earnings release, is leading the pack of losers.  Consumer staples, also negatively impacted, are lagging behind. On the other hand, financials, and energy sectors are posting gains, offering a glimmer of hope for investors seeking opportunities. Treasuries and Market Sentiment The Treasury market remains relatively calm, with the 2-yr note yield down to 4.38% and the 10-yr note yield at 4.17%.  Economic indicators, such as the better-than-expected consumer confidence index and the Bank of Japan's policy decision, have not sparked significant market movements, suggesting that investors are cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's FOMC decision on Wednesday. As we await Microsoft's earnings report, the stock market's divide between mega-cap and small-cap stocks is a cause for concern, especially for those relying on large-cap performance.  However, the resilience of small-cap companies and select sectors is providing a silver lining. Investors should stay vigilant, monitor market reactions to key earnings releases, and consider a diversified portfolio that takes into account the current market dynamics.  The Federal Reserve's decision will likely play a crucial role in determining the market's next course of action.",0.5419,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9136]"

MSFT faces long-term potential disadvantages.csv,"I think one of the main reasons Microsoft is a great long-term investment is its long history of generating a lot of free cash flow. At the time of writing, the company's free cash flow margin is over 30%, with free cash flow rising from $15.9 billion in 2009 to $74.1 billion in the last 12 months. This financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments. While Microsoft may not seem like a value investment, in my opinion, its pricing is reasonable given its continued revenue and earnings growth, and it's likely to continue for the foreseeable future. I estimate EPS growth of 13% on a regular basis over the next 12 months. Based on this projection, I have a price target of $482.40 and estimate that the stock will trade at a non-GAAP P/E ratio of around 36. Looking ahead, I expect Microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15% over the next 5 to 10 years. While this prospect necessitates buying the stock at a fair valuation, I believe the current price provides an opportunity. The company's forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is only 6.5% above its five-year average, while its forward diluted earnings per share growth rate is nearly the same at 5.8%. MSFT faces long-term potential headwinds One potential challenge to Microsoft's long-term growth in AI is that its adoption can be cyclical. Currently, the demand for AI systems is high, which has prompted Microsoft and other big tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion. However, when the current trend peaks (likely due to macroeconomic constraints), growth may slow. According to the TipRanks risk analysis tool, Microsoft is exposed to 32% risk from legal and regulatory factors, which is higher than the industry average and could impact its AI operations due to increased scrutiny of data privacy and AI governance. Given this outlook, I expect some volatility in Microsoft's long-term growth trajectory, although it may not be as good as NVIDIA NVDA -0.06% ▼ and so on semiconductor companies so obvious. As market sentiment fluctuates, cyclical price and valuation declines coincide with temporarily lower growth rates and may provide more attractive buying opportunities. There is also a risk that Microsoft and other Big Tech players could over-invest in AI infrastructure. With 21% of its risk related to Tech & Innovation, Microsoft’s heavy investment in AI-driven initiatives, including data center infrastructure, could result in lower-than-expected returns if industry growth does not meet expectations. This may impact free cash flow margins in the medium term, contributing to further volatility.",0.5607,"['NEGATIVE', 0.8794]"

Nvidia announces 50 billion stock buyback.csv,"Nvidia said Wednesday that its board of directors has approved a $50 billion stock buyback.

The company said it had $7.5 billion remaining under its share repurchase plan, as of the end of its fiscal second quarter. Last year, Nvidia announced a $25 billion share buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results. Companies often experience a boom to their stock price after revealing stock buyback plans.

Nvidia More Room to Run Just Getting Started.csv,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they’ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don’t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical. Yes, Nvidia’s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn’t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now.

There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution.

"Nvidia reports earnings, Fed gathers in Jackson Hole What about this week.csv","In the final week of August, investors will be focused on two major events: Nvidia's earnings and the Federal Reserve's annual meeting in Jackson Hole. The Jackson Hole Economic Symposium will kick off on Thursday, with Fed Chair Jay Powell's address serving as the major event. Powell's comments on interest rates, the economy, and any indication that inflationary pressures are driving a reassessment of the Fed's present aims will be scrutinized. On the corporate front, Nvidia headlines the earnings story this week, with the chipmaker scheduled to publish data from a quarter that caused the chipmaker to increase its revenue forecast by 50%. Lowe's, BJ's Wholesale Club, and Peloton are also set to announce earnings this week. August is shaping up to be the worst month for stocks this year, with all three main averages closing last week lower after a hawkish read of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting sent equities lower and Treasury rates higher in the second half of the week. Economic data continues to come in stronger than expected, with the July retail sales report indicating a 0.7% increase in sales for the month, about double what economists forecast. The AtlantaFed's GDPNow projection now predicts third-quarter GDP growth of 5.8%, the strongest rate since the fourth quarter of 2021. Inflation has declined dramatically since Powell's Jackson Hole speech last year, when he predicted rates will climb until the ""job is done,"" lowering inflation. Powell has stated as recently as July that inflation is ""well above"" the Fed's long-run objective of 2%. On the corporate front, all eyes will be on Nvidia, which predicted that artificial intelligence demand will increase its current quarter sales projection from $7 billion to $11 billion.

"Oracle bumps up fiscal 2026 revenue forecast, lifting stock 6%.csv","Oracle lifted its fiscal 2026 revenue forecast on Thursday, pushing its stock up nearly 6% in after-hours trading.

Looking further ahead, Oracle projects over $104 billion in revenue by fiscal 2029, along with a 20% year-over-year growth in earnings per share. Speaking at the Oracle CloudWorld event in Las Vegas, CEO Safra Catz expressed confidence in achieving these ambitious targets, pointing to new partnerships that allow Oracle’s database software to be offered through major cloud providers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Oracle’s strong performance continued this week as its stock gained roughly 15% over the past three trading days, setting a new record and marking a 55% increase for the year—second only to Nvidia among large-cap tech companies. Oracle’s cloud infrastructure revenue jumped 45% last quarter, outpacing its competitors and benefiting from businesses transitioning their workloads to the cloud. The company is also positioning itself to capitalize on the growing demand for artificial intelligence, announcing its cloud unit has secured orders for over 131,000 next-generation Nvidia GPUs. As Oracle scales up its cloud and AI capabilities, it plans to double its capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 to support this growth, signaling continued momentum in its expansion efforts.

Qualcomm Approached Intel About a Takeover in Recent Days.csv,"Qualcomm recently approached Intel with a takeover proposal, marking what could be one of the largest tech deals in recent memory, according to sources. Intel, once valued at over $290 billion, has seen its market cap fall to around $90 billion after a challenging year in which its shares dropped 60%. While a deal is far from guaranteed, Qualcomm’s interest comes as Intel struggles to recover under CEO Pat Gelsinger’s turnaround plan, which has yet to deliver significant results. Should Intel be receptive, the deal could face heavy antitrust scrutiny, though some argue it might bolster U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor industry. Qualcomm may consider offloading parts of Intel to complete the acquisition. Both companies have sought to capitalize on the AI boom, though they’ve lagged behind Nvidia. Intel, grappling with factory delays and cost-cutting measures, is receiving government subsidies as part of its efforts to build chip factories. A Qualcomm takeover could enhance its portfolio by adding Intel’s dominance in PCs and servers to its smartphone chip business. Despite this potential merger, Intel continues to face major hurdles, including the possible need to split its design and manufacturing operations amid growing calls for the company to separate its business divisions.

Serious question from someone who took a four-year trading break.csv,Hey everyone After a long long hiatus and licking my wounds I decided to try trading once again. Recently I've been changing up my approach and doing 5-7 DTE spy options. And it's been going pretty decent however recently I got a couple of August 30th calls for Nvidia I managed to get in at a good position for 133 calls. My thesis is that it's going to keep pumping up to the day of earnings. I don't have any intention of holding the position up until expiration. My question is regarding theta decay and volatility. I know that the closer I got to the expiration the less profit I'll see as a percentage of my position. And I also understand that during high levels of volatility it can go both ways. And I'm not really asking for specific advice just kind of guidance or knowledge as to how that may affect my position. I'm holding them over the weekend and I'm expecting Monday to start off a little red but to finish off green and so I'm not quite sure if I want to sell half my positions and wait till earnings or if I should wait to earnings in general. I strongly believe that Nvidia is going to beat their earnings I just don't know how drastically that's going to affect the price action. Any and all input is definitely appreciated Thanks in advance,0.5421,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9936]"

Super Micro Falls as Hindenburg Takes Aim With Short Report.csv,"Super Micro Computer Inc.'s shares took a hit on Tuesday following a short report from Hindenburg Research that questioned the company's financial practices and transparency. Hindenburg's report alleged significant accounting red flags, undisclosed related-party transactions, and potential violations of sanctions and export controls. Initially, the report caused Super Micro's stock to plummet by as much as 8.7%, but it later rebounded to close down 2.6%. The server manufacturer has been a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, with its high-performance servers in high demand for data centers. This surge in AI-related demand has driven significant growth for the company, doubling its revenue to $14.9 billion in the most recent fiscal year. Despite a steep decline from its March peak, Super Micro's stock remains up over 90% for the year, reflecting continued investor interest in the burgeoning AI sector. However, the Hindenburg report could intensify scrutiny on Super Micro's accounting practices and client relationships, particularly as the company has faced regulatory challenges in the past. In 2020, Super Micro resolved a U.S. SEC investigation by correcting its financial statements and paying a penalty for accounting issues from 2014 to 2017. As the AI market continues to expand, maintaining investor confidence will be crucial for Super Micro, especially amid concerns about the profitability of AI-optimized servers and the potential for increased regulatory oversight.

Technical Analysis Lesson - Reversal Day in Nvidia (NVDA).csv,"Every trader wants to know when the trend is changing from up to down or down to up. This happens when the leadership in the market changes from bulls to bears or bears to bulls. These trend changes are what every trader looks for. If they can accurately predict market turns, they can profit. That’s why they do what they do. Sometimes this change of leadership is slow and takes a long period of time to happen. These changes have price action that tends to show up on a chart as a ‘Rounded Top’ or ‘Rounded Bottom’ pattern. Sometimes the reversal is abrupt and takes place over a few time periods. This action tends to show up on a chart as a ‘V’ or ‘Inverted V’ reversal. But sometimes the trend changes just in one day... These dynamics can show up on a chart as a ‘Reversal Day’ pattern. One may have just happened in the stock of Nivida (NVDA). The Western world would call it an ‘Outside Reversal Day’. In candlestick terminology, it is called a ‘Bearish Engulfing Pattern’. It’s important to note that these candlestick patterns are at least 700 years old. They were developed by Japanese rice traders. It shows that the human nature which is illustrated in charts hasn’t changed. The name doesn’t matter. The action that it illustrates does. On Friday morning, it looked as though the uptrend in NVDA was going to continue for yet another day. It opened at a higher price than Thursday’s close. But then the tide turned… Over the day, the sellers came out of the woodwork. And not only did they hold off the assault. They overpowered the buyers and eventually pushed the price much lower. Importantly, Friday’s closing price was lower than Thursday’s opening price. This is frequently a characteristic of a trend that is reversing. Sometimes the change of leadership from bulls to bears happens over an extended time-period. But sometimes it occurs in just one day. That could be the case here.",0.5201,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9938]"

Yes the stock is expensive right now, but given the growth opportunity I would argue there is still plenty of room for expansion. Yes, China is a threat, but something tells me that China would not dare suffer the economic sanctions western nations would impose if they made a move in Taiwan.

TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand.csv,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

Whenever i see them in the market, if NVIDIA is up 3%, they are up 6%, but if NVIDIA is down 3%, they are down 6-7%. Is it still a buy even though it has risen almost 50% this year?

Understand this about INTC.csv,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9999]"

I looked up a few sources and it seems like they use the term shares outstanding and free float market cap. I think free float market cap is the free float times the share price , if it is why bother coming up with the term free float market cap. why not just use market cap instead? If the value of free float market cap is free float times share price, then what value do the shares outstanding have since we calculate free float times share price and not shares outstanding times share price? Free float and shares outstanding is a count of shares and free float market cap is the total value of shares?",0.5483,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9968]"

Why am I bullish on SFY instead of SPY.csv,"A comparison analysis between the holdings of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY), I have compiled information from the most recent available data. Below is a table showing the top 10 holdings for each ETF along with their percentage weight in the respective ETFs. This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings: Data Sources: SPY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Schwab, Yahoo Finance. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST) SFY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Zacks.com, Yahoo Finance. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST) Key Observations: Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting. It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation. I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors: Expense Ratio: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. Stock Selection Methodology: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. Performance Trends: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. Portfolio Diversification: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. Market Positioning: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. Innovative Approach of SoFi: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy. It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.

"Why Are Analysts Increasing NVIDIA’s Price Target Is It Out of Fear That Something Bad Will Happen, .csv","NVIDIA, often considered the heart of AI stocks, has recently been in the spotlight as analysts uniformly raise their stock targets. To me, this trend seems somewhat peculiar, even considering the current earnings season. The buoyant optimism surrounding the stock’s potential rise is sparking doubt in my mind. Should the stock underperform, it will be a litmus test of these analysts’ sincerity, raising questions about whether they may be manipulating public sentiment. In the broader context of the semiconductor sector, the recent quarterly earnings have been largely underwhelming. Yet, all semiconductor stocks appear to be buoyed by NVIDIA’s momentum. A stumble in NVIDIA’s stock could trigger a broader tech market downfall, while success could reignite a bullish trend for tech stocks. My intuition, however, leans towards a potential disappointment. NVIDIA might surpass current estimates but simultaneously lower their future guidance due to sluggish growth. Should this occur, a significant drop in stock price could follow. Disclaimer: These thoughts are purely my own observations and should not be taken as financial advice.",0.542,"['NEGATIVE', 0.9983]"

Worse case scenario the perfect Bear cocktail.csv,"After reading all the comments from my last post and doing some more thinking. I decided to entertain the idea of what would be the perfect Bear cocktail that could trigger a Stock Market destabilization. I'm not taking into account any type of positive news. I'm simply going the negative route, in a slow and systematic manner, without any huge trigger events. What am I missing and at what dates that's important and could also add to this? If you notice in the prior post list, three out of six times... rising interest rates were part of the cause that brought the market down at least 20%. Oil price shocks two out of 6. Then there´s speculative investments at the dotcom bubble. Covid, overvaluation, trade tensions... Stagflation. So these have to be in the mix one way or another: Cocktail Potential Ingredients: Rising interest rates. Oil price shocks. Speculative tech investments. Overvaluation. Trade tensions. Stagflation. New round of Covid-19. Housing or Commercial Real Estate Bubble. So this is the speculative worse case scenario we could have without going as far as having a WWIII: February 13, 2024: CPI report comes in hot. S&P500 comes down 1.5%, some buy the tiny dip. February 15, 2024: Jobless claims rise. Doesn't alter the market but adds to the cocktail mix. February 16, 2024: A higher-than-expected PPI indicates increasing costs at the producer level, which can signal rising inflationary pressures. Producers might pass these higher costs onto consumers, leading to an increase in consumer prices and overall inflation. The Fed to consider tightening monetary policy more aggressively than previously anticipated to combat inflation. This could include raising interest rates or adjusting the pace of tapering asset purchases. Financial markets don't react negatively to a higher-than-expected PPI, as it they priced it in from the CPI report. February 21, 2024: Nvidia posts earnings, they actually do fine but investors realize that´s gonna be the ceiling for now so the stock falls 15%. Other tech stocks get stained by the fear, bringing the S&P500 2.5% lower. AI investment sentiments leans towards potentially speculative for now.

Currently at 4,600... 7.5% below all time highs. May 1, 2024: FOMC Meeting leaves a bad taste in mouth. Jerome shifts narrative towards not lowering interests rates yet. Market falls another 2.5% on the bad sentiment. May 15, 2024: Situations in the Middle East, such as tensions in Gaza or Iran, could impact global oil supplies by affecting regional stability and energy infrastructure. Saudi Arabia, a key OPEC member, might alter its oil production strategy in response to shifts in global politics, economic pressures, or changes in energy demand. Actions perceived as irrational could stem from strategic decisions to protect national interests, influence oil prices, or respond to international events. S&P500 falls 0.5%.

AMD to acquire server builder ZT Systems for 49 billion in cash and stock.csv,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced on Monday its plans to acquire server manufacturer ZT Systems for $4.9 billion, as part of its strategy to bolster its portfolio of artificial intelligence (AI) chips and hardware, and to compete more effectively against Nvidia. The acquisition will be financed with 75% cash and the remaining in stock, leveraging AMD’s $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments reported in the second quarter. The rising demands of AI computing have necessitated the use of thousands of interconnected chips to achieve the required processing power, making the design and construction of server systems increasingly critical. This acquisition will enable AMD to enhance its capabilities in this area. According to AMD CEO Lisa Su, the addition of ZT Systems’ engineers will accelerate the company’s ability to test and deploy its latest AI GPUs on a scale required by major cloud computing companies like Microsoft. Although AMD plans to incorporate ZT Systems into its operations, it has no intention of competing directly in the server manufacturing market. Instead, the company plans to divest its server manufacturing business after the acquisition is finalized, with no discussions yet held with potential buyers. ZT Systems CEO Frank Zhang will join AMD, reporting to Forrest Norrod, AMD’s data center chief.

AMZN Earnings Preview- What to watch for tonight.csv,"Earnings from Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. will be crucial in guiding the Nasdaq 100 after a volatile period marked by extreme fluctuations. As the last megacaps to release results before Nvidia Corp. in August, these reports will set the tone for tech investors, particularly focusing on how artificial intelligence is driving growth in Amazon’s cloud-computing unit and boosting demand for Apple's next iPhone. The results will also provide valuable insights into the health of consumer spending, with Amazon shares already up about 25% this year. Amazon.com Inc. is set to release its Q2 earnings report after the market closes, with a conference call scheduled for 5:30 p.m. ET. Analysts project the company will report revenue of $148.8 billion, marking an 11% increase year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up from 65 cents in the same period last year. Amazon has guided for Q2 operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, signaling strong performance despite broader economic challenges. Key metrics expected by analysts include AWS revenue at nearly $26 billion, representing more than 17% year-over-year growth, and advertising revenue projected to reach $13 billion, a 21.7% increase from last year. The Stores segment, bolstered by events like Prime Day, is anticipated to show significant activity, while improvements in operating margins, especially in the North America segment, will be closely watched. Analysts also expect updates on AI initiatives and the overall capital expenditures for the year. Comments from analysts emphasize the importance of AI and cloud services for Amazon's future growth. Citi analysts, led by Ronald Josey, anticipate AWS revenue growth accelerated in Q2 due to generative AI tailwinds, while also predicting a beat in operating income thanks to improved retail efficiencies and strong advertising demand. Truist analyst Youssef Squali highlights Amazon's ability to gain share in global e-commerce and sees multiple growth vectors powering the company's continued expansion. Retail performance and consumer spending trends will be significant indicators, especially given mixed reports this earnings season. Analysts like Matt Stucky of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management note the importance of Amazon's retail margin expansion and its impact on profitability. Additionally, the potential for a surprise dividend announcement is a point of interest, as Amazon remains the last major tech company without a dividend program. Amazon's Q2 results will follow earnings reports from key competitors like Microsoft and Google, both of which had mixed receptions based on their cloud and AI performances. Wall Street's current focus is on tangible returns from AI investments, making Amazon's updates on its AI initiatives and AWS growth crucial for investor sentiment. The company's dominant position in the cloud market and ongoing efforts to enhance its e-commerce offerings will be under the microscope. Amazon saw its stock rise following a strong Q1 earnings report, showcasing impressive upside in both EPS and revenue. The standout metric was a significant 221% year-over-year increase in operating income to $15.31 billion, far surpassing the prior guidance of $8-12 billion. The company’s guidance for Q2 operating income of $10-14 billion also exceeded expectations. The Stores segment performed well, driven by successful shopping events like Amazon's Spring Deal Days in Europe and the first Big Spring Sale in Canada and the US. Faster delivery times, enhanced by regionalization efforts and cost-saving measures such as consolidating units into fewer boxes, boosted customer purchase frequency and overall spend. Additionally, Amazon is preparing for its 10th Prime Day event in July, which is expected to further drive sales. Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the highlight of the quarter, with a 17% growth in constant currency, an improvement from previous quarters. AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue business, with significant growth in both generative and non-generative AI workloads. The Advertising Services segment also showed robust growth, with a 24% increase in revenue to $11.82 billion, driven primarily by sponsored ads and early gains in Prime Video ads. Despite guiding Q2 revenue below consensus due to foreign exchange impacts, the strong performance in AWS and advertising has left investors optimistic.",0.5699,POSITIVE,0.9923

ATH  Leverage  Index Funds and more.csv,"I got a few questions as a newbie Some of the companies I want to invest long-term are either at their ATH or close to ATH, like Microsoft or Nvidia. I'm wondering whether I should wait for it to drop, because most of the stock market is green this year, so I have a feeling it may drop since it grew so much, what do you think? Some of it just recovered from 2022 to it's pre-2022 state, but Nvidia has 205% growth this year, which is crazy Index funds - the legendary S&P 500. Everyone says it's the most stable etc - but I've found other indexes with even better growth. SP500 usually have the 7-10% yearly return and last 5 years went up 56%, but for example the INDEX Vanguard Growth ETF went up 87% for the last 5 years - and it was also a steady growth, not a lucky spike during one period. What do you think, is it really smart to go with SP500 or are there other ones that are much better, even tho SP500 is so hyped by everyone? and if you agree - what other indexes with better return would you recommend? Leverage - I'm not familiar with how much can you leverage in stocks, but for people that invest in the top 10, which most likely will go up in the future, wouldn't be smarter to invest it with i.e 5x leverage, since the companies like Microsoft are stable, and eventually will grow? Stock Math - let's say I invest $10.000 in a stock and it declines -50%. I know have $5.000. If it goes up by 50%, do I get $7.500 or do I get my $10.000 back? Logically the first answer, but something doesn't give me a peace of mind here, so I prefer to ask Eli Lilly - what do you think about this stock? Growed massive amount lately, and pharmaceutical industry will definitely be there in 5 or 10 years.",0.5565,NEGATIVE,0.9857

The shares were up 0.8% to $696,502.02 on Wednesday, allowing it to top the $1 trillion mark, per FactSet. The milestone “is a testament to the firm’s financial strength and franchise value,” said Cathy Seifert, Berkshire analyst at CFRA Research. “This is significant at a time when Berkshire represents one of the few remaining conglomerates in existence today.” Unlike the six other companies in the trillion-dollar club (Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta), Berkshire is known for its old-economy focus as the owner of BNSF Railway, Geico Insurance and Dairy Queen.

Fundamentals behind a USA market drop this week & some positives.csv,"The problem areas in the USA: -------------------------- *- The Schiller PE is at a very high level. Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble. So stocks are highly expensive. *- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022! We are more of a service economy than a goods economy, *- World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle. That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local sales declines are offset. Additionally the trade war hampers both sides. *- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels. *- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers. You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term. People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank. However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials. AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth. AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales. So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia. This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW. I don't own any MKSI. This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording. So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN. Good areas: -------------------------------------- *- Labor productivity is up consistently since Q3 2022. one can see tradingeconomics dot com USA productivity *- Gasoline is lower than last year *- Retail sales are going fine, [ per a recent NPR radio article ] Nuetral ---------------------------------------- *- Labor force participation is not higher than Sept 2023. No more sales growth from people returning to work. Participation is up recently. tradingeconomics has this info. *- Consumer confidence is still down since January 2020.

Liz Ann Sonders, Chief Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab, pointed out that beneath the surface, the average stock in the Nasdaq has experienced a 37% drawdown, compared to the 7% maximum drawdown of the index from its year-to-date high. This suggests significant churn and rotation not visible when solely looking at index level changes. Further, the share of S&P 500 members trading above their 50-day moving average has dropped below 50%, while the index itself continues to trade above its intermediate-term average by more than 4%.

HPE Undervalued Tech Giant on the Rise!.csv,"I'm excited to share some incredible updates and insights about Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) that could make it a standout investment opportunity in the tech space. Key Growth Points: Innovative Financial as a Service (IFaaS): HPE's IFaaS is experiencing explosive growth, with an annual revenue rate soaring at 39%. This innovative service model is quickly becoming a cornerstone of HPE's strategy, driving substantial recurring revenue. AI Systems Revenue: AI is the future, and HPE is at the forefront. Their AI systems revenue has more than doubled from Q1 to Q2, hitting an impressive $900 million. This rapid growth underscores HPE's strong positioning in the AI market. Massive AI Systems Orders: The cumulative orders for HPE’s AI systems have reached a staggering $4.6 billion, maintaining a robust double-digit quarterly growth pace. This is a clear indicator of the high demand and trust in HPE’s AI solutions. Cutting-Edge Liquid Cooling Technology: HPE holds over 300 patents in the area of direct liquid cooling. This technology is crucial for managing the power demands of accelerated compute silicon designs, making HPE a leader in sustainable and efficient computing solutions. Strategic Partnership with NVIDIA (NVDA): HPE's collaboration with NVIDIA enhances their AI capabilities and product offerings. This partnership further solidifies HPE's position in the high-performance computing and AI markets. Valuation Compared to Peers: Despite these impressive metrics, HPE is significantly undervalued. It’s trading at just 8 times revenue, compared to Dell’s 19 times. This discrepancy highlights a potential for substantial upside as the market recognizes HPE's value. Why HPE? HPE is not just another tech company; it's a powerhouse of innovation and growth. Their strategic focus on AI, IFaaS, and advanced cooling technologies is driving significant revenue increases and solidifying their market position. As the tech landscape evolves, HPE is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends and deliver outstanding returns to investors. Conclusion: HPE's growth story is compelling and their current undervaluation offers a unique investment opportunity. With a strong trajectory in AI, IFaaS, and liquid cooling technology, HPE is poised to deliver exceptional value. If you’re looking for a tech stock with solid fundamentals and growth potential, HPE should definitely be on your radar.",0.5592,POSITIVE,0.9995

This approach can be used more effectively for complex tasks such as mathematics and coding to optimize reasoning performance. Hardware Demand Shift: Market demand is likely to shift from large-scale pre-training clusters to inference clouds as new technologies reduce parameter requirements. This will weaken NVIDIA's monopoly in the training chip market, and the inference chip market may see more competition, especially as companies such as Groq may fill the new demand. Capital Trends: Venture capital organizations are highly concerned about this change, and are gradually investing more resources in distributed inference clouds to cater to the distributed server needs of inference computing.",0.5346,POSITIVE,0.6048

Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,NEGATIVE,0.9443

I’ve been covering the tech space for 13 years and tracking Nvidia for even longer. I built my first desktop PC with an Nvidia graphics card in high school and have continued using its products ever since. Now I, like everyone else, am focused on Nvidia’s AI efforts, from reporting on how they’re dealing with the threat of increased competition to attending the company’s GTC conference to chatting with CEO Jensen Huang alongside my colleague Julie Hyman. With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia’s chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like AMD are gaining steam, and Nvidia’s own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant. How that plays out over the next few years is anyone’s guess.

Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&P 500 gains.csv,"= just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing = The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023 https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9 The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions. It’s an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve’s inflation battle, noted FactSet’s Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post. The 10 top performing days for the S&P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%. The S&P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday’s close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%. Through Dec. 22, the S&P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%. Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said. That didn’t mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote. Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found. Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July. The strategy “indicates the Fed’s measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,” Jakobsen said. The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks’ bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group’s announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering. SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a “mini” banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown. Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks — Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78% , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, 0.16%, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%, Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%, Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%, and Meta Platforms Inc. META, 0.56%. See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024? Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind. The S&P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted. In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high: The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&P 500’s weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted. Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&P 500’s overall return, he wrote, with the company’s success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.",0.5482,NEGATIVE,0.9995
Mega-caps vs small caps.csv,"The current state of the stock market exhibits a stark contrast between the performance of mega-cap and small-cap stocks, as investors grapple with mixed signals from major corporations and broader market indices.  Recent developments have highlighted this divide, with Microsoft's upcoming earnings report set to further shape the narrative. Mega-Cap Weakness and Market Impact Microsoft, a key player in the technology sector, is set to report its earnings after the market close, and its performance could significantly influence investor sentiment.  The recent underperformance of large-cap stocks like Merck and Procter & Gamble, both of which have disappointed with earnings guidance, has contributed to the Nasdaq Composite's (-0.9%) and S&P 500's (-0.4%) downward pressure.  This weakness is reflected in the Vanguard Mega-Cap Growth ETF (MGK), which is down 1.1%. Small-Cap Resilience In contrast, small-cap stocks have shown relative strength, with the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 Value Index posting gains.  The equal-weighted S&P 500 is also holding its own, indicating that smaller companies are providing a stabilizing force in the market.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, buoyed by the financials and energy sectors, adds to this resilience. Sectors in Focus The IT sector, weighed down by NVIDIA's (-5.0%) decline ahead of AMD's earnings release, is leading the pack of losers.  Consumer staples, also negatively impacted, are lagging behind. On the other hand, financials, and energy sectors are posting gains, offering a glimmer of hope for investors seeking opportunities. Treasuries and Market Sentiment The Treasury market remains relatively calm, with the 2-yr note yield down to 4.38% and the 10-yr note yield at 4.17%.  Economic indicators, such as the better-than-expected consumer confidence index and the Bank of Japan's policy decision, have not sparked significant market movements, suggesting that investors are cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's FOMC decision on Wednesday. As we await Microsoft's earnings report, the stock market's divide between mega-cap and small-cap stocks is a cause for concern, especially for those relying on large-cap performance.  However, the resilience of small-cap companies and select sectors is providing a silver lining.

MSFT faces long-term potential disadvantages.csv,"I think one of the main reasons Microsoft is a great long-term investment is its long history of generating a lot of free cash flow. At the time of writing, the company's free cash flow margin is over 30%, with free cash flow rising from $15.9 billion in 2009 to $74.1 billion in the last 12 months. This financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments. While Microsoft may not seem like a value investment, in my opinion, its pricing is reasonable given its continued revenue and earnings growth, and it's likely to continue for the foreseeable future. I estimate EPS growth of 13% on a regular basis over the next 12 months. Based on this projection, I have a price target of $482.40 and estimate that the stock will trade at a non-GAAP P/E ratio of around 36. Looking ahead, I expect Microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15% over the next 5 to 10 years. While this prospect necessitates buying the stock at a fair valuation, I believe the current price provides an opportunity. The company's forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is only 6.5% above its five-year average, while its forward diluted earnings per share growth rate is nearly the same at 5.8%. MSFT faces long-term potential headwinds One potential challenge to Microsoft's long-term growth in AI is that its adoption can be cyclical. Currently, the demand for AI systems is high, which has prompted Microsoft and other big tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion. However, when the current trend peaks (likely due to macroeconomic constraints), growth may slow. According to the TipRanks risk analysis tool, Microsoft is exposed to 32% risk from legal and regulatory factors, which is higher than the industry average and could impact its AI operations due to increased scrutiny of data privacy and AI governance. Given this outlook, I expect some volatility in Microsoft's long-term growth trajectory, although it may not be as good as NVIDIA NVDA -0.06% ▼ and so on semiconductor companies so obvious. As market sentiment fluctuates, cyclical price and valuation declines coincide with temporarily lower growth rates and may provide more attractive buying opportunities. There is also a risk that Microsoft and other Big Tech players could over-invest in AI infrastructure. With 21% of its risk related to Tech & Innovation, Microsoft’s heavy investment in AI-driven initiatives, including data center infrastructure, could result in lower-than-expected returns if industry growth does not meet expectations. This may impact free cash flow margins in the medium term, contributing to further volatility.",0.5607,NEGATIVE,0.8794

The demand for its AI GPUs remains high, the company has been receiving upward revisions recently, and its stock is trading around its all-time high levels with a potential to appreciate even further in the upcoming months.

Nvidia announces 50 billion stock buyback.csv,"Nvidia said Wednesday that its board of directors has approved a $50 billion stock buyback. The computer chip giant announced the share repurchase as part of its fiscal second-quarter earnings, in which it reported earnings and guidance that surpassed Wall Street expectations. Nvidia returned $15.4 billion to shareholders in share repurposes and cash dividends as part of the company’s first half of its fiscal 2025. The company said it had $7.5 billion remaining under its share repurchase plan, as of the end of its fiscal second quarter. Last year, Nvidia announced a $25 billion share buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results. Companies often experience a boom to their stock price after revealing stock buyback plans. In May, for instance, Apple announced a $110 billion stock buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results that showed overall sales fell 4% year over year and iPhone sales dropped 10% year over year. However, the iPhone maker’s shares rose 7% in after-hours trading, likely because Apple’s share buyback was the biggest in corporate history. With Nvidia’s shares dropping 4% in extended trading despite reporting solid financial results and announcing a stock buyback, some experts believe the company has been doing so well that it is getting harder to impress investors.

Nvidia More Room to Run Just Getting Started.csv,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they’ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don’t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical. Yes, Nvidia’s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn’t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now. Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn’t possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia’s place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn’t happened and Nvidia’s only gotten stronger. That’s not to say over time Nvidia won’t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it’s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution. Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations.

Lowe's, BJ's Wholesale Club, and Peloton are also set to announce earnings this week. August is shaping up to be the worst month for stocks this year, with all three main averages closing last week lower after a hawkish read of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting sent equities lower and Treasury rates higher in the second half of the week. Economic data continues to come in stronger than expected, with the July retail sales report indicating a 0.7% increase in sales for the month, about double what economists forecast. The AtlantaFed's GDPNow projection now predicts third-quarter GDP growth of 5.8%, the strongest rate since the fourth quarter of 2021.

Qualcomm Approached Intel About a Takeover in Recent Days.csv,"Qualcomm recently approached Intel with a takeover proposal, marking what could be one of the largest tech deals in recent memory, according to sources. Intel, once valued at over $290 billion, has seen its market cap fall to around $90 billion after a challenging year in which its shares dropped 60%. While a deal is far from guaranteed, Qualcomm’s interest comes as Intel struggles to recover under CEO Pat Gelsinger’s turnaround plan, which has yet to deliver significant results. Should Intel be receptive, the deal could face heavy antitrust scrutiny, though some argue it might bolster U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor industry. Qualcomm may consider offloading parts of Intel to complete the acquisition. Both companies have sought to capitalize on the AI boom, though they’ve lagged behind Nvidia. Intel, grappling with factory delays and cost-cutting measures, is receiving government subsidies as part of its efforts to build chip factories. A Qualcomm takeover could enhance its portfolio by adding Intel’s dominance in PCs and servers to its smartphone chip business.

RYCEY do you believe in this company.csv,"Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC (LSE:RR.) shares have risen three-fold in little more than a year, but there is still a bit more to go according to Citigroup, which has raised its share price target to 555p. “Positive sentiment will help the continued rerating, driven by accelerating wide body cycle (only a few delivery slots before 2030 for the A350 and 2028 for the A330),” said the bank.

S&P 20 years ago versus today Via @alerts on IG.csv,2004: Walmart ExxonMobil Chevron Citi IBM General Electric GM Ford 2024: Microsoft (7.84%) Apple (6.83%) Nvidia (3.8%) Alphabet (3.72%) Amazon (3.5%) Meta (2.1%) Berkshire Hathaway (1.71%) Broadcom (1.28%) Interesting to see the discrepancies and differences in the top eight from 2004 compared to the top eight from 2024. Not exactly surprising to see these giants at the top of the list. The year is 2044... does the top eight look relatively similar to what it looks like now? Feels hard to argue otherwise. Then again they probably said similar things in 2004. It just seems like GAFAM will continue to purchase any successful companies of smaller size.

Serious question from someone who took a four-year trading break.csv,Hey everyone After a long long hiatus and licking my wounds I decided to try trading once again. Recently I've been changing up my approach and doing 5-7 DTE spy options. And it's been going pretty decent however recently I got a couple of August 30th calls for Nvidia I managed to get in at a good position for 133 calls. My thesis is that it's going to keep pumping up to the day of earnings. I don't have any intention of holding the position up until expiration. My question is regarding theta decay and volatility. I know that the closer I got to the expiration the less profit I'll see as a percentage of my position. And I also understand that during high levels of volatility it can go both ways. And I'm not really asking for specific advice just kind of guidance or knowledge as to how that may affect my position. I'm holding them over the weekend and I'm expecting Monday to start off a little red but to finish off green and so I'm not quite sure if I want to sell half my positions and wait till earnings or if I should wait to earnings in general. I strongly believe that Nvidia is going to beat their earnings I just don't know how drastically that's going to affect the price action. Any and all input is definitely appreciated Thanks in advance,0.5421,NEGATIVE,0.9936

Super Micro Falls as Hindenburg Takes Aim With Short Report.csv,"Super Micro Computer Inc.'s shares took a hit on Tuesday following a short report from Hindenburg Research that questioned the company's financial practices and transparency. Hindenburg's report alleged significant accounting red flags, undisclosed related-party transactions, and potential violations of sanctions and export controls. Initially, the report caused Super Micro's stock to plummet by as much as 8.7%, but it later rebounded to close down 2.6%. The server manufacturer has been a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, with its high-performance servers in high demand for data centers. This surge in AI-related demand has driven significant growth for the company, doubling its revenue to $14.9 billion in the most recent fiscal year. Despite a steep decline from its March peak, Super Micro's stock remains up over 90% for the year, reflecting continued investor interest in the burgeoning AI sector. However, the Hindenburg report could intensify scrutiny on Super Micro's accounting practices and client relationships, particularly as the company has faced regulatory challenges in the past. In 2020, Super Micro resolved a U.S. SEC investigation by correcting its financial statements and paying a penalty for accounting issues from 2014 to 2017. As the AI market continues to expand, maintaining investor confidence will be crucial for Super Micro, especially amid concerns about the profitability of AI-optimized servers and the potential for increased regulatory oversight.

Technical Analysis Lesson - Reversal Day in Nvidia (NVDA).csv,"Every trader wants to know when the trend is changing from up to down or down to up. This happens when the leadership in the market changes from bulls to bears or bears to bulls. These trend changes are what every trader looks for. If they can accurately predict market turns, they can profit. That’s why they do what they do. Sometimes this change of leadership is slow and takes a long period of time to happen. These changes have price action that tends to show up on a chart as a ‘Rounded Top’ or ‘Rounded Bottom’ pattern. Sometimes the reversal is abrupt and takes place over a few time periods. This action tends to show up on a chart as a ‘V’ or ‘Inverted V’ reversal. But sometimes the trend changes just in one day... These dynamics can show up on a chart as a ‘Reversal Day’ pattern. One may have just happened in the stock of Nivida (NVDA). The Western world would call it an ‘Outside Reversal Day’. In candlestick terminology, it is called a ‘Bearish Engulfing Pattern’. It’s important to note that these candlestick patterns are at least 700 years old. They were developed by Japanese rice traders. It shows that the human nature which is illustrated in charts hasn’t changed. The name doesn’t matter. The action that it illustrates does. On Friday morning, it looked as though the uptrend in NVDA was going to continue for yet another day. It opened at a higher price than Thursday’s close. But then the tide turned… Over the day, the sellers came out of the woodwork. And not only did they hold off the assault. They overpowered the buyers and eventually pushed the price much lower. Importantly, Friday’s closing price was lower than Thursday’s opening price. This is frequently a characteristic of a trend that is reversing. Sometimes the change of leadership from bulls to bears happens over an extended time-period. But sometimes it occurs in just one day. That could be the case here.",0.5201,NEGATIVE,0.9938

TSM investment.csv,"Does anyone have any opinions on if this is a good investment? Given the recent AI boom everyone is focused on big players such as NVIDIA and AMD, but they are both supplied heavily by TSM for their chips. I don’t see much competition for TSM given they are so far advanced ahead of any American or Chinese competitor, and given the only increase in demand for AI technology, I don’t see how they wouldn’t grow. Yes the stock is expensive right now, but given the growth opportunity I would argue there is still plenty of room for expansion. Yes, China is a threat, but something tells me that China would not dare suffer the economic sanctions western nations would impose if they made a move in Taiwan. Trump has said he would likely put tariffs on the Taiwan semiconductor industry in order to grow domestic production, but still with tariffs, I don’t see big players switching to alternatives, as the gap between TSM and alternatives is very large.

TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand.csv,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

They are also mass producing 3nm chips which is starting to make up a nice chunk of their revenue. My main concern is obviously china but also that they are too tied to nvidia. Whenever i see them in the market, if NVIDIA is up 3%, they are up 6%, but if NVIDIA is down 3%, they are down 6-7%. Is it still a buy even though it has risen almost 50% this year?

Understand this about INTC.csv,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Below is a table showing the top 10 holdings for each ETF along with their percentage weight in the respective ETFs. This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings: Data Sources: SPY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Schwab, Yahoo Finance. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST) SFY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Zacks.com, Yahoo Finance. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST) Key Observations: Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting. It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation. I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors: Expense Ratio: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. Stock Selection Methodology: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. Performance Trends: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. Portfolio Diversification: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. Market Positioning: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. Innovative Approach of SoFi: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy. It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.

"Why Are Analysts Increasing NVIDIA’s Price Target Is It Out of Fear That Something Bad Will Happen, .csv","NVIDIA, often considered the heart of AI stocks, has recently been in the spotlight as analysts uniformly raise their stock targets. To me, this trend seems somewhat peculiar, even considering the current earnings season. The buoyant optimism surrounding the stock’s potential rise is sparking doubt in my mind.

A stumble in NVIDIA’s stock could trigger a broader tech market downfall, while success could reignite a bullish trend for tech stocks.

I'm simply going the negative route, in a slow and systematic manner, without any huge trigger events. What am I missing and at what dates that's important and could also add to this? If you notice in the prior post list, three out of six times... rising interest rates were part of the cause that brought the market down at least 20%. Oil price shocks two out of 6. Then there´s speculative investments at the dotcom bubble. Covid, overvaluation, trade tensions... Stagflation. So these have to be in the mix one way or another: Cocktail Potential Ingredients: Rising interest rates. Oil price shocks. Speculative tech investments. Overvaluation. Trade tensions. Stagflation. New round of Covid-19. Housing or Commercial Real Estate Bubble. So this is the speculative worse case scenario we could have without going as far as having a WWIII: February 13, 2024: CPI report comes in hot. S&P500 comes down 1.5%, some buy the tiny dip. February 15, 2024: Jobless claims rise. Doesn't alter the market but adds to the cocktail mix. February 16, 2024: A higher-than-expected PPI indicates increasing costs at the producer level, which can signal rising inflationary pressures. Producers might pass these higher costs onto consumers, leading to an increase in consumer prices and overall inflation. The Fed to consider tightening monetary policy more aggressively than previously anticipated to combat inflation. This could include raising interest rates or adjusting the pace of tapering asset purchases. Financial markets don't react negatively to a higher-than-expected PPI, as it they priced it in from the CPI report. February 21, 2024: Nvidia posts earnings, they actually do fine but investors realize that´s gonna be the ceiling for now so the stock falls 15%. Other tech stocks get stained by the fear, bringing the S&P500 2.5% lower. AI investment sentiments leans towards potentially speculative for now. March 12, 2024: February´s CPI report comes in hot again, causing Algorithmic trades to sell and bring down the S&P500 another 2%. March 19-20, 2024: FOMC Meeting gives subtext of potentially not bringing interest rates down yet. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterates emphasis on the central bank's commitment to combating inflation, even if it requires keeping interest rates high for an extended period. This brings down the market sentiment down and numbers another 1%. April 5, 2024: In a CNBC YouTube video report, experts delve into the complexities of the current commercial real estate (CRE) market. The rise of remote work led to a decreased demand for office spaces, the pandemic trained people to make purchases online, commercial real estate bubble starts to show symptoms of cracking up. April 10, 2024: CPI report is on ambiguous. Not up, not down. Anything could happen at this point. Aprils report will define what the FED will do and the next 6 months of stock market activity. Market loses .5% April 17, 2024: Tom Lee's bullish perspective has been challenged by the prior events and during an interview he mentions that this was the turmoil he had been expecting but sees the S&P500 going back to 5,200 points by the end of the year. Currently at 4,600... 7.5% below all time highs. May 1, 2024: FOMC Meeting leaves a bad taste in mouth. Jerome shifts narrative towards not lowering interests rates yet. Market falls another 2.5% on the bad sentiment. May 15, 2024: Situations in the Middle East, such as tensions in Gaza or Iran, could impact global oil supplies by affecting regional stability and energy infrastructure. Saudi Arabia, a key OPEC member, might alter its oil production strategy in response to shifts in global politics, economic pressures, or changes in energy demand. Actions perceived as irrational could stem from strategic decisions to protect national interests, influence oil prices, or respond to international events. S&P500 falls 0.5%. July 8, 2024: A new wave of Covid-19 actually breaks through the collective deceit of it being over because death rates rise significantly and word spreads out again from hospital staff that's it's getting real bad. Stock market reacts in a mixed manner. Amazon and tech companies go up a little, small caps enter another bad rout. S&P500 falls 1%. July 20, 2024: Numbers start to confirm a Stagflation situation actually taking place. A significant slowdown in economic growth, rising unemployment rates, declining consumer spending, and a contraction in manufacturing. Inflation pressures, coupled with tightening monetary policies aimed at controlling price levels, contribute to decreased economic activity. Additionally, geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions serve as catalysts, further straining global markets. The interconnectedness of these factors in precipitate a recessionary environment. S&P500 falls .7%. July 23, 2024: Nvidia reports and disappoints, falls another 8% in tandem with other tech companies. July 25, 2024: Commercial Real Estate bubble pops and hits the news hard. S&P500 falls 1.4% At 13.6% the all time highs from January 2024. Currently at 4,400 points. August 14, 2024: After all the earnings reports it becomes increasingly clear: the FED won't lower rates and will keep them there for longer than expected; consumer spending is declining, companies keep firing people, the Bear narrative takes over. The S&P500 falls to 4,010 points. 23.5% below all time highs. It stays around here for the next 6 months, falls further and gets better by the end of 2025.",0.5298,NEGATIVE,1.0

Remember the partnership with Apple? 2. AMD’s Earnings Report: AMD has projected significant demand and growth, suggesting a positive trend. If AMD is experiencing this level of demand, it’s worth considering what Nvidia might be experiencing. AMD indicated no signs of slowing down in AI product demand through 2025 and beyond.

Quarterly Highlights: • Earnings per share: 69 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected • Revenue: $5.83 billion vs. $5.72 billion expected • Expected Q3 Sales: $6.7 billion vs. $6.61 billion expected Financial Performance: • Net Income: $265 million (16 cents per share) vs. $27 million (2 cents per share) YoY • Data Center Revenue: Grew 115% YoY to $2.8 billion, driven by AI chip sales (Instinct GPUs) • Client Segment (PCs): Rose 49% YoY to $1.5 billion, indicating a recovering PC market • Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% YoY, below the expected $676 million • Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% YoY, slightly above the expected $856 million AMD’s AI chip sales, reported under the Data Center segment, saw significant growth, highlighting the company’s efforts to compete with Nvidia. AMD’s MI300X AI chip aims to capture market share from Nvidia, which has seen its stock double this year due to high demand for AI GPUs.

Investors are focused on AMD’s ability to grow its AI business, with the company anticipating $4 billion in AI chip sales this year, accounting for 15% of its total expected sales. AMD’s core business in CPUs for laptops and servers and its growing AI chip segment position the company as a significant player in the evolving technology landscape.

AMD to acquire server builder ZT Systems for 49 billion in cash and stock.csv,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced on Monday its plans to acquire server manufacturer ZT Systems for $4.9 billion, as part of its strategy to bolster its portfolio of artificial intelligence (AI) chips and hardware, and to compete more effectively against Nvidia. The acquisition will be financed with 75% cash and the remaining in stock, leveraging AMD’s $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments reported in the second quarter. The rising demands of AI computing have necessitated the use of thousands of interconnected chips to achieve the required processing power, making the design and construction of server systems increasingly critical. This acquisition will enable AMD to enhance its capabilities in this area. According to AMD CEO Lisa Su, the addition of ZT Systems’ engineers will accelerate the company’s ability to test and deploy its latest AI GPUs on a scale required by major cloud computing companies like Microsoft. Although AMD plans to incorporate ZT Systems into its operations, it has no intention of competing directly in the server manufacturing market. Instead, the company plans to divest its server manufacturing business after the acquisition is finalized, with no discussions yet held with potential buyers. ZT Systems CEO Frank Zhang will join AMD, reporting to Forrest Norrod, AMD’s data center chief. The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2025, will see AMD retaining about 1,000 of ZT Systems' roughly 2,500 employees. AMD anticipates that the acquisition will positively impact its adjusted financial performance by the end of 2025.

AMZN Earnings Preview- What to watch for tonight.csv,"Earnings from Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. will be crucial in guiding the Nasdaq 100 after a volatile period marked by extreme fluctuations. As the last megacaps to release results before Nvidia Corp. in August, these reports will set the tone for tech investors, particularly focusing on how artificial intelligence is driving growth in Amazon’s cloud-computing unit and boosting demand for Apple's next iPhone. The results will also provide valuable insights into the health of consumer spending, with Amazon shares already up about 25% this year. Amazon.com Inc. is set to release its Q2 earnings report after the market closes, with a conference call scheduled for 5:30 p.m. ET. Analysts project the company will report revenue of $148.8 billion, marking an 11% increase year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up from 65 cents in the same period last year. Amazon has guided for Q2 operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, signaling strong performance despite broader economic challenges. Key metrics expected by analysts include AWS revenue at nearly $26 billion, representing more than 17% year-over-year growth, and advertising revenue projected to reach $13 billion, a 21.7% increase from last year. The Stores segment, bolstered by events like Prime Day, is anticipated to show significant activity, while improvements in operating margins, especially in the North America segment, will be closely watched. Analysts also expect updates on AI initiatives and the overall capital expenditures for the year. Comments from analysts emphasize the importance of AI and cloud services for Amazon's future growth. Citi analysts, led by Ronald Josey, anticipate AWS revenue growth accelerated in Q2 due to generative AI tailwinds, while also predicting a beat in operating income thanks to improved retail efficiencies and strong advertising demand. Truist analyst Youssef Squali highlights Amazon's ability to gain share in global e-commerce and sees multiple growth vectors powering the company's continued expansion. Retail performance and consumer spending trends will be significant indicators, especially given mixed reports this earnings season. Analysts like Matt Stucky of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management note the importance of Amazon's retail margin expansion and its impact on profitability. Additionally, the potential for a surprise dividend announcement is a point of interest, as Amazon remains the last major tech company without a dividend program. Amazon's Q2 results will follow earnings reports from key competitors like Microsoft and Google, both of which had mixed receptions based on their cloud and AI performances. Wall Street's current focus is on tangible returns from AI investments, making Amazon's updates on its AI initiatives and AWS growth crucial for investor sentiment. The company's dominant position in the cloud market and ongoing efforts to enhance its e-commerce offerings will be under the microscope. Amazon saw its stock rise following a strong Q1 earnings report, showcasing impressive upside in both EPS and revenue. The standout metric was a significant 221% year-over-year increase in operating income to $15.31 billion, far surpassing the prior guidance of $8-12 billion. The company’s guidance for Q2 operating income of $10-14 billion also exceeded expectations. The Stores segment performed well, driven by successful shopping events like Amazon's Spring Deal Days in Europe and the first Big Spring Sale in Canada and the US. Faster delivery times, enhanced by regionalization efforts and cost-saving measures such as consolidating units into fewer boxes, boosted customer purchase frequency and overall spend. Additionally, Amazon is preparing for its 10th Prime Day event in July, which is expected to further drive sales. Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the highlight of the quarter, with a 17% growth in constant currency, an improvement from previous quarters. AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue business, with significant growth in both generative and non-generative AI workloads. The Advertising Services segment also showed robust growth, with a 24% increase in revenue to $11.82 billion, driven primarily by sponsored ads and early gains in Prime Video ads. Despite guiding Q2 revenue below consensus due to foreign exchange impacts, the strong performance in AWS and advertising has left investors optimistic.",0.5699,POSITIVE,0.9923

Some of it just recovered from 2022 to it's pre-2022 state, but Nvidia has 205% growth this year, which is crazy Index funds - the legendary S&P 500. Everyone says it's the most stable etc - but I've found other indexes with even better growth. SP500 usually have the 7-10% yearly return and last 5 years went up 56%, but for example the INDEX Vanguard Growth ETF went up 87% for the last 5 years - and it was also a steady growth, not a lucky spike during one period. What do you think, is it really smart to go with SP500 or are there other ones that are much better, even tho SP500 is so hyped by everyone? and if you agree - what other indexes with better return would you recommend? Leverage - I'm not familiar with how much can you leverage in stocks, but for people that invest in the top 10, which most likely will go up in the future, wouldn't be smarter to invest it with i.e 5x leverage, since the companies like Microsoft are stable, and eventually will grow? Stock Math - let's say I invest $10.000 in a stock and it declines -50%. I know have $5.000. If it goes up by 50%, do I get $7.500 or do I get my $10.000 back?

Dell Earnings.csv,"I wanted to get everyone’s take on DELL (down nearly 11% after hours.) I bought 106 shares at 130.5 during their recent run.

The company seems solid, especially with its strength in enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure, even though consumer PC sales have been an ongoing problem. Despite this Dell has been doubling down on AI, data centers, and hybrid cloud, which I believe should set them up well for growth in 2025. They also stand to benefit from SMCI’s issues and Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure. With the growing focus on AI and enterprise tech, it feels like Dell could see steady, long-term growth and break out to that $150 range by Q2 2024. Thoughts? Should I continue to hold?

"Feds set stage for antitrust probes of Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI.csv","The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are nearing an agreement to divvy up investigations of potential anticompetitive conduct by some of the world’s largest technology companies in the artificial intelligence industry, according to three people with knowledge of the negotiations. As part of the arrangement, the DOJ is poised to investigate Nvidia and its leading position in supplying the high-end semiconductors underpinning AI computing, while the FTC is set to probe whether Microsoft, and its partner OpenAI, have unfair advantages with the rapidly evolving technology, particularly around the technology used for large language models. The three companies have been leaders in AI, with the technology powering Nvidia today to a $3 trillion market value, second only to Microsoft. The deal has been negotiated for nearly a year. And while leaders of both agencies have expressed urgency in ensuring that the rapidly growing artificial intelligence technology is not dominated by existing tech giants, until an agreement is finalized, there was very little investigative work they could do.

Fundamentals behind a USA market drop this week & some positives.csv,"The problem areas in the USA: -------------------------- *- The Schiller PE is at a very high level. Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble. So stocks are highly expensive. *- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022! We are more of a service economy than a goods economy, *- World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle. That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local sales declines are offset. Additionally the trade war hampers both sides. *- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels. *- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers. You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term. People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank. However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials. AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth. AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales. So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia. This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW. I don't own any MKSI. This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording. So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN. Good areas: -------------------------------------- *- Labor productivity is up consistently since Q3 2022. one can see tradingeconomics dot com USA productivity *- Gasoline is lower than last year *- Retail sales are going fine, [ per a recent NPR radio article ] Nuetral ---------------------------------------- *- Labor force participation is not higher than Sept 2023. No more sales growth from people returning to work. Participation is up recently. tradingeconomics has this info. *- Consumer confidence is still down since January 2020.

This divergence indicates that while the index appears strong, the underlying market health is weaker. Liz Ann Sonders, Chief Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab, pointed out that beneath the surface, the average stock in the Nasdaq has experienced a 37% drawdown, compared to the 7% maximum drawdown of the index from its year-to-date high. This suggests significant churn and rotation not visible when solely looking at index level changes. Further, the share of S&P 500 members trading above their 50-day moving average has dropped below 50%, while the index itself continues to trade above its intermediate-term average by more than 4%.

"Impacting NVDA is underlying logic,what does OpenAI is change in strategy mean.csv","Big model pre-training bottleneck: Silicon Valley AI labs are generally struggling with new model training, with OpenAI's Orion and Google's Gemini 2.0 failing to significantly outperform their predecessors, defying the “law of scaling”. This law used to mean that model performance would continue to increase with data and computation, but the scaling effect has now plateaued. Computing in the reasoning phase: To overcome pre-training bottlenecks, OpenAI and other labs are exploring “compute on test” techniques that enable human-like multi-step reasoning by allowing models to generate and evaluate multiple possibilities in real-time during the reasoning phase. This approach can be used more effectively for complex tasks such as mathematics and coding to optimize reasoning performance. Hardware Demand Shift: Market demand is likely to shift from large-scale pre-training clusters to inference clouds as new technologies reduce parameter requirements. This will weaken NVIDIA's monopoly in the training chip market, and the inference chip market may see more competition, especially as companies such as Groq may fill the new demand. Capital Trends: Venture capital organizations are highly concerned about this change, and are gradually investing more resources in distributed inference clouds to cater to the distributed server needs of inference computing.",0.5346,POSITIVE,0.6048

The high cost of chip manufacturing and R&D, coupled with the uncertain global economic landscape, poses significant challenges. The company’s ability to execute its ambitious plans while maintaining financial stability is a key factor to watch in the coming years. Recent Financials: Intel Corporation’s recent financial performance reflects the challenges and resilience of a tech giant in a volatile market. In Q3 2023, the company reported a total revenue of $14.2 billion, a decrease of 8% from the same quarter in the previous year. This decline was primarily due to decreases in revenue across its major segments: the Client Computing Group (CCG) revenue decreased by 3%, the Data Center and AI Group (DCAI) by 10%, and the Network and Edge Group (NEX) by a significant 32%. The company’s financial strategy also reflects a commitment to operational efficiency and cost management. By streamlining processes and optimizing resources, Intel aims to improve its profitability and shareholder value in the long term. This approach is crucial as the company faces intense competition from other tech giants and emerging players in the semiconductor industry. In conclusion, Intel’s recent financial performance, though marked by challenges, showcases the company’s strategic efforts to remain a dominant player in the tech industry. The company’s focus on innovation, operational efficiency, and market adaptability will be key to its future success and financial stability. Financial Bullet Points: Revenue (Q3 2023): $14.2 billion, down 8% YoY. Client Computing Group Revenue: Decreased by 3%. Data Center and AI Group Revenue: Decreased by 10%. Network and Edge Group Revenue: Decreased by 32%. Gross Margin (Q3 2023): 42.5%, slightly down from 42.6% YoY. Net Income (Q3 2023): $297 million, a substantial decline from $1.019 billion YoY. Earnings Per Share (Q3 2023): $0.07, with non-GAAP EPS at $0.41. Business Model & Competitors Analysis: Intel’s business model revolves around its dominance in CPUs, with expansion into data center solutions, IoT, and AI.

Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,NEGATIVE,0.9443

Hi! I’m Dan Howley, the tech editor at Yahoo Finance, and Nvidia has seemingly been at the forefront of virtually everything I’ve covered since ChatGPT hit the scene in 2022. I’ve been covering the tech space for 13 years and tracking Nvidia for even longer. I built my first desktop PC with an Nvidia graphics card in high school and have continued using its products ever since. Now I, like everyone else, am focused on Nvidia’s AI efforts, from reporting on how they’re dealing with the threat of increased competition to attending the company’s GTC conference to chatting with CEO Jensen Huang alongside my colleague Julie Hyman. With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia’s chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like AMD are gaining steam, and Nvidia’s own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant. How that plays out over the next few years is anyone’s guess. In today’s fiscal 2025 third quarter earnings report, Nvidia beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines on the strength of sales of its high-powered AI chips. 💵 Revenue: $35.08B vs $33.2B expected 💲 Adjusted EPS: $0.81 vs $0.74 expected 💾 Data center revenue: $30.8B vs $29B expected Nvidia also said it anticipates revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, for the fiscal fourth quarter. That's just ahead of Wall Street expectations of $37 billion. I’ll be back tomorrow, Nov. 21, at 10 a.m. ET to answer your questions about Nvidia’s latest earnings, the market reaction, and where the stock goes from here. That does it for me for today.

Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&P 500 gains.csv,"= just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing = The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023 https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9 The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions. It’s an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve’s inflation battle, noted FactSet’s Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post. The 10 top performing days for the S&P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%. The S&P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday’s close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%. Through Dec. 22, the S&P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%. Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said. That didn’t mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote. Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found. Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July. The strategy “indicates the Fed’s measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,” Jakobsen said. The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks’ bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group’s announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering. SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a “mini” banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown. Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks — Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78% , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, 0.16%, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%, Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%, Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%, and Meta Platforms Inc. META, 0.56%. See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024? Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind. The S&P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted. In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high: The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&P 500’s weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted. Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&P 500’s overall return, he wrote, with the company’s success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.",0.5482,NEGATIVE,0.9995
Mega-caps vs small caps.csv,"The current state of the stock market exhibits a stark contrast between the performance of mega-cap and small-cap stocks, as investors grapple with mixed signals from major corporations and broader market indices.  Recent developments have highlighted this divide, with Microsoft's upcoming earnings report set to further shape the narrative. Mega-Cap Weakness and Market Impact Microsoft, a key player in the technology sector, is set to report its earnings after the market close, and its performance could significantly influence investor sentiment.  The recent underperformance of large-cap stocks like Merck and Procter & Gamble, both of which have disappointed with earnings guidance, has contributed to the Nasdaq Composite's (-0.9%) and S&P 500's (-0.4%) downward pressure.  This weakness is reflected in the Vanguard Mega-Cap Growth ETF (MGK), which is down 1.1%. Small-Cap Resilience In contrast, small-cap stocks have shown relative strength, with the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 Value Index posting gains.  The equal-weighted S&P 500 is also holding its own, indicating that smaller companies are providing a stabilizing force in the market.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, buoyed by the financials and energy sectors, adds to this resilience. Sectors in Focus The IT sector, weighed down by NVIDIA's (-5.0%) decline ahead of AMD's earnings release, is leading the pack of losers.  Consumer staples, also negatively impacted, are lagging behind. On the other hand, financials, and energy sectors are posting gains, offering a glimmer of hope for investors seeking opportunities. Treasuries and Market Sentiment The Treasury market remains relatively calm, with the 2-yr note yield down to 4.38% and the 10-yr note yield at 4.17%.  Economic indicators, such as the better-than-expected consumer confidence index and the Bank of Japan's policy decision, have not sparked significant market movements, suggesting that investors are cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's FOMC decision on Wednesday. As we await Microsoft's earnings report, the stock market's divide between mega-cap and small-cap stocks is a cause for concern, especially for those relying on large-cap performance.  However, the resilience of small-cap companies and select sectors is providing a silver lining. Investors should stay vigilant, monitor market reactions to key earnings releases, and consider a diversified portfolio that takes into account the current market dynamics.  The Federal Reserve's decision will likely play a crucial role in determining the market's next course of action.",0.5419,NEGATIVE,0.9136

MSFT faces long-term potential disadvantages.csv,"I think one of the main reasons Microsoft is a great long-term investment is its long history of generating a lot of free cash flow. At the time of writing, the company's free cash flow margin is over 30%, with free cash flow rising from $15.9 billion in 2009 to $74.1 billion in the last 12 months. This financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments. While Microsoft may not seem like a value investment, in my opinion, its pricing is reasonable given its continued revenue and earnings growth, and it's likely to continue for the foreseeable future. I estimate EPS growth of 13% on a regular basis over the next 12 months. Based on this projection, I have a price target of $482.40 and estimate that the stock will trade at a non-GAAP P/E ratio of around 36. Looking ahead, I expect Microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15% over the next 5 to 10 years. While this prospect necessitates buying the stock at a fair valuation, I believe the current price provides an opportunity. The company's forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is only 6.5% above its five-year average, while its forward diluted earnings per share growth rate is nearly the same at 5.8%. MSFT faces long-term potential headwinds One potential challenge to Microsoft's long-term growth in AI is that its adoption can be cyclical. Currently, the demand for AI systems is high, which has prompted Microsoft and other big tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion. However, when the current trend peaks (likely due to macroeconomic constraints), growth may slow. According to the TipRanks risk analysis tool, Microsoft is exposed to 32% risk from legal and regulatory factors, which is higher than the industry average and could impact its AI operations due to increased scrutiny of data privacy and AI governance. Given this outlook, I expect some volatility in Microsoft's long-term growth trajectory, although it may not be as good as NVIDIA NVDA -0.06% ▼ and so on semiconductor companies so obvious. As market sentiment fluctuates, cyclical price and valuation declines coincide with temporarily lower growth rates and may provide more attractive buying opportunities. There is also a risk that Microsoft and other Big Tech players could over-invest in AI infrastructure. With 21% of its risk related to Tech & Innovation, Microsoft’s heavy investment in AI-driven initiatives, including data center infrastructure, could result in lower-than-expected returns if industry growth does not meet expectations. This may impact free cash flow margins in the medium term, contributing to further volatility.",0.5607,NEGATIVE,0.8794

For reference, my next potential entries will depend on developments in the bigger-picture macro sentiment toward artificial intelligence & microchip industries, but for now, are as follows: entry #1 is around $445, entry #2 is around $410, and entry #3 around $375. Was thinking I would add 1 or 2 shares at entry 1, and then larger numbers of shares if price action takes us down to the other 2 circled areas.

NVDA go up.csv,"Throughout October, there was a plethora of positive news and reports, which indicated that Nvidia Corporation stock still has plenty of upside. Currently, Nvidia has all the chances to once again exceed expectations and improve guidance when its Q3 earnings report comes out in November. NVDA stock remains a BUY for me, and its upside could be even greater than previously expected. Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is on a path to exceed its earnings expectations next month when its Q3 report comes out. While an earnings beat is not fully guaranteed, the latest earnings results of the company’s peers, suppliers, clients, and businesses that have a connection to the generative AI industry point to Nvidia having a stellar performance in Q3. The demand for its AI GPUs remains high, the company has been receiving upward revisions recently, and its stock is trading around its all-time high levels with a potential to appreciate even further in the upcoming months. While challenges are gradually mounting, it’s still safe to assume that all the growth opportunities currently exceed the existing risks.

Nvidia announces 50 billion stock buyback.csv,"Nvidia said Wednesday that its board of directors has approved a $50 billion stock buyback. The computer chip giant announced the share repurchase as part of its fiscal second-quarter earnings, in which it reported earnings and guidance that surpassed Wall Street expectations. Nvidia returned $15.4 billion to shareholders in share repurposes and cash dividends as part of the company’s first half of its fiscal 2025. The company said it had $7.5 billion remaining under its share repurchase plan, as of the end of its fiscal second quarter. Last year, Nvidia announced a $25 billion share buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results. Companies often experience a boom to their stock price after revealing stock buyback plans. In May, for instance, Apple announced a $110 billion stock buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results that showed overall sales fell 4% year over year and iPhone sales dropped 10% year over year. However, the iPhone maker’s shares rose 7% in after-hours trading, likely because Apple’s share buyback was the biggest in corporate history. With Nvidia’s shares dropping 4% in extended trading despite reporting solid financial results and announcing a stock buyback, some experts believe the company has been doing so well that it is getting harder to impress investors. Second-quarter sales rose 122% year over year to $30.04 billion, while net income jumped 168% year over year to $16.6 billion, Nvidia said.",0.6368,NEGATIVE,0.9997

NVIDIA's earnings today are going to be important to the market, I think a lot of people will decide to buy in and believe the macro cycle for AI will continue if they beat earnings.

Nvidia More Room to Run Just Getting Started.csv,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they’ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don’t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical. Yes, Nvidia’s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn’t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now. Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn’t possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia’s place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn’t happened and Nvidia’s only gotten stronger. That’s not to say over time Nvidia won’t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it’s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution. Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations. I don’t think AI is a bubble but I do think that Nvidia and the market as a whole can get ahead of themselves. Overall, this is likely just the initial first stage - not the end - of Nvidia’s growth story.",0.5568,POSITIVE,0.6477

"Nvidia reports earnings, Fed gathers in Jackson Hole What about this week.csv","In the final week of August, investors will be focused on two major events: Nvidia's earnings and the Federal Reserve's annual meeting in Jackson Hole. The Jackson Hole Economic Symposium will kick off on Thursday, with Fed Chair Jay Powell's address serving as the major event. Powell's comments on interest rates, the economy, and any indication that inflationary pressures are driving a reassessment of the Fed's present aims will be scrutinized. On the corporate front, Nvidia headlines the earnings story this week, with the chipmaker scheduled to publish data from a quarter that caused the chipmaker to increase its revenue forecast by 50%. Lowe's, BJ's Wholesale Club, and Peloton are also set to announce earnings this week. August is shaping up to be the worst month for stocks this year, with all three main averages closing last week lower after a hawkish read of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting sent equities lower and Treasury rates higher in the second half of the week. Economic data continues to come in stronger than expected, with the July retail sales report indicating a 0.7% increase in sales for the month, about double what economists forecast. The AtlantaFed's GDPNow projection now predicts third-quarter GDP growth of 5.8%, the strongest rate since the fourth quarter of 2021. Inflation has declined dramatically since Powell's Jackson Hole speech last year, when he predicted rates will climb until the ""job is done,"" lowering inflation. Powell has stated as recently as July that inflation is ""well above"" the Fed's long-run objective of 2%. On the corporate front, all eyes will be on Nvidia, which predicted that artificial intelligence demand will increase its current quarter sales projection from $7 billion to $11 billion. Nvidia stock is up about 200% year to date, but its gains have slowed along with the market since mid-July.

Looking further ahead, Oracle projects over $104 billion in revenue by fiscal 2029, along with a 20% year-over-year growth in earnings per share. Speaking at the Oracle CloudWorld event in Las Vegas, CEO Safra Catz expressed confidence in achieving these ambitious targets, pointing to new partnerships that allow Oracle’s database software to be offered through major cloud providers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.

Qualcomm Approached Intel About a Takeover in Recent Days.csv,"Qualcomm recently approached Intel with a takeover proposal, marking what could be one of the largest tech deals in recent memory, according to sources. Intel, once valued at over $290 billion, has seen its market cap fall to around $90 billion after a challenging year in which its shares dropped 60%. While a deal is far from guaranteed, Qualcomm’s interest comes as Intel struggles to recover under CEO Pat Gelsinger’s turnaround plan, which has yet to deliver significant results. Should Intel be receptive, the deal could face heavy antitrust scrutiny, though some argue it might bolster U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor industry. Qualcomm may consider offloading parts of Intel to complete the acquisition. Both companies have sought to capitalize on the AI boom, though they’ve lagged behind Nvidia. Intel, grappling with factory delays and cost-cutting measures, is receiving government subsidies as part of its efforts to build chip factories. A Qualcomm takeover could enhance its portfolio by adding Intel’s dominance in PCs and servers to its smartphone chip business. Despite this potential merger, Intel continues to face major hurdles, including the possible need to split its design and manufacturing operations amid growing calls for the company to separate its business divisions.

Serious question from someone who took a four-year trading break.csv,Hey everyone After a long long hiatus and licking my wounds I decided to try trading once again. Recently I've been changing up my approach and doing 5-7 DTE spy options. And it's been going pretty decent however recently I got a couple of August 30th calls for Nvidia I managed to get in at a good position for 133 calls. My thesis is that it's going to keep pumping up to the day of earnings. I don't have any intention of holding the position up until expiration. My question is regarding theta decay and volatility. I know that the closer I got to the expiration the less profit I'll see as a percentage of my position. And I also understand that during high levels of volatility it can go both ways. And I'm not really asking for specific advice just kind of guidance or knowledge as to how that may affect my position. I'm holding them over the weekend and I'm expecting Monday to start off a little red but to finish off green and so I'm not quite sure if I want to sell half my positions and wait till earnings or if I should wait to earnings in general. I strongly believe that Nvidia is going to beat their earnings I just don't know how drastically that's going to affect the price action.

Strategies to exploit uneducated investors.csv,"I feel that today's markets are saturated with retail investors that take too much risk with uneducated positions.

Super Micro Falls as Hindenburg Takes Aim With Short Report.csv,"Super Micro Computer Inc.'s shares took a hit on Tuesday following a short report from Hindenburg Research that questioned the company's financial practices and transparency. Hindenburg's report alleged significant accounting red flags, undisclosed related-party transactions, and potential violations of sanctions and export controls. Initially, the report caused Super Micro's stock to plummet by as much as 8.7%, but it later rebounded to close down 2.6%. The server manufacturer has been a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, with its high-performance servers in high demand for data centers. This surge in AI-related demand has driven significant growth for the company, doubling its revenue to $14.9 billion in the most recent fiscal year. Despite a steep decline from its March peak, Super Micro's stock remains up over 90% for the year, reflecting continued investor interest in the burgeoning AI sector. However, the Hindenburg report could intensify scrutiny on Super Micro's accounting practices and client relationships, particularly as the company has faced regulatory challenges in the past. In 2020, Super Micro resolved a U.S. SEC investigation by correcting its financial statements and paying a penalty for accounting issues from 2014 to 2017. As the AI market continues to expand, maintaining investor confidence will be crucial for Super Micro, especially amid concerns about the profitability of AI-optimized servers and the potential for increased regulatory oversight.

Technical Analysis Lesson - Reversal Day in Nvidia (NVDA).csv,"Every trader wants to know when the trend is changing from up to down or down to up. This happens when the leadership in the market changes from bulls to bears or bears to bulls. These trend changes are what every trader looks for. If they can accurately predict market turns, they can profit. That’s why they do what they do. Sometimes this change of leadership is slow and takes a long period of time to happen. These changes have price action that tends to show up on a chart as a ‘Rounded Top’ or ‘Rounded Bottom’ pattern. Sometimes the reversal is abrupt and takes place over a few time periods. This action tends to show up on a chart as a ‘V’ or ‘Inverted V’ reversal. But sometimes the trend changes just in one day... These dynamics can show up on a chart as a ‘Reversal Day’ pattern. One may have just happened in the stock of Nivida (NVDA). The Western world would call it an ‘Outside Reversal Day’. In candlestick terminology, it is called a ‘Bearish Engulfing Pattern’. It’s important to note that these candlestick patterns are at least 700 years old. They were developed by Japanese rice traders. It shows that the human nature which is illustrated in charts hasn’t changed. The name doesn’t matter. The action that it illustrates does. On Friday morning, it looked as though the uptrend in NVDA was going to continue for yet another day. It opened at a higher price than Thursday’s close. But then the tide turned… Over the day, the sellers came out of the woodwork. And not only did they hold off the assault. They overpowered the buyers and eventually pushed the price much lower. Importantly, Friday’s closing price was lower than Thursday’s opening price. This is frequently a characteristic of a trend that is reversing. Sometimes the change of leadership from bulls to bears happens over an extended time-period. But sometimes it occurs in just one day. That could be the case here.",0.5201,NEGATIVE,0.9938

As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

TSMC thoughts.csv,"TSMC went on a tear so far this year and they seem to be poised for higher growth since they are struggling to even meet demand for their chips right now. Along with main clients like NVIDIA and AMD and APPLE looked to work on AI. HPC revenue has growth i think 30% in their last 2 quarters. They are also mass producing 3nm chips which is starting to make up a nice chunk of their revenue. My main concern is obviously china but also that they are too tied to nvidia. Whenever i see them in the market, if NVIDIA is up 3%, they are up 6%, but if NVIDIA is down 3%, they are down 6-7%. Is it still a buy even though it has risen almost 50% this year? Is there a long term risk with china and competition with Intel and Samsung?",0.5787,NEGATIVE,0.9913
Understand this about INTC.csv,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,NEGATIVE,0.9999

I'm not saying dump 100% like wallstreetbets gambling, but I'm talking about investing in stuff you believe in, despite the temporary bad financials or pr or being undervalued?

I knew a lot about companies like Intel, AMD, Nvidia etc. In college I knew Nvdia was gonna blow up because of CUDA and what not, AMD would blow intel out of the way, QCOM I was a fan of because I did some research on their chips. These are very entry level knowledge, but if it's enough for me to believe in working for these companies, isn't it enough to invest let's say 10%, 20%?

Why am I bullish on SFY instead of SPY.csv,"A comparison analysis between the holdings of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY), I have compiled information from the most recent available data. Below is a table showing the top 10 holdings for each ETF along with their percentage weight in the respective ETFs. This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings: Data Sources: SPY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Schwab, Yahoo Finance. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST) SFY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Zacks.com, Yahoo Finance. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST) Key Observations: Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting. It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation. I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors: Expense Ratio: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. Stock Selection Methodology: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. Performance Trends: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. Portfolio Diversification: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. Market Positioning: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. Innovative Approach of SoFi: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy. It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.

"Why Are Analysts Increasing NVIDIA’s Price Target Is It Out of Fear That Something Bad Will Happen, .csv","NVIDIA, often considered the heart of AI stocks, has recently been in the spotlight as analysts uniformly raise their stock targets.

I believe that other companies will eventually have to invest in their products and services, maybe not now, but certainly in the future and this isn’t including their military side. I’m iffy on holding NVIDIA because of how much hype it’s gotten this year but it’s hard to gage how much demand is needed , i have no problem holding for the next year but after that I might sell. I’ve added 6 more shares of CRWD because I genuinely think that bigger companies in this day and age cannot operate without Cybersecurity. The last company i worked at (Cigna) uses Crowd-strikes malware scan and in the midst of CRWDs downturn with delta etc i had a good feeling that it would recover. AMZ remains my biggest holding and i think it’s still so undervalued. I’d like to hear your guys perspectives on the balance of my portfolio.

Quarterly Highlights: • Earnings per share: 69 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected • Revenue: $5.83 billion vs. $5.72 billion expected • Expected Q3 Sales: $6.7 billion vs. $6.61 billion expected Financial Performance: • Net Income: $265 million (16 cents per share) vs. $27 million (2 cents per share) YoY • Data Center Revenue: Grew 115% YoY to $2.8 billion, driven by AI chip sales (Instinct GPUs) • Client Segment (PCs): Rose 49% YoY to $1.5 billion, indicating a recovering PC market • Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% YoY, below the expected $676 million • Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% YoY, slightly above the expected $856 million AMD’s AI chip sales, reported under the Data Center segment, saw significant growth, highlighting the company’s efforts to compete with Nvidia. AMD’s MI300X AI chip aims to capture market share from Nvidia, which has seen its stock double this year due to high demand for AI GPUs. Despite a challenging year with shares down 6% in 2024, AMD remains the second-largest vendor of data center GPUs, trailing Nvidia. Investors are focused on AMD’s ability to grow its AI business, with the company anticipating $4 billion in AI chip sales this year, accounting for 15% of its total expected sales. AMD’s core business in CPUs for laptops and servers and its growing AI chip segment position the company as a significant player in the evolving technology landscape.

AMD to acquire server builder ZT Systems for 49 billion in cash and stock.csv,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced on Monday its plans to acquire server manufacturer ZT Systems for $4.9 billion, as part of its strategy to bolster its portfolio of artificial intelligence (AI) chips and hardware, and to compete more effectively against Nvidia. The acquisition will be financed with 75% cash and the remaining in stock, leveraging AMD’s $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments reported in the second quarter. The rising demands of AI computing have necessitated the use of thousands of interconnected chips to achieve the required processing power, making the design and construction of server systems increasingly critical. This acquisition will enable AMD to enhance its capabilities in this area. According to AMD CEO Lisa Su, the addition of ZT Systems’ engineers will accelerate the company’s ability to test and deploy its latest AI GPUs on a scale required by major cloud computing companies like Microsoft. Although AMD plans to incorporate ZT Systems into its operations, it has no intention of competing directly in the server manufacturing market. Instead, the company plans to divest its server manufacturing business after the acquisition is finalized, with no discussions yet held with potential buyers. ZT Systems CEO Frank Zhang will join AMD, reporting to Forrest Norrod, AMD’s data center chief. The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2025, will see AMD retaining about 1,000 of ZT Systems' roughly 2,500 employees. AMD anticipates that the acquisition will positively impact its adjusted financial performance by the end of 2025.

AMZN Earnings Preview- What to watch for tonight.csv,"Earnings from Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. will be crucial in guiding the Nasdaq 100 after a volatile period marked by extreme fluctuations. As the last megacaps to release results before Nvidia Corp. in August, these reports will set the tone for tech investors, particularly focusing on how artificial intelligence is driving growth in Amazon’s cloud-computing unit and boosting demand for Apple's next iPhone. The results will also provide valuable insights into the health of consumer spending, with Amazon shares already up about 25% this year. Amazon.com Inc. is set to release its Q2 earnings report after the market closes, with a conference call scheduled for 5:30 p.m. ET. Analysts project the company will report revenue of $148.8 billion, marking an 11% increase year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up from 65 cents in the same period last year. Amazon has guided for Q2 operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, signaling strong performance despite broader economic challenges. Key metrics expected by analysts include AWS revenue at nearly $26 billion, representing more than 17% year-over-year growth, and advertising revenue projected to reach $13 billion, a 21.7% increase from last year. The Stores segment, bolstered by events like Prime Day, is anticipated to show significant activity, while improvements in operating margins, especially in the North America segment, will be closely watched. Analysts also expect updates on AI initiatives and the overall capital expenditures for the year. Comments from analysts emphasize the importance of AI and cloud services for Amazon's future growth. Citi analysts, led by Ronald Josey, anticipate AWS revenue growth accelerated in Q2 due to generative AI tailwinds, while also predicting a beat in operating income thanks to improved retail efficiencies and strong advertising demand. Truist analyst Youssef Squali highlights Amazon's ability to gain share in global e-commerce and sees multiple growth vectors powering the company's continued expansion. Retail performance and consumer spending trends will be significant indicators, especially given mixed reports this earnings season. Analysts like Matt Stucky of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management note the importance of Amazon's retail margin expansion and its impact on profitability. Additionally, the potential for a surprise dividend announcement is a point of interest, as Amazon remains the last major tech company without a dividend program. Amazon's Q2 results will follow earnings reports from key competitors like Microsoft and Google, both of which had mixed receptions based on their cloud and AI performances. Wall Street's current focus is on tangible returns from AI investments, making Amazon's updates on its AI initiatives and AWS growth crucial for investor sentiment. The company's dominant position in the cloud market and ongoing efforts to enhance its e-commerce offerings will be under the microscope. Amazon saw its stock rise following a strong Q1 earnings report, showcasing impressive upside in both EPS and revenue. The standout metric was a significant 221% year-over-year increase in operating income to $15.31 billion, far surpassing the prior guidance of $8-12 billion. The company’s guidance for Q2 operating income of $10-14 billion also exceeded expectations. The Stores segment performed well, driven by successful shopping events like Amazon's Spring Deal Days in Europe and the first Big Spring Sale in Canada and the US. Faster delivery times, enhanced by regionalization efforts and cost-saving measures such as consolidating units into fewer boxes, boosted customer purchase frequency and overall spend. Additionally, Amazon is preparing for its 10th Prime Day event in July, which is expected to further drive sales. Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the highlight of the quarter, with a 17% growth in constant currency, an improvement from previous quarters. AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue business, with significant growth in both generative and non-generative AI workloads. The Advertising Services segment also showed robust growth, with a 24% increase in revenue to $11.82 billion, driven primarily by sponsored ads and early gains in Prime Video ads. Despite guiding Q2 revenue below consensus due to foreign exchange impacts, the strong performance in AWS and advertising has left investors optimistic.",0.5699,POSITIVE,0.9923

Some of it just recovered from 2022 to it's pre-2022 state, but Nvidia has 205% growth this year, which is crazy Index funds - the legendary S&P 500. Everyone says it's the most stable etc - but I've found other indexes with even better growth. SP500 usually have the 7-10% yearly return and last 5 years went up 56%, but for example the INDEX Vanguard Growth ETF went up 87% for the last 5 years - and it was also a steady growth, not a lucky spike during one period. What do you think, is it really smart to go with SP500 or are there other ones that are much better, even tho SP500 is so hyped by everyone? and if you agree - what other indexes with better return would you recommend? Leverage - I'm not familiar with how much can you leverage in stocks, but for people that invest in the top 10, which most likely will go up in the future, wouldn't be smarter to invest it with i.e 5x leverage, since the companies like Microsoft are stable, and eventually will grow? Stock Math - let's say I invest $10.000 in a stock and it declines -50%. I know have $5.000. If it goes up by 50%, do I get $7.500 or do I get my $10.000 back? Logically the first answer, but something doesn't give me a peace of mind here, so I prefer to ask Eli Lilly - what do you think about this stock? Growed massive amount lately, and pharmaceutical industry will definitely be there in 5 or 10 years.",0.5565,NEGATIVE,0.9857

Fundamentals behind a USA market drop this week & some positives.csv,"The problem areas in the USA: -------------------------- *- The Schiller PE is at a very high level. Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble. So stocks are highly expensive. *- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022! We are more of a service economy than a goods economy, *- World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle. That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local sales declines are offset. Additionally the trade war hampers both sides. *- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels. *- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers. You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term. People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank. However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials. AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth. AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales. So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia. This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW. I don't own any MKSI. This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording. So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN.

"Impacting NVDA is underlying logic,what does OpenAI is change in strategy mean.csv","Big model pre-training bottleneck: Silicon Valley AI labs are generally struggling with new model training, with OpenAI's Orion and Google's Gemini 2.0 failing to significantly outperform their predecessors, defying the “law of scaling”. This law used to mean that model performance would continue to increase with data and computation, but the scaling effect has now plateaued. Computing in the reasoning phase: To overcome pre-training bottlenecks, OpenAI and other labs are exploring “compute on test” techniques that enable human-like multi-step reasoning by allowing models to generate and evaluate multiple possibilities in real-time during the reasoning phase. This approach can be used more effectively for complex tasks such as mathematics and coding to optimize reasoning performance. Hardware Demand Shift: Market demand is likely to shift from large-scale pre-training clusters to inference clouds as new technologies reduce parameter requirements. This will weaken NVIDIA's monopoly in the training chip market, and the inference chip market may see more competition, especially as companies such as Groq may fill the new demand. Capital Trends: Venture capital organizations are highly concerned about this change, and are gradually investing more resources in distributed inference clouds to cater to the distributed server needs of inference computing.",0.5346,POSITIVE,0.6048

Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,NEGATIVE,0.9443

Hi! I’m Dan Howley, the tech editor at Yahoo Finance, and Nvidia has seemingly been at the forefront of virtually everything I’ve covered since ChatGPT hit the scene in 2022. I’ve been covering the tech space for 13 years and tracking Nvidia for even longer. I built my first desktop PC with an Nvidia graphics card in high school and have continued using its products ever since. Now I, like everyone else, am focused on Nvidia’s AI efforts, from reporting on how they’re dealing with the threat of increased competition to attending the company’s GTC conference to chatting with CEO Jensen Huang alongside my colleague Julie Hyman. With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia’s chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like AMD are gaining steam, and Nvidia’s own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant. How that plays out over the next few years is anyone’s guess. In today’s fiscal 2025 third quarter earnings report, Nvidia beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines on the strength of sales of its high-powered AI chips. 💵 Revenue: $35.08B vs $33.2B expected 💲 Adjusted EPS: $0.81 vs $0.74 expected 💾 Data center revenue: $30.8B vs $29B expected Nvidia also said it anticipates revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, for the fiscal fourth quarter. That's just ahead of Wall Street expectations of $37 billion. I’ll be back tomorrow, Nov. 21, at 10 a.m. ET to answer your questions about Nvidia’s latest earnings, the market reaction, and where the stock goes from here. That does it for me for today.

It's not the question IF, the question is WHEN. Immediate resistance is at 438/439. UPST - Upstart had great earnings and the stock went up by 24% in a day after earnings. The next immediate resistance is sitting between 86-95 META - Meta is going in a range at this point. The support is sitting at 558-569 and price coming to that area will be nicely bought.

Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&P 500 gains.csv,"= just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing = The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023 https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9 The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions. It’s an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve’s inflation battle, noted FactSet’s Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post. The 10 top performing days for the S&P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%. The S&P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday’s close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%. Through Dec. 22, the S&P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%. Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said. That didn’t mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote. Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found. Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July. The strategy “indicates the Fed’s measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,” Jakobsen said. The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks’ bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group’s announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering. SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a “mini” banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown. Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks — Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78% , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, 0.16%, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%, Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%, Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%, and Meta Platforms Inc. META, 0.56%. See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024? Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind. The S&P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted. In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high: The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&P 500’s weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted. Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&P 500’s overall return, he wrote, with the company’s success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.",0.5482,NEGATIVE,0.9995
Mega-caps vs small caps.csv,"The current state of the stock market exhibits a stark contrast between the performance of mega-cap and small-cap stocks, as investors grapple with mixed signals from major corporations and broader market indices.  Recent developments have highlighted this divide, with Microsoft's upcoming earnings report set to further shape the narrative. Mega-Cap Weakness and Market Impact Microsoft, a key player in the technology sector, is set to report its earnings after the market close, and its performance could significantly influence investor sentiment.  The recent underperformance of large-cap stocks like Merck and Procter & Gamble, both of which have disappointed with earnings guidance, has contributed to the Nasdaq Composite's (-0.9%) and S&P 500's (-0.4%) downward pressure.  This weakness is reflected in the Vanguard Mega-Cap Growth ETF (MGK), which is down 1.1%. Small-Cap Resilience In contrast, small-cap stocks have shown relative strength, with the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 Value Index posting gains.  The equal-weighted S&P 500 is also holding its own, indicating that smaller companies are providing a stabilizing force in the market.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, buoyed by the financials and energy sectors, adds to this resilience. Sectors in Focus The IT sector, weighed down by NVIDIA's (-5.0%) decline ahead of AMD's earnings release, is leading the pack of losers.  Consumer staples, also negatively impacted, are lagging behind. On the other hand, financials, and energy sectors are posting gains, offering a glimmer of hope for investors seeking opportunities. Treasuries and Market Sentiment The Treasury market remains relatively calm, with the 2-yr note yield down to 4.38% and the 10-yr note yield at 4.17%.  Economic indicators, such as the better-than-expected consumer confidence index and the Bank of Japan's policy decision, have not sparked significant market movements, suggesting that investors are cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's FOMC decision on Wednesday. As we await Microsoft's earnings report, the stock market's divide between mega-cap and small-cap stocks is a cause for concern, especially for those relying on large-cap performance.  However, the resilience of small-cap companies and select sectors is providing a silver lining. Investors should stay vigilant, monitor market reactions to key earnings releases, and consider a diversified portfolio that takes into account the current market dynamics.  The Federal Reserve's decision will likely play a crucial role in determining the market's next course of action.",0.5419,NEGATIVE,0.9136

MSFT faces long-term potential disadvantages.csv,"I think one of the main reasons Microsoft is a great long-term investment is its long history of generating a lot of free cash flow. At the time of writing, the company's free cash flow margin is over 30%, with free cash flow rising from $15.9 billion in 2009 to $74.1 billion in the last 12 months. This financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments. While Microsoft may not seem like a value investment, in my opinion, its pricing is reasonable given its continued revenue and earnings growth, and it's likely to continue for the foreseeable future. I estimate EPS growth of 13% on a regular basis over the next 12 months. Based on this projection, I have a price target of $482.40 and estimate that the stock will trade at a non-GAAP P/E ratio of around 36. Looking ahead, I expect Microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15% over the next 5 to 10 years. While this prospect necessitates buying the stock at a fair valuation, I believe the current price provides an opportunity. The company's forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is only 6.5% above its five-year average, while its forward diluted earnings per share growth rate is nearly the same at 5.8%. MSFT faces long-term potential headwinds One potential challenge to Microsoft's long-term growth in AI is that its adoption can be cyclical. Currently, the demand for AI systems is high, which has prompted Microsoft and other big tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion. However, when the current trend peaks (likely due to macroeconomic constraints), growth may slow. According to the TipRanks risk analysis tool, Microsoft is exposed to 32% risk from legal and regulatory factors, which is higher than the industry average and could impact its AI operations due to increased scrutiny of data privacy and AI governance. Given this outlook, I expect some volatility in Microsoft's long-term growth trajectory, although it may not be as good as NVIDIA NVDA -0.06% ▼ and so on semiconductor companies so obvious. As market sentiment fluctuates, cyclical price and valuation declines coincide with temporarily lower growth rates and may provide more attractive buying opportunities. There is also a risk that Microsoft and other Big Tech players could over-invest in AI infrastructure. With 21% of its risk related to Tech & Innovation, Microsoft’s heavy investment in AI-driven initiatives, including data center infrastructure, could result in lower-than-expected returns if industry growth does not meet expectations. This may impact free cash flow margins in the medium term, contributing to further volatility.",0.5607,NEGATIVE,0.8794

The demand for its AI GPUs remains high, the company has been receiving upward revisions recently, and its stock is trading around its all-time high levels with a potential to appreciate even further in the upcoming months.

Nvidia announces 50 billion stock buyback.csv,"Nvidia said Wednesday that its board of directors has approved a $50 billion stock buyback. The computer chip giant announced the share repurchase as part of its fiscal second-quarter earnings, in which it reported earnings and guidance that surpassed Wall Street expectations. Nvidia returned $15.4 billion to shareholders in share repurposes and cash dividends as part of the company’s first half of its fiscal 2025. The company said it had $7.5 billion remaining under its share repurchase plan, as of the end of its fiscal second quarter. Last year, Nvidia announced a $25 billion share buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results. Companies often experience a boom to their stock price after revealing stock buyback plans. In May, for instance, Apple announced a $110 billion stock buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results that showed overall sales fell 4% year over year and iPhone sales dropped 10% year over year. However, the iPhone maker’s shares rose 7% in after-hours trading, likely because Apple’s share buyback was the biggest in corporate history. With Nvidia’s shares dropping 4% in extended trading despite reporting solid financial results and announcing a stock buyback, some experts believe the company has been doing so well that it is getting harder to impress investors.

Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they’ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don’t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical. Yes, Nvidia’s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn’t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now. Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn’t possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia’s place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn’t happened and Nvidia’s only gotten stronger. That’s not to say over time Nvidia won’t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it’s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution. Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations. I don’t think AI is a bubble but I do think that Nvidia and the market as a whole can get ahead of themselves. Overall, this is likely just the initial first stage - not the end - of Nvidia’s growth story.",0.5568,POSITIVE,0.6477

"Nvidia reports earnings, Fed gathers in Jackson Hole What about this week.csv","In the final week of August, investors will be focused on two major events: Nvidia's earnings and the Federal Reserve's annual meeting in Jackson Hole. The Jackson Hole Economic Symposium will kick off on Thursday, with Fed Chair Jay Powell's address serving as the major event. Powell's comments on interest rates, the economy, and any indication that inflationary pressures are driving a reassessment of the Fed's present aims will be scrutinized. On the corporate front, Nvidia headlines the earnings story this week, with the chipmaker scheduled to publish data from a quarter that caused the chipmaker to increase its revenue forecast by 50%. Lowe's, BJ's Wholesale Club, and Peloton are also set to announce earnings this week. August is shaping up to be the worst month for stocks this year, with all three main averages closing last week lower after a hawkish read of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting sent equities lower and Treasury rates higher in the second half of the week. Economic data continues to come in stronger than expected, with the July retail sales report indicating a 0.7% increase in sales for the month, about double what economists forecast. The AtlantaFed's GDPNow projection now predicts third-quarter GDP growth of 5.8%, the strongest rate since the fourth quarter of 2021. Inflation has declined dramatically since Powell's Jackson Hole speech last year, when he predicted rates will climb until the ""job is done,"" lowering inflation. Powell has stated as recently as July that inflation is ""well above"" the Fed's long-run objective of 2%. On the corporate front, all eyes will be on Nvidia, which predicted that artificial intelligence demand will increase its current quarter sales projection from $7 billion to $11 billion. Nvidia stock is up about 200% year to date, but its gains have slowed along with the market since mid-July. Nvidia's earnings release in late May signaled a shift in overall market mood for the year, with Wall Street strategists becoming more overtly bullish on stock market performance in 2023.",0.5659,NEGATIVE,0.9998

"Oracle bumps up fiscal 2026 revenue forecast, lifting stock 6%.csv","Oracle lifted its fiscal 2026 revenue forecast on Thursday, pushing its stock up nearly 6% in after-hours trading.

Looking further ahead, Oracle projects over $104 billion in revenue by fiscal 2029, along with a 20% year-over-year growth in earnings per share. Speaking at the Oracle CloudWorld event in Las Vegas, CEO Safra Catz expressed confidence in achieving these ambitious targets, pointing to new partnerships that allow Oracle’s database software to be offered through major cloud providers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Oracle’s strong performance continued this week as its stock gained roughly 15% over the past three trading days, setting a new record and marking a 55% increase for the year—second only to Nvidia among large-cap tech companies. Oracle’s cloud infrastructure revenue jumped 45% last quarter, outpacing its competitors and benefiting from businesses transitioning their workloads to the cloud. The company is also positioning itself to capitalize on the growing demand for artificial intelligence, announcing its cloud unit has secured orders for over 131,000 next-generation Nvidia GPUs.

Qualcomm Approached Intel About a Takeover in Recent Days.csv,"Qualcomm recently approached Intel with a takeover proposal, marking what could be one of the largest tech deals in recent memory, according to sources. Intel, once valued at over $290 billion, has seen its market cap fall to around $90 billion after a challenging year in which its shares dropped 60%. While a deal is far from guaranteed, Qualcomm’s interest comes as Intel struggles to recover under CEO Pat Gelsinger’s turnaround plan, which has yet to deliver significant results. Should Intel be receptive, the deal could face heavy antitrust scrutiny, though some argue it might bolster U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor industry. Qualcomm may consider offloading parts of Intel to complete the acquisition. Both companies have sought to capitalize on the AI boom, though they’ve lagged behind Nvidia. Intel, grappling with factory delays and cost-cutting measures, is receiving government subsidies as part of its efforts to build chip factories. A Qualcomm takeover could enhance its portfolio by adding Intel’s dominance in PCs and servers to its smartphone chip business. Despite this potential merger, Intel continues to face major hurdles, including the possible need to split its design and manufacturing operations amid growing calls for the company to separate its business divisions.

Serious question from someone who took a four-year trading break.csv,Hey everyone After a long long hiatus and licking my wounds I decided to try trading once again. Recently I've been changing up my approach and doing 5-7 DTE spy options. And it's been going pretty decent however recently I got a couple of August 30th calls for Nvidia I managed to get in at a good position for 133 calls. My thesis is that it's going to keep pumping up to the day of earnings. I don't have any intention of holding the position up until expiration. My question is regarding theta decay and volatility. I know that the closer I got to the expiration the less profit I'll see as a percentage of my position. And I also understand that during high levels of volatility it can go both ways. And I'm not really asking for specific advice just kind of guidance or knowledge as to how that may affect my position. I'm holding them over the weekend and I'm expecting Monday to start off a little red but to finish off green and so I'm not quite sure if I want to sell half my positions and wait till earnings or if I should wait to earnings in general. I strongly believe that Nvidia is going to beat their earnings I just don't know how drastically that's going to affect the price action. Any and all input is definitely appreciated Thanks in advance,0.5421,NEGATIVE,0.9936

Super Micro Falls as Hindenburg Takes Aim With Short Report.csv,"Super Micro Computer Inc.'s shares took a hit on Tuesday following a short report from Hindenburg Research that questioned the company's financial practices and transparency. Hindenburg's report alleged significant accounting red flags, undisclosed related-party transactions, and potential violations of sanctions and export controls. Initially, the report caused Super Micro's stock to plummet by as much as 8.7%, but it later rebounded to close down 2.6%. The server manufacturer has been a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, with its high-performance servers in high demand for data centers. This surge in AI-related demand has driven significant growth for the company, doubling its revenue to $14.9 billion in the most recent fiscal year. Despite a steep decline from its March peak, Super Micro's stock remains up over 90% for the year, reflecting continued investor interest in the burgeoning AI sector. However, the Hindenburg report could intensify scrutiny on Super Micro's accounting practices and client relationships, particularly as the company has faced regulatory challenges in the past. In 2020, Super Micro resolved a U.S. SEC investigation by correcting its financial statements and paying a penalty for accounting issues from 2014 to 2017.

Technical Analysis Lesson - Reversal Day in Nvidia (NVDA).csv,"Every trader wants to know when the trend is changing from up to down or down to up. This happens when the leadership in the market changes from bulls to bears or bears to bulls. These trend changes are what every trader looks for. If they can accurately predict market turns, they can profit. That’s why they do what they do. Sometimes this change of leadership is slow and takes a long period of time to happen. These changes have price action that tends to show up on a chart as a ‘Rounded Top’ or ‘Rounded Bottom’ pattern. Sometimes the reversal is abrupt and takes place over a few time periods. This action tends to show up on a chart as a ‘V’ or ‘Inverted V’ reversal. But sometimes the trend changes just in one day... These dynamics can show up on a chart as a ‘Reversal Day’ pattern. One may have just happened in the stock of Nivida (NVDA). The Western world would call it an ‘Outside Reversal Day’. In candlestick terminology, it is called a ‘Bearish Engulfing Pattern’. It’s important to note that these candlestick patterns are at least 700 years old. They were developed by Japanese rice traders. It shows that the human nature which is illustrated in charts hasn’t changed. The name doesn’t matter. The action that it illustrates does. On Friday morning, it looked as though the uptrend in NVDA was going to continue for yet another day. It opened at a higher price than Thursday’s close. But then the tide turned… Over the day, the sellers came out of the woodwork. And not only did they hold off the assault. They overpowered the buyers and eventually pushed the price much lower. Importantly, Friday’s closing price was lower than Thursday’s opening price. This is frequently a characteristic of a trend that is reversing. Sometimes the change of leadership from bulls to bears happens over an extended time-period. But sometimes it occurs in just one day. That could be the case here.",0.5201,NEGATIVE,0.9938

Yes the stock is expensive right now, but given the growth opportunity I would argue there is still plenty of room for expansion. Yes, China is a threat, but something tells me that China would not dare suffer the economic sanctions western nations would impose if they made a move in Taiwan.

TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand.csv,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

Understand this about INTC.csv,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,NEGATIVE,0.9999

I'm not saying dump 100% like wallstreetbets gambling, but I'm talking about investing in stuff you believe in, despite the temporary bad financials or pr or being undervalued?

Why am I bullish on SFY instead of SPY.csv,"A comparison analysis between the holdings of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY), I have compiled information from the most recent available data. Below is a table showing the top 10 holdings for each ETF along with their percentage weight in the respective ETFs. This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings: Data Sources: SPY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Schwab, Yahoo Finance. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST) SFY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Zacks.com, Yahoo Finance. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST) Key Observations: Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting. It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation. I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors: Expense Ratio: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. Stock Selection Methodology: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. Performance Trends: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. Portfolio Diversification: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. Market Positioning: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. Innovative Approach of SoFi: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy. It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.

"Why Are Analysts Increasing NVIDIA’s Price Target Is It Out of Fear That Something Bad Will Happen, .csv","NVIDIA, often considered the heart of AI stocks, has recently been in the spotlight as analysts uniformly raise their stock targets. To me, this trend seems somewhat peculiar, even considering the current earnings season. The buoyant optimism surrounding the stock’s potential rise is sparking doubt in my mind. Should the stock underperform, it will be a litmus test of these analysts’ sincerity, raising questions about whether they may be manipulating public sentiment. In the broader context of the semiconductor sector, the recent quarterly earnings have been largely underwhelming. Yet, all semiconductor stocks appear to be buoyed by NVIDIA’s momentum. A stumble in NVIDIA’s stock could trigger a broader tech market downfall, while success could reignite a bullish trend for tech stocks. My intuition, however, leans towards a potential disappointment. NVIDIA might surpass current estimates but simultaneously lower their future guidance due to sluggish growth. Should this occur, a significant drop in stock price could follow. Disclaimer: These thoughts are purely my own observations and should not be taken as financial advice.",0.542,NEGATIVE,0.9983

Worse case scenario the perfect Bear cocktail.csv,"After reading all the comments from my last post and doing some more thinking. I decided to entertain the idea of what would be the perfect Bear cocktail that could trigger a Stock Market destabilization. I'm not taking into account any type of positive news. I'm simply going the negative route, in a slow and systematic manner, without any huge trigger events. What am I missing and at what dates that's important and could also add to this? If you notice in the prior post list, three out of six times... rising interest rates were part of the cause that brought the market down at least 20%. Oil price shocks two out of 6. Then there´s speculative investments at the dotcom bubble. Covid, overvaluation, trade tensions... Stagflation. So these have to be in the mix one way or another: Cocktail Potential Ingredients: Rising interest rates. Oil price shocks. Speculative tech investments. Overvaluation. Trade tensions. Stagflation. New round of Covid-19. Housing or Commercial Real Estate Bubble. So this is the speculative worse case scenario we could have without going as far as having a WWIII: February 13, 2024: CPI report comes in hot. S&P500 comes down 1.5%, some buy the tiny dip. February 15, 2024: Jobless claims rise. Doesn't alter the market but adds to the cocktail mix. February 16, 2024: A higher-than-expected PPI indicates increasing costs at the producer level, which can signal rising inflationary pressures. Producers might pass these higher costs onto consumers, leading to an increase in consumer prices and overall inflation. The Fed to consider tightening monetary policy more aggressively than previously anticipated to combat inflation. This could include raising interest rates or adjusting the pace of tapering asset purchases. Financial markets don't react negatively to a higher-than-expected PPI, as it they priced it in from the CPI report. February 21, 2024: Nvidia posts earnings, they actually do fine but investors realize that´s gonna be the ceiling for now so the stock falls 15%. Other tech stocks get stained by the fear, bringing the S&P500 2.5% lower. AI investment sentiments leans towards potentially speculative for now. March 12, 2024: February´s CPI report comes in hot again, causing Algorithmic trades to sell and bring down the S&P500 another 2%. March 19-20, 2024: FOMC Meeting gives subtext of potentially not bringing interest rates down yet. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterates emphasis on the central bank's commitment to combating inflation, even if it requires keeping interest rates high for an extended period. This brings down the market sentiment down and numbers another 1%.

The rise of remote work led to a decreased demand for office spaces, the pandemic trained people to make purchases online, commercial real estate bubble starts to show symptoms of cracking up.

Market loses .5% April 17, 2024: Tom Lee's bullish perspective has been challenged by the prior events and during an interview he mentions that this was the turmoil he had been expecting but sees the S&P500 going back to 5,200 points by the end of the year. Currently at 4,600... 7.5% below all time highs. May 1, 2024: FOMC Meeting leaves a bad taste in mouth. Jerome shifts narrative towards not lowering interests rates yet. Market falls another 2.5% on the bad sentiment. May 15, 2024: Situations in the Middle East, such as tensions in Gaza or Iran, could impact global oil supplies by affecting regional stability and energy infrastructure. Saudi Arabia, a key OPEC member, might alter its oil production strategy in response to shifts in global politics, economic pressures, or changes in energy demand. Actions perceived as irrational could stem from strategic decisions to protect national interests, influence oil prices, or respond to international events. S&P500 falls 0.5%. July 8, 2024: A new wave of Covid-19 actually breaks through the collective deceit of it being over because death rates rise significantly and word spreads out again from hospital staff that's it's getting real bad. Stock market reacts in a mixed manner. Amazon and tech companies go up a little, small caps enter another bad rout. S&P500 falls 1%. July 20, 2024: Numbers start to confirm a Stagflation situation actually taking place. A significant slowdown in economic growth, rising unemployment rates, declining consumer spending, and a contraction in manufacturing. Inflation pressures, coupled with tightening monetary policies aimed at controlling price levels, contribute to decreased economic activity.

Although AMD plans to incorporate ZT Systems into its operations, it has no intention of competing directly in the server manufacturing market. Instead, the company plans to divest its server manufacturing business after the acquisition is finalized, with no discussions yet held with potential buyers. ZT Systems CEO Frank Zhang will join AMD, reporting to Forrest Norrod, AMD’s data center chief. The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2025, will see AMD retaining about 1,000 of ZT Systems' roughly 2,500 employees. AMD anticipates that the acquisition will positively impact its adjusted financial performance by the end of 2025.

AMZN Earnings Preview- What to watch for tonight.csv,"Earnings from Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. will be crucial in guiding the Nasdaq 100 after a volatile period marked by extreme fluctuations. As the last megacaps to release results before Nvidia Corp. in August, these reports will set the tone for tech investors, particularly focusing on how artificial intelligence is driving growth in Amazon’s cloud-computing unit and boosting demand for Apple's next iPhone. The results will also provide valuable insights into the health of consumer spending, with Amazon shares already up about 25% this year. Amazon.com Inc. is set to release its Q2 earnings report after the market closes, with a conference call scheduled for 5:30 p.m. ET. Analysts project the company will report revenue of $148.8 billion, marking an 11% increase year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up from 65 cents in the same period last year. Amazon has guided for Q2 operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, signaling strong performance despite broader economic challenges. Key metrics expected by analysts include AWS revenue at nearly $26 billion, representing more than 17% year-over-year growth, and advertising revenue projected to reach $13 billion, a 21.7% increase from last year. The Stores segment, bolstered by events like Prime Day, is anticipated to show significant activity, while improvements in operating margins, especially in the North America segment, will be closely watched. Analysts also expect updates on AI initiatives and the overall capital expenditures for the year. Comments from analysts emphasize the importance of AI and cloud services for Amazon's future growth. Citi analysts, led by Ronald Josey, anticipate AWS revenue growth accelerated in Q2 due to generative AI tailwinds, while also predicting a beat in operating income thanks to improved retail efficiencies and strong advertising demand. Truist analyst Youssef Squali highlights Amazon's ability to gain share in global e-commerce and sees multiple growth vectors powering the company's continued expansion. Retail performance and consumer spending trends will be significant indicators, especially given mixed reports this earnings season. Analysts like Matt Stucky of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management note the importance of Amazon's retail margin expansion and its impact on profitability. Additionally, the potential for a surprise dividend announcement is a point of interest, as Amazon remains the last major tech company without a dividend program. Amazon's Q2 results will follow earnings reports from key competitors like Microsoft and Google, both of which had mixed receptions based on their cloud and AI performances. Wall Street's current focus is on tangible returns from AI investments, making Amazon's updates on its AI initiatives and AWS growth crucial for investor sentiment. The company's dominant position in the cloud market and ongoing efforts to enhance its e-commerce offerings will be under the microscope. Amazon saw its stock rise following a strong Q1 earnings report, showcasing impressive upside in both EPS and revenue. The standout metric was a significant 221% year-over-year increase in operating income to $15.31 billion, far surpassing the prior guidance of $8-12 billion. The company’s guidance for Q2 operating income of $10-14 billion also exceeded expectations. The Stores segment performed well, driven by successful shopping events like Amazon's Spring Deal Days in Europe and the first Big Spring Sale in Canada and the US. Faster delivery times, enhanced by regionalization efforts and cost-saving measures such as consolidating units into fewer boxes, boosted customer purchase frequency and overall spend. Additionally, Amazon is preparing for its 10th Prime Day event in July, which is expected to further drive sales. Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the highlight of the quarter, with a 17% growth in constant currency, an improvement from previous quarters. AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue business, with significant growth in both generative and non-generative AI workloads. The Advertising Services segment also showed robust growth, with a 24% increase in revenue to $11.82 billion, driven primarily by sponsored ads and early gains in Prime Video ads. Despite guiding Q2 revenue below consensus due to foreign exchange impacts, the strong performance in AWS and advertising has left investors optimistic.",0.5699,POSITIVE,0.9923

ATH  Leverage  Index Funds and more.csv,"I got a few questions as a newbie Some of the companies I want to invest long-term are either at their ATH or close to ATH, like Microsoft or Nvidia. I'm wondering whether I should wait for it to drop, because most of the stock market is green this year, so I have a feeling it may drop since it grew so much, what do you think? Some of it just recovered from 2022 to it's pre-2022 state, but Nvidia has 205% growth this year, which is crazy Index funds - the legendary S&P 500. Everyone says it's the most stable etc - but I've found other indexes with even better growth. SP500 usually have the 7-10% yearly return and last 5 years went up 56%, but for example the INDEX Vanguard Growth ETF went up 87% for the last 5 years - and it was also a steady growth, not a lucky spike during one period. What do you think, is it really smart to go with SP500 or are there other ones that are much better, even tho SP500 is so hyped by everyone? and if you agree - what other indexes with better return would you recommend? Leverage - I'm not familiar with how much can you leverage in stocks, but for people that invest in the top 10, which most likely will go up in the future, wouldn't be smarter to invest it with i.e 5x leverage, since the companies like Microsoft are stable, and eventually will grow? Stock Math - let's say I invest $10.000 in a stock and it declines -50%. I know have $5.000. If it goes up by 50%, do I get $7.500 or do I get my $10.000 back? Logically the first answer, but something doesn't give me a peace of mind here, so I prefer to ask Eli Lilly - what do you think about this stock? Growed massive amount lately, and pharmaceutical industry will definitely be there in 5 or 10 years.",0.5565,NEGATIVE,0.9857

The $1 trillion threshold was crossed just two days before the “Oracle of Omaha” turns 94 years old. The shares were up 0.8% to $696,502.02 on Wednesday, allowing it to top the $1 trillion mark, per FactSet. The milestone “is a testament to the firm’s financial strength and franchise value,” said Cathy Seifert, Berkshire analyst at CFRA Research. “This is significant at a time when Berkshire represents one of the few remaining conglomerates in existence today.” Unlike the six other companies in the trillion-dollar club (Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta), Berkshire is known for its old-economy focus as the owner of BNSF Railway, Geico Insurance and Dairy Queen.

They also stand to benefit from SMCI’s issues and Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure.

Fundamentals behind a USA market drop this week & some positives.csv,"The problem areas in the USA: -------------------------- *- The Schiller PE is at a very high level. Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble. So stocks are highly expensive. *- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022! We are more of a service economy than a goods economy, *- World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle. That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local sales declines are offset. Additionally the trade war hampers both sides. *- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels. *- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers. You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term. People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank. However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials. AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth. AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales. So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia. This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW. I don't own any MKSI. This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording. So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN. Good areas: -------------------------------------- *- Labor productivity is up consistently since Q3 2022. one can see tradingeconomics dot com USA productivity *- Gasoline is lower than last year *- Retail sales are going fine, [ per a recent NPR radio article ] Nuetral ---------------------------------------- *- Labor force participation is not higher than Sept 2023. No more sales growth from people returning to work. Participation is up recently. tradingeconomics has this info. *- Consumer confidence is still down since January 2020.

Liz Ann Sonders, Chief Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab, pointed out that beneath the surface, the average stock in the Nasdaq has experienced a 37% drawdown, compared to the 7% maximum drawdown of the index from its year-to-date high. This suggests significant churn and rotation not visible when solely looking at index level changes. Further, the share of S&P 500 members trading above their 50-day moving average has dropped below 50%, while the index itself continues to trade above its intermediate-term average by more than 4%.

In 2020, I realized (even with all the controversy they had) Nvidia was doing really good, they also had their investments in a lot of technologies finally start to pay off and even if you exclude the c rypt0 frenzy it was somewhat clear that Nvidia was nourishing. At least to me as a programmer, I thought they had a ton of technological dominance and advancements in various areas. And especially in 2022 when AI stuff popped up, if it wasn't clear before that with all the research and investments they were doing in AI/ML space, like it should be clear by that point with image generation, LLMs and OpenAI popping off and all of them relying on Nvidia. But the stock price was still at 15 USD at maximum in 2022. At that time I had literally 0 knowledge in the stock market and thought ""Maybe this is Nvidia's value and this value includes all the new things and market is aware of Nvidia."" but in hindsight Nvidia was overly undervalued and the market was simply not aware of it. Maybe it was clear to me because Nvidia is in my domain but am I missing something? For example, I also get the same vibes with Tesla. Yes it is crazily valued at the moment but still with the event they held yesterday and overall their direction, even if everyone hates Elon Musk, it also seems clear to me that Tesla will pack a lot more than what it currently is. The robotaxis, tesla robot, their battery techs, their knowledge in vision and ML and a lot more things will start to pay off eventually.

"Impacting NVDA is underlying logic,what does OpenAI is change in strategy mean.csv","Big model pre-training bottleneck: Silicon Valley AI labs are generally struggling with new model training, with OpenAI's Orion and Google's Gemini 2.0 failing to significantly outperform their predecessors, defying the “law of scaling”. This law used to mean that model performance would continue to increase with data and computation, but the scaling effect has now plateaued. Computing in the reasoning phase: To overcome pre-training bottlenecks, OpenAI and other labs are exploring “compute on test” techniques that enable human-like multi-step reasoning by allowing models to generate and evaluate multiple possibilities in real-time during the reasoning phase. This approach can be used more effectively for complex tasks such as mathematics and coding to optimize reasoning performance. Hardware Demand Shift: Market demand is likely to shift from large-scale pre-training clusters to inference clouds as new technologies reduce parameter requirements. This will weaken NVIDIA's monopoly in the training chip market, and the inference chip market may see more competition, especially as companies such as Groq may fill the new demand. Capital Trends: Venture capital organizations are highly concerned about this change, and are gradually investing more resources in distributed inference clouds to cater to the distributed server needs of inference computing.",0.5346,POSITIVE,0.6048

Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,NEGATIVE,0.9443

With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia’s chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like AMD are gaining steam, and Nvidia’s own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant. How that plays out over the next few years is anyone’s guess.

In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions. It’s an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve’s inflation battle, noted FactSet’s Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post. The 10 top performing days for the S&P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%. The S&P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday’s close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%. Through Dec. 22, the S&P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%. Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said. That didn’t mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote. Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found. Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July. The strategy “indicates the Fed’s measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,” Jakobsen said. The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks’ bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group’s announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering. SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a “mini” banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown. Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks — Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78% , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, 0.16%, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%, Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%, Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%, and Meta Platforms Inc. META, 0.56%. See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024? Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind. The S&P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted. In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high: The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&P 500’s weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted. Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&P 500’s overall return, he wrote, with the company’s success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.",0.5482,NEGATIVE,0.9995
Mega-caps vs small caps.csv,"The current state of the stock market exhibits a stark contrast between the performance of mega-cap and small-cap stocks, as investors grapple with mixed signals from major corporations and broader market indices.  Recent developments have highlighted this divide, with Microsoft's upcoming earnings report set to further shape the narrative. Mega-Cap Weakness and Market Impact Microsoft, a key player in the technology sector, is set to report its earnings after the market close, and its performance could significantly influence investor sentiment.  The recent underperformance of large-cap stocks like Merck and Procter & Gamble, both of which have disappointed with earnings guidance, has contributed to the Nasdaq Composite's (-0.9%) and S&P 500's (-0.4%) downward pressure.  This weakness is reflected in the Vanguard Mega-Cap Growth ETF (MGK), which is down 1.1%. Small-Cap Resilience In contrast, small-cap stocks have shown relative strength, with the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 Value Index posting gains.  The equal-weighted S&P 500 is also holding its own, indicating that smaller companies are providing a stabilizing force in the market.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, buoyed by the financials and energy sectors, adds to this resilience. Sectors in Focus The IT sector, weighed down by NVIDIA's (-5.0%) decline ahead of AMD's earnings release, is leading the pack of losers.  Consumer staples, also negatively impacted, are lagging behind. On the other hand, financials, and energy sectors are posting gains, offering a glimmer of hope for investors seeking opportunities. Treasuries and Market Sentiment The Treasury market remains relatively calm, with the 2-yr note yield down to 4.38% and the 10-yr note yield at 4.17%.  Economic indicators, such as the better-than-expected consumer confidence index and the Bank of Japan's policy decision, have not sparked significant market movements, suggesting that investors are cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's FOMC decision on Wednesday. As we await Microsoft's earnings report, the stock market's divide between mega-cap and small-cap stocks is a cause for concern, especially for those relying on large-cap performance.  However, the resilience of small-cap companies and select sectors is providing a silver lining. Investors should stay vigilant, monitor market reactions to key earnings releases, and consider a diversified portfolio that takes into account the current market dynamics.  The Federal Reserve's decision will likely play a crucial role in determining the market's next course of action.",0.5419,NEGATIVE,0.9136

MSFT faces long-term potential disadvantages.csv,"I think one of the main reasons Microsoft is a great long-term investment is its long history of generating a lot of free cash flow. At the time of writing, the company's free cash flow margin is over 30%, with free cash flow rising from $15.9 billion in 2009 to $74.1 billion in the last 12 months. This financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments. While Microsoft may not seem like a value investment, in my opinion, its pricing is reasonable given its continued revenue and earnings growth, and it's likely to continue for the foreseeable future. I estimate EPS growth of 13% on a regular basis over the next 12 months. Based on this projection, I have a price target of $482.40 and estimate that the stock will trade at a non-GAAP P/E ratio of around 36. Looking ahead, I expect Microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15% over the next 5 to 10 years. While this prospect necessitates buying the stock at a fair valuation, I believe the current price provides an opportunity. The company's forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is only 6.5% above its five-year average, while its forward diluted earnings per share growth rate is nearly the same at 5.8%. MSFT faces long-term potential headwinds One potential challenge to Microsoft's long-term growth in AI is that its adoption can be cyclical. Currently, the demand for AI systems is high, which has prompted Microsoft and other big tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion. However, when the current trend peaks (likely due to macroeconomic constraints), growth may slow. According to the TipRanks risk analysis tool, Microsoft is exposed to 32% risk from legal and regulatory factors, which is higher than the industry average and could impact its AI operations due to increased scrutiny of data privacy and AI governance. Given this outlook, I expect some volatility in Microsoft's long-term growth trajectory, although it may not be as good as NVIDIA NVDA -0.06% ▼ and so on semiconductor companies so obvious. As market sentiment fluctuates, cyclical price and valuation declines coincide with temporarily lower growth rates and may provide more attractive buying opportunities. There is also a risk that Microsoft and other Big Tech players could over-invest in AI infrastructure. With 21% of its risk related to Tech & Innovation, Microsoft’s heavy investment in AI-driven initiatives, including data center infrastructure, could result in lower-than-expected returns if industry growth does not meet expectations. This may impact free cash flow margins in the medium term, contributing to further volatility.",0.5607,NEGATIVE,0.8794

Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is on a path to exceed its earnings expectations next month when its Q3 report comes out. While an earnings beat is not fully guaranteed, the latest earnings results of the company’s peers, suppliers, clients, and businesses that have a connection to the generative AI industry point to Nvidia having a stellar performance in Q3. The demand for its AI GPUs remains high, the company has been receiving upward revisions recently, and its stock is trading around its all-time high levels with a potential to appreciate even further in the upcoming months.

Nvidia announces 50 billion stock buyback.csv,"Nvidia said Wednesday that its board of directors has approved a $50 billion stock buyback. The computer chip giant announced the share repurchase as part of its fiscal second-quarter earnings, in which it reported earnings and guidance that surpassed Wall Street expectations. Nvidia returned $15.4 billion to shareholders in share repurposes and cash dividends as part of the company’s first half of its fiscal 2025. The company said it had $7.5 billion remaining under its share repurchase plan, as of the end of its fiscal second quarter. Last year, Nvidia announced a $25 billion share buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results. Companies often experience a boom to their stock price after revealing stock buyback plans. In May, for instance, Apple announced a $110 billion stock buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results that showed overall sales fell 4% year over year and iPhone sales dropped 10% year over year. However, the iPhone maker’s shares rose 7% in after-hours trading, likely because Apple’s share buyback was the biggest in corporate history. With Nvidia’s shares dropping 4% in extended trading despite reporting solid financial results and announcing a stock buyback, some experts believe the company has been doing so well that it is getting harder to impress investors.

Nvidia More Room to Run Just Getting Started.csv,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they’ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don’t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical. Yes, Nvidia’s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn’t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now. Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn’t possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia’s place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn’t happened and Nvidia’s only gotten stronger. That’s not to say over time Nvidia won’t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it’s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution. Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations.

Powell's comments on interest rates, the economy, and any indication that inflationary pressures are driving a reassessment of the Fed's present aims will be scrutinized.

Lowe's, BJ's Wholesale Club, and Peloton are also set to announce earnings this week. August is shaping up to be the worst month for stocks this year, with all three main averages closing last week lower after a hawkish read of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting sent equities lower and Treasury rates higher in the second half of the week. Economic data continues to come in stronger than expected, with the July retail sales report indicating a 0.7% increase in sales for the month, about double what economists forecast. The AtlantaFed's GDPNow projection now predicts third-quarter GDP growth of 5.8%, the strongest rate since the fourth quarter of 2021.

Powell has stated as recently as July that inflation is ""well above"" the Fed's long-run objective of 2%.

"Oracle bumps up fiscal 2026 revenue forecast, lifting stock 6%.csv","Oracle lifted its fiscal 2026 revenue forecast on Thursday, pushing its stock up nearly 6% in after-hours trading. The tech giant now anticipates at least $66 billion in revenue for fiscal 2026, about $1.5 billion higher than analysts’ estimates. Looking further ahead, Oracle projects over $104 billion in revenue by fiscal 2029, along with a 20% year-over-year growth in earnings per share. Speaking at the Oracle CloudWorld event in Las Vegas, CEO Safra Catz expressed confidence in achieving these ambitious targets, pointing to new partnerships that allow Oracle’s database software to be offered through major cloud providers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Oracle’s strong performance continued this week as its stock gained roughly 15% over the past three trading days, setting a new record and marking a 55% increase for the year—second only to Nvidia among large-cap tech companies. Oracle’s cloud infrastructure revenue jumped 45% last quarter, outpacing its competitors and benefiting from businesses transitioning their workloads to the cloud. The company is also positioning itself to capitalize on the growing demand for artificial intelligence, announcing its cloud unit has secured orders for over 131,000 next-generation Nvidia GPUs. As Oracle scales up its cloud and AI capabilities, it plans to double its capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 to support this growth, signaling continued momentum in its expansion efforts.

Qualcomm Approached Intel About a Takeover in Recent Days.csv,"Qualcomm recently approached Intel with a takeover proposal, marking what could be one of the largest tech deals in recent memory, according to sources. Intel, once valued at over $290 billion, has seen its market cap fall to around $90 billion after a challenging year in which its shares dropped 60%. While a deal is far from guaranteed, Qualcomm’s interest comes as Intel struggles to recover under CEO Pat Gelsinger’s turnaround plan, which has yet to deliver significant results. Should Intel be receptive, the deal could face heavy antitrust scrutiny, though some argue it might bolster U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor industry. Qualcomm may consider offloading parts of Intel to complete the acquisition. Both companies have sought to capitalize on the AI boom, though they’ve lagged behind Nvidia. Intel, grappling with factory delays and cost-cutting measures, is receiving government subsidies as part of its efforts to build chip factories. A Qualcomm takeover could enhance its portfolio by adding Intel’s dominance in PCs and servers to its smartphone chip business. Despite this potential merger, Intel continues to face major hurdles, including the possible need to split its design and manufacturing operations amid growing calls for the company to separate its business divisions.

Not exactly surprising to see these giants at the top of the list. The year is 2044... does the top eight look relatively similar to what it looks like now? Feels hard to argue otherwise.

Serious question from someone who took a four-year trading break.csv,Hey everyone After a long long hiatus and licking my wounds I decided to try trading once again. Recently I've been changing up my approach and doing 5-7 DTE spy options. And it's been going pretty decent however recently I got a couple of August 30th calls for Nvidia I managed to get in at a good position for 133 calls. My thesis is that it's going to keep pumping up to the day of earnings. I don't have any intention of holding the position up until expiration. My question is regarding theta decay and volatility. I know that the closer I got to the expiration the less profit I'll see as a percentage of my position. And I also understand that during high levels of volatility it can go both ways. And I'm not really asking for specific advice just kind of guidance or knowledge as to how that may affect my position. I'm holding them over the weekend and I'm expecting Monday to start off a little red but to finish off green and so I'm not quite sure if I want to sell half my positions and wait till earnings or if I should wait to earnings in general. I strongly believe that Nvidia is going to beat their earnings I just don't know how drastically that's going to affect the price action. Any and all input is definitely appreciated Thanks in advance,0.5421,NEGATIVE,0.9936

Super Micro Falls as Hindenburg Takes Aim With Short Report.csv,"Super Micro Computer Inc.'s shares took a hit on Tuesday following a short report from Hindenburg Research that questioned the company's financial practices and transparency. Hindenburg's report alleged significant accounting red flags, undisclosed related-party transactions, and potential violations of sanctions and export controls. Initially, the report caused Super Micro's stock to plummet by as much as 8.7%, but it later rebounded to close down 2.6%. The server manufacturer has been a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, with its high-performance servers in high demand for data centers. This surge in AI-related demand has driven significant growth for the company, doubling its revenue to $14.9 billion in the most recent fiscal year. Despite a steep decline from its March peak, Super Micro's stock remains up over 90% for the year, reflecting continued investor interest in the burgeoning AI sector. However, the Hindenburg report could intensify scrutiny on Super Micro's accounting practices and client relationships, particularly as the company has faced regulatory challenges in the past. In 2020, Super Micro resolved a U.S. SEC investigation by correcting its financial statements and paying a penalty for accounting issues from 2014 to 2017. As the AI market continues to expand, maintaining investor confidence will be crucial for Super Micro, especially amid concerns about the profitability of AI-optimized servers and the potential for increased regulatory oversight.

Technical Analysis Lesson - Reversal Day in Nvidia (NVDA).csv,"Every trader wants to know when the trend is changing from up to down or down to up. This happens when the leadership in the market changes from bulls to bears or bears to bulls. These trend changes are what every trader looks for. If they can accurately predict market turns, they can profit. That’s why they do what they do. Sometimes this change of leadership is slow and takes a long period of time to happen. These changes have price action that tends to show up on a chart as a ‘Rounded Top’ or ‘Rounded Bottom’ pattern. Sometimes the reversal is abrupt and takes place over a few time periods. This action tends to show up on a chart as a ‘V’ or ‘Inverted V’ reversal. But sometimes the trend changes just in one day... These dynamics can show up on a chart as a ‘Reversal Day’ pattern. One may have just happened in the stock of Nivida (NVDA). The Western world would call it an ‘Outside Reversal Day’. In candlestick terminology, it is called a ‘Bearish Engulfing Pattern’. It’s important to note that these candlestick patterns are at least 700 years old. They were developed by Japanese rice traders. It shows that the human nature which is illustrated in charts hasn’t changed. The name doesn’t matter. The action that it illustrates does. On Friday morning, it looked as though the uptrend in NVDA was going to continue for yet another day. It opened at a higher price than Thursday’s close. But then the tide turned… Over the day, the sellers came out of the woodwork. And not only did they hold off the assault. They overpowered the buyers and eventually pushed the price much lower. Importantly, Friday’s closing price was lower than Thursday’s opening price. This is frequently a characteristic of a trend that is reversing. Sometimes the change of leadership from bulls to bears happens over an extended time-period. But sometimes it occurs in just one day. That could be the case here.",0.5201,NEGATIVE,0.9938

TSM investment.csv,"Does anyone have any opinions on if this is a good investment? Given the recent AI boom everyone is focused on big players such as NVIDIA and AMD, but they are both supplied heavily by TSM for their chips. I don’t see much competition for TSM given they are so far advanced ahead of any American or Chinese competitor, and given the only increase in demand for AI technology, I don’t see how they wouldn’t grow. Yes the stock is expensive right now, but given the growth opportunity I would argue there is still plenty of room for expansion. Yes, China is a threat, but something tells me that China would not dare suffer the economic sanctions western nations would impose if they made a move in Taiwan. Trump has said he would likely put tariffs on the Taiwan semiconductor industry in order to grow domestic production, but still with tariffs, I don’t see big players switching to alternatives, as the gap between TSM and alternatives is very large.

TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand.csv,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

TSMC thoughts.csv,"TSMC went on a tear so far this year and they seem to be poised for higher growth since they are struggling to even meet demand for their chips right now. Along with main clients like NVIDIA and AMD and APPLE looked to work on AI. HPC revenue has growth i think 30% in their last 2 quarters. They are also mass producing 3nm chips which is starting to make up a nice chunk of their revenue. My main concern is obviously china but also that they are too tied to nvidia. Whenever i see them in the market, if NVIDIA is up 3%, they are up 6%, but if NVIDIA is down 3%, they are down 6-7%. Is it still a buy even though it has risen almost 50% this year?

Understand this about INTC.csv,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting. It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation. I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors: Expense Ratio: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. Stock Selection Methodology: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. Performance Trends: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. Portfolio Diversification: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. Market Positioning: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. Innovative Approach of SoFi: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy. It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.

"Why Are Analysts Increasing NVIDIA’s Price Target Is It Out of Fear That Something Bad Will Happen, .csv","NVIDIA, often considered the heart of AI stocks, has recently been in the spotlight as analysts uniformly raise their stock targets. To me, this trend seems somewhat peculiar, even considering the current earnings season. The buoyant optimism surrounding the stock’s potential rise is sparking doubt in my mind. Should the stock underperform, it will be a litmus test of these analysts’ sincerity, raising questions about whether they may be manipulating public sentiment. In the broader context of the semiconductor sector, the recent quarterly earnings have been largely underwhelming. Yet, all semiconductor stocks appear to be buoyed by NVIDIA’s momentum. A stumble in NVIDIA’s stock could trigger a broader tech market downfall, while success could reignite a bullish trend for tech stocks. My intuition, however, leans towards a potential disappointment. NVIDIA might surpass current estimates but simultaneously lower their future guidance due to sluggish growth. Should this occur, a significant drop in stock price could follow. Disclaimer: These thoughts are purely my own observations and should not be taken as financial advice.",0.542,NEGATIVE,0.9983

It continues to grow today, and to play a high-quality video game, you would need an NVIDIA video card. Cryp* boom: This started in the early 2010s and continues to this day.

Worse case scenario the perfect Bear cocktail.csv,"After reading all the comments from my last post and doing some more thinking. I decided to entertain the idea of what would be the perfect Bear cocktail that could trigger a Stock Market destabilization. I'm not taking into account any type of positive news. I'm simply going the negative route, in a slow and systematic manner, without any huge trigger events. What am I missing and at what dates that's important and could also add to this? If you notice in the prior post list, three out of six times... rising interest rates were part of the cause that brought the market down at least 20%. Oil price shocks two out of 6. Then there´s speculative investments at the dotcom bubble. Covid, overvaluation, trade tensions... Stagflation. So these have to be in the mix one way or another: Cocktail Potential Ingredients: Rising interest rates. Oil price shocks. Speculative tech investments. Overvaluation. Trade tensions. Stagflation. New round of Covid-19. Housing or Commercial Real Estate Bubble. So this is the speculative worse case scenario we could have without going as far as having a WWIII: February 13, 2024: CPI report comes in hot. S&P500 comes down 1.5%, some buy the tiny dip. February 15, 2024: Jobless claims rise. Doesn't alter the market but adds to the cocktail mix. February 16, 2024: A higher-than-expected PPI indicates increasing costs at the producer level, which can signal rising inflationary pressures. Producers might pass these higher costs onto consumers, leading to an increase in consumer prices and overall inflation. The Fed to consider tightening monetary policy more aggressively than previously anticipated to combat inflation. This could include raising interest rates or adjusting the pace of tapering asset purchases. Financial markets don't react negatively to a higher-than-expected PPI, as it they priced it in from the CPI report. February 21, 2024: Nvidia posts earnings, they actually do fine but investors realize that´s gonna be the ceiling for now so the stock falls 15%. Other tech stocks get stained by the fear, bringing the S&P500 2.5% lower. AI investment sentiments leans towards potentially speculative for now. March 12, 2024: February´s CPI report comes in hot again, causing Algorithmic trades to sell and bring down the S&P500 another 2%. March 19-20, 2024: FOMC Meeting gives subtext of potentially not bringing interest rates down yet. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterates emphasis on the central bank's commitment to combating inflation, even if it requires keeping interest rates high for an extended period. This brings down the market sentiment down and numbers another 1%. April 5, 2024: In a CNBC YouTube video report, experts delve into the complexities of the current commercial real estate (CRE) market. The rise of remote work led to a decreased demand for office spaces, the pandemic trained people to make purchases online, commercial real estate bubble starts to show symptoms of cracking up. April 10, 2024: CPI report is on ambiguous. Not up, not down. Anything could happen at this point. Aprils report will define what the FED will do and the next 6 months of stock market activity. Market loses .5% April 17, 2024: Tom Lee's bullish perspective has been challenged by the prior events and during an interview he mentions that this was the turmoil he had been expecting but sees the S&P500 going back to 5,200 points by the end of the year. Currently at 4,600... 7.5% below all time highs. May 1, 2024: FOMC Meeting leaves a bad taste in mouth. Jerome shifts narrative towards not lowering interests rates yet. Market falls another 2.5% on the bad sentiment. May 15, 2024: Situations in the Middle East, such as tensions in Gaza or Iran, could impact global oil supplies by affecting regional stability and energy infrastructure. Saudi Arabia, a key OPEC member, might alter its oil production strategy in response to shifts in global politics, economic pressures, or changes in energy demand. Actions perceived as irrational could stem from strategic decisions to protect national interests, influence oil prices, or respond to international events. S&P500 falls 0.5%. July 8, 2024: A new wave of Covid-19 actually breaks through the collective deceit of it being over because death rates rise significantly and word spreads out again from hospital staff that's it's getting real bad. Stock market reacts in a mixed manner. Amazon and tech companies go up a little, small caps enter another bad rout. S&P500 falls 1%. July 20, 2024: Numbers start to confirm a Stagflation situation actually taking place. A significant slowdown in economic growth, rising unemployment rates, declining consumer spending, and a contraction in manufacturing.

AMD to acquire server builder ZT Systems for 49 billion in cash and stock.csv,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced on Monday its plans to acquire server manufacturer ZT Systems for $4.9 billion, as part of its strategy to bolster its portfolio of artificial intelligence (AI) chips and hardware, and to compete more effectively against Nvidia. The acquisition will be financed with 75% cash and the remaining in stock, leveraging AMD’s $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments reported in the second quarter. The rising demands of AI computing have necessitated the use of thousands of interconnected chips to achieve the required processing power, making the design and construction of server systems increasingly critical. This acquisition will enable AMD to enhance its capabilities in this area. According to AMD CEO Lisa Su, the addition of ZT Systems’ engineers will accelerate the company’s ability to test and deploy its latest AI GPUs on a scale required by major cloud computing companies like Microsoft. Although AMD plans to incorporate ZT Systems into its operations, it has no intention of competing directly in the server manufacturing market. Instead, the company plans to divest its server manufacturing business after the acquisition is finalized, with no discussions yet held with potential buyers. ZT Systems CEO Frank Zhang will join AMD, reporting to Forrest Norrod, AMD’s data center chief. The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2025, will see AMD retaining about 1,000 of ZT Systems' roughly 2,500 employees.

AMZN Earnings Preview- What to watch for tonight.csv,"Earnings from Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. will be crucial in guiding the Nasdaq 100 after a volatile period marked by extreme fluctuations. As the last megacaps to release results before Nvidia Corp. in August, these reports will set the tone for tech investors, particularly focusing on how artificial intelligence is driving growth in Amazon’s cloud-computing unit and boosting demand for Apple's next iPhone. The results will also provide valuable insights into the health of consumer spending, with Amazon shares already up about 25% this year. Amazon.com Inc. is set to release its Q2 earnings report after the market closes, with a conference call scheduled for 5:30 p.m. ET. Analysts project the company will report revenue of $148.8 billion, marking an 11% increase year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up from 65 cents in the same period last year. Amazon has guided for Q2 operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, signaling strong performance despite broader economic challenges. Key metrics expected by analysts include AWS revenue at nearly $26 billion, representing more than 17% year-over-year growth, and advertising revenue projected to reach $13 billion, a 21.7% increase from last year. The Stores segment, bolstered by events like Prime Day, is anticipated to show significant activity, while improvements in operating margins, especially in the North America segment, will be closely watched. Analysts also expect updates on AI initiatives and the overall capital expenditures for the year. Comments from analysts emphasize the importance of AI and cloud services for Amazon's future growth. Citi analysts, led by Ronald Josey, anticipate AWS revenue growth accelerated in Q2 due to generative AI tailwinds, while also predicting a beat in operating income thanks to improved retail efficiencies and strong advertising demand. Truist analyst Youssef Squali highlights Amazon's ability to gain share in global e-commerce and sees multiple growth vectors powering the company's continued expansion. Retail performance and consumer spending trends will be significant indicators, especially given mixed reports this earnings season. Analysts like Matt Stucky of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management note the importance of Amazon's retail margin expansion and its impact on profitability. Additionally, the potential for a surprise dividend announcement is a point of interest, as Amazon remains the last major tech company without a dividend program. Amazon's Q2 results will follow earnings reports from key competitors like Microsoft and Google, both of which had mixed receptions based on their cloud and AI performances. Wall Street's current focus is on tangible returns from AI investments, making Amazon's updates on its AI initiatives and AWS growth crucial for investor sentiment. The company's dominant position in the cloud market and ongoing efforts to enhance its e-commerce offerings will be under the microscope. Amazon saw its stock rise following a strong Q1 earnings report, showcasing impressive upside in both EPS and revenue. The standout metric was a significant 221% year-over-year increase in operating income to $15.31 billion, far surpassing the prior guidance of $8-12 billion. The company’s guidance for Q2 operating income of $10-14 billion also exceeded expectations. The Stores segment performed well, driven by successful shopping events like Amazon's Spring Deal Days in Europe and the first Big Spring Sale in Canada and the US. Faster delivery times, enhanced by regionalization efforts and cost-saving measures such as consolidating units into fewer boxes, boosted customer purchase frequency and overall spend. Additionally, Amazon is preparing for its 10th Prime Day event in July, which is expected to further drive sales. Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the highlight of the quarter, with a 17% growth in constant currency, an improvement from previous quarters. AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue business, with significant growth in both generative and non-generative AI workloads. The Advertising Services segment also showed robust growth, with a 24% increase in revenue to $11.82 billion, driven primarily by sponsored ads and early gains in Prime Video ads. Despite guiding Q2 revenue below consensus due to foreign exchange impacts, the strong performance in AWS and advertising has left investors optimistic.",0.5699,POSITIVE,0.9923

Some of it just recovered from 2022 to it's pre-2022 state, but Nvidia has 205% growth this year, which is crazy Index funds - the legendary S&P 500. Everyone says it's the most stable etc - but I've found other indexes with even better growth. SP500 usually have the 7-10% yearly return and last 5 years went up 56%, but for example the INDEX Vanguard Growth ETF went up 87% for the last 5 years - and it was also a steady growth, not a lucky spike during one period. What do you think, is it really smart to go with SP500 or are there other ones that are much better, even tho SP500 is so hyped by everyone? and if you agree - what other indexes with better return would you recommend? Leverage - I'm not familiar with how much can you leverage in stocks, but for people that invest in the top 10, which most likely will go up in the future, wouldn't be smarter to invest it with i.e 5x leverage, since the companies like Microsoft are stable, and eventually will grow? Stock Math - let's say I invest $10.000 in a stock and it declines -50%. I know have $5.000. If it goes up by 50%, do I get $7.500 or do I get my $10.000 back?

"Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway hits 1 trillion market value, first US company outside of tech to do so.csv","Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reached a $1 trillion market capitalization on Wednesday, the first nontechnology company in the U.S. to score the coveted milestone. Shares of the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate have rallied more than 28% in 2024, far above the S&P 500′s 18% gain. The $1 trillion threshold was crossed just two days before the “Oracle of Omaha” turns 94 years old. The shares were up 0.8% to $696,502.02 on Wednesday, allowing it to top the $1 trillion mark, per FactSet. The milestone “is a testament to the firm’s financial strength and franchise value,” said Cathy Seifert, Berkshire analyst at CFRA Research. “This is significant at a time when Berkshire represents one of the few remaining conglomerates in existence today.” Unlike the six other companies in the trillion-dollar club (Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta), Berkshire is known for its old-economy focus as the owner of BNSF Railway, Geico Insurance and Dairy Queen.

Fundamentals behind a USA market drop this week & some positives.csv,"The problem areas in the USA: -------------------------- *- The Schiller PE is at a very high level. Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble. So stocks are highly expensive. *- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022! We are more of a service economy than a goods economy, *- World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle. That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local sales declines are offset. Additionally the trade war hampers both sides. *- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels. *- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers. You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term. People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank. However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials. AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth. AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales. So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia. This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW. I don't own any MKSI. This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording. So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN. Good areas: -------------------------------------- *- Labor productivity is up consistently since Q3 2022. one can see tradingeconomics dot com USA productivity *- Gasoline is lower than last year *- Retail sales are going fine, [ per a recent NPR radio article ] Nuetral ---------------------------------------- *- Labor force participation is not higher than Sept 2023. No more sales growth from people returning to work. Participation is up recently. tradingeconomics has this info. *- Consumer confidence is still down since January 2020.

"Impacting NVDA is underlying logic,what does OpenAI is change in strategy mean.csv","Big model pre-training bottleneck: Silicon Valley AI labs are generally struggling with new model training, with OpenAI's Orion and Google's Gemini 2.0 failing to significantly outperform their predecessors, defying the “law of scaling”. This law used to mean that model performance would continue to increase with data and computation, but the scaling effect has now plateaued. Computing in the reasoning phase: To overcome pre-training bottlenecks, OpenAI and other labs are exploring “compute on test” techniques that enable human-like multi-step reasoning by allowing models to generate and evaluate multiple possibilities in real-time during the reasoning phase. This approach can be used more effectively for complex tasks such as mathematics and coding to optimize reasoning performance. Hardware Demand Shift: Market demand is likely to shift from large-scale pre-training clusters to inference clouds as new technologies reduce parameter requirements. This will weaken NVIDIA's monopoly in the training chip market, and the inference chip market may see more competition, especially as companies such as Groq may fill the new demand. Capital Trends: Venture capital organizations are highly concerned about this change, and are gradually investing more resources in distributed inference clouds to cater to the distributed server needs of inference computing.",0.5346,POSITIVE,0.6048

"Intel Aims For 1 Billion Software Revenue By 2027, According To CTO Greg Lavender.csv","Intel's Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Greg Lavender has stated that the company is making smooth progress in the software domain. By the end of 2027, the cumulative revenue from its software business could reach $1 billion. In 2021, Intel achieved over $100 million in software revenue. It was during this year that CEO Pat Gelsinger brought Lavender from cloud computing company VMware to guide the chipmaker's software strategy. Since then, Intel has acquired three software companies. I have a goal of getting to $1 billion of software and developer cloud subscription revenue, Lavender said, I think I'm on track to hit this goal by the end of 2027 ... maybe sooner. Intel generated $54 billion in revenue in 2023, offering a range of software services and tools for rent, from cloud computing to artificial intelligence. Lavender said that his strategy is to focus on providing services in artificial intelligence, performance, and security, and the company has been investing in these three areas. Additionally, he also stated that Intel has seen lots of demand for its upcoming Gaudi 3 chip, and he believes this can help the company take second place in the AI chip market.

Intel Corporation INTC’s Latest Strides and Challenges.csv,"Key Takeaways: Innovation and expansion in new tech frontiers are key growth drivers. Long-term outlook hinges on successful execution of strategic initiatives. Intel unveils new AI chip to compete with Nvidia and AMD Intel’s total revenue in Q3 2023 was $14.2 billion, marking an 8% decrease from Q3 2022. Company Overview: Intel Corporation, a global technology leader, has been at the forefront of innovation in the semiconductor industry. Founded in 1968, Intel’s contributions have been pivotal in the evolution of computing technologies. The company specializes in manufacturing microprocessors, chipsets, embedded processors, and network interface controllers, among others. Intel’s Strategic Pivot Amidst Market Flux Recent times have been a mix of challenges and opportunities for Intel. The company, once the undisputed leader in semiconductor technology, faces fierce competition from rivals like AMD and NVIDIA, who have made significant inroads into Intel’s market share. The rise of ARM-based processors and the increasing demand for specialized chips for AI and data centers add to the competitive pressure. Intel’s response to these challenges has been multi-pronged. The company has accelerated its innovation cycle, focusing on next-generation chip technologies. Under the leadership of CEO Pat Gelsinger, Intel announced a significant investment in expanding its manufacturing capabilities, aiming to not only meet its own chip demands but also offer foundry services to other chipmakers. Moreover, Intel is actively diversifying its product portfolio. Its recent advancements in AI, edge computing, and autonomous driving technologies signify a strategic shift.  Leading AI models, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, predominantly utilize Nvidia GPUs hosted in cloud environments. This reliance has contributed to Nvidia’s stock soaring by approximately 230% since the beginning of the year, in stark contrast to Intel’s 68% increase. This trend underlines why competitors like AMD and Intel are now introducing their own chips, aiming to challenge Nvidia’s strong market presence. Although specifics were sparse, Intel’s Gaudi3 is set to rival Nvidia’s H100, a popular choice for entities constructing extensive chip networks for AI operations, and AMD’s upcoming MI300X. The Gaudi3 is expected to begin distribution to clients in 2024. However, these strategic decisions come with their own set of risks. The high cost of chip manufacturing and R&D, coupled with the uncertain global economic landscape, poses significant challenges. The company’s ability to execute its ambitious plans while maintaining financial stability is a key factor to watch in the coming years. Recent Financials: Intel Corporation’s recent financial performance reflects the challenges and resilience of a tech giant in a volatile market. In Q3 2023, the company reported a total revenue of $14.2 billion, a decrease of 8% from the same quarter in the previous year.

Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,NEGATIVE,0.9443

Hi! I’m Dan Howley, the tech editor at Yahoo Finance, and Nvidia has seemingly been at the forefront of virtually everything I’ve covered since ChatGPT hit the scene in 2022. I’ve been covering the tech space for 13 years and tracking Nvidia for even longer. I built my first desktop PC with an Nvidia graphics card in high school and have continued using its products ever since. Now I, like everyone else, am focused on Nvidia’s AI efforts, from reporting on how they’re dealing with the threat of increased competition to attending the company’s GTC conference to chatting with CEO Jensen Huang alongside my colleague Julie Hyman. With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia’s chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like AMD are gaining steam, and Nvidia’s own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant. How that plays out over the next few years is anyone’s guess. In today’s fiscal 2025 third quarter earnings report, Nvidia beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines on the strength of sales of its high-powered AI chips. 💵 Revenue: $35.08B vs $33.2B expected 💲 Adjusted EPS: $0.81 vs $0.74 expected 💾 Data center revenue: $30.8B vs $29B expected Nvidia also said it anticipates revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, for the fiscal fourth quarter.

Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&P 500 gains.csv,"= just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing = The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023 https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9 The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions. It’s an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve’s inflation battle, noted FactSet’s Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post. The 10 top performing days for the S&P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%. The S&P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday’s close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%. Through Dec. 22, the S&P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%. Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said. That didn’t mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote. Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found. Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July. The strategy “indicates the Fed’s measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,” Jakobsen said. The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks’ bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group’s announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering. SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a “mini” banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown. Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks — Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78% , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, 0.16%, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%, Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%, Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%, and Meta Platforms Inc. META, 0.56%. See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024? Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind. The S&P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted. In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high: The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&P 500’s weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted. Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&P 500’s overall return, he wrote, with the company’s success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.",0.5482,NEGATIVE,0.9995
Mega-caps vs small caps.csv,"The current state of the stock market exhibits a stark contrast between the performance of mega-cap and small-cap stocks, as investors grapple with mixed signals from major corporations and broader market indices.  Recent developments have highlighted this divide, with Microsoft's upcoming earnings report set to further shape the narrative. Mega-Cap Weakness and Market Impact Microsoft, a key player in the technology sector, is set to report its earnings after the market close, and its performance could significantly influence investor sentiment.  The recent underperformance of large-cap stocks like Merck and Procter & Gamble, both of which have disappointed with earnings guidance, has contributed to the Nasdaq Composite's (-0.9%) and S&P 500's (-0.4%) downward pressure.  This weakness is reflected in the Vanguard Mega-Cap Growth ETF (MGK), which is down 1.1%. Small-Cap Resilience In contrast, small-cap stocks have shown relative strength, with the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 Value Index posting gains.  The equal-weighted S&P 500 is also holding its own, indicating that smaller companies are providing a stabilizing force in the market.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, buoyed by the financials and energy sectors, adds to this resilience. Sectors in Focus The IT sector, weighed down by NVIDIA's (-5.0%) decline ahead of AMD's earnings release, is leading the pack of losers.  Consumer staples, also negatively impacted, are lagging behind. On the other hand, financials, and energy sectors are posting gains, offering a glimmer of hope for investors seeking opportunities. Treasuries and Market Sentiment The Treasury market remains relatively calm, with the 2-yr note yield down to 4.38% and the 10-yr note yield at 4.17%.  Economic indicators, such as the better-than-expected consumer confidence index and the Bank of Japan's policy decision, have not sparked significant market movements, suggesting that investors are cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's FOMC decision on Wednesday. As we await Microsoft's earnings report, the stock market's divide between mega-cap and small-cap stocks is a cause for concern, especially for those relying on large-cap performance.  However, the resilience of small-cap companies and select sectors is providing a silver lining. Investors should stay vigilant, monitor market reactions to key earnings releases, and consider a diversified portfolio that takes into account the current market dynamics.  The Federal Reserve's decision will likely play a crucial role in determining the market's next course of action.",0.5419,NEGATIVE,0.9136

MSFT faces long-term potential disadvantages.csv,"I think one of the main reasons Microsoft is a great long-term investment is its long history of generating a lot of free cash flow. At the time of writing, the company's free cash flow margin is over 30%, with free cash flow rising from $15.9 billion in 2009 to $74.1 billion in the last 12 months. This financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments. While Microsoft may not seem like a value investment, in my opinion, its pricing is reasonable given its continued revenue and earnings growth, and it's likely to continue for the foreseeable future. I estimate EPS growth of 13% on a regular basis over the next 12 months. Based on this projection, I have a price target of $482.40 and estimate that the stock will trade at a non-GAAP P/E ratio of around 36. Looking ahead, I expect Microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15% over the next 5 to 10 years. While this prospect necessitates buying the stock at a fair valuation, I believe the current price provides an opportunity. The company's forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is only 6.5% above its five-year average, while its forward diluted earnings per share growth rate is nearly the same at 5.8%. MSFT faces long-term potential headwinds One potential challenge to Microsoft's long-term growth in AI is that its adoption can be cyclical. Currently, the demand for AI systems is high, which has prompted Microsoft and other big tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion. However, when the current trend peaks (likely due to macroeconomic constraints), growth may slow. According to the TipRanks risk analysis tool, Microsoft is exposed to 32% risk from legal and regulatory factors, which is higher than the industry average and could impact its AI operations due to increased scrutiny of data privacy and AI governance. Given this outlook, I expect some volatility in Microsoft's long-term growth trajectory, although it may not be as good as NVIDIA NVDA -0.06% ▼ and so on semiconductor companies so obvious. As market sentiment fluctuates, cyclical price and valuation declines coincide with temporarily lower growth rates and may provide more attractive buying opportunities. There is also a risk that Microsoft and other Big Tech players could over-invest in AI infrastructure. With 21% of its risk related to Tech & Innovation, Microsoft’s heavy investment in AI-driven initiatives, including data center infrastructure, could result in lower-than-expected returns if industry growth does not meet expectations. This may impact free cash flow margins in the medium term, contributing to further volatility.",0.5607,NEGATIVE,0.8794

Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is on a path to exceed its earnings expectations next month when its Q3 report comes out. While an earnings beat is not fully guaranteed, the latest earnings results of the company’s peers, suppliers, clients, and businesses that have a connection to the generative AI industry point to Nvidia having a stellar performance in Q3. The demand for its AI GPUs remains high, the company has been receiving upward revisions recently, and its stock is trading around its all-time high levels with a potential to appreciate even further in the upcoming months.

Nvidia announces 50 billion stock buyback.csv,"Nvidia said Wednesday that its board of directors has approved a $50 billion stock buyback. The computer chip giant announced the share repurchase as part of its fiscal second-quarter earnings, in which it reported earnings and guidance that surpassed Wall Street expectations. Nvidia returned $15.4 billion to shareholders in share repurposes and cash dividends as part of the company’s first half of its fiscal 2025. The company said it had $7.5 billion remaining under its share repurchase plan, as of the end of its fiscal second quarter. Last year, Nvidia announced a $25 billion share buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results. Companies often experience a boom to their stock price after revealing stock buyback plans. In May, for instance, Apple announced a $110 billion stock buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results that showed overall sales fell 4% year over year and iPhone sales dropped 10% year over year. However, the iPhone maker’s shares rose 7% in after-hours trading, likely because Apple’s share buyback was the biggest in corporate history. With Nvidia’s shares dropping 4% in extended trading despite reporting solid financial results and announcing a stock buyback, some experts believe the company has been doing so well that it is getting harder to impress investors.

Nvidia More Room to Run Just Getting Started.csv,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they’ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don’t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical. Yes, Nvidia’s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn’t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now. Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn’t possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia’s place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn’t happened and Nvidia’s only gotten stronger. That’s not to say over time Nvidia won’t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it’s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution. Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations. I don’t think AI is a bubble but I do think that Nvidia and the market as a whole can get ahead of themselves.

"Nvidia reports earnings, Fed gathers in Jackson Hole What about this week.csv","In the final week of August, investors will be focused on two major events: Nvidia's earnings and the Federal Reserve's annual meeting in Jackson Hole.

Powell's comments on interest rates, the economy, and any indication that inflationary pressures are driving a reassessment of the Fed's present aims will be scrutinized. On the corporate front, Nvidia headlines the earnings story this week, with the chipmaker scheduled to publish data from a quarter that caused the chipmaker to increase its revenue forecast by 50%. Lowe's, BJ's Wholesale Club, and Peloton are also set to announce earnings this week. August is shaping up to be the worst month for stocks this year, with all three main averages closing last week lower after a hawkish read of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting sent equities lower and Treasury rates higher in the second half of the week. Economic data continues to come in stronger than expected, with the July retail sales report indicating a 0.7% increase in sales for the month, about double what economists forecast. The AtlantaFed's GDPNow projection now predicts third-quarter GDP growth of 5.8%, the strongest rate since the fourth quarter of 2021. Inflation has declined dramatically since Powell's Jackson Hole speech last year, when he predicted rates will climb until the ""job is done,"" lowering inflation. Powell has stated as recently as July that inflation is ""well above"" the Fed's long-run objective of 2%. On the corporate front, all eyes will be on Nvidia, which predicted that artificial intelligence demand will increase its current quarter sales projection from $7 billion to $11 billion. Nvidia stock is up about 200% year to date, but its gains have slowed along with the market since mid-July.

Qualcomm Approached Intel About a Takeover in Recent Days.csv,"Qualcomm recently approached Intel with a takeover proposal, marking what could be one of the largest tech deals in recent memory, according to sources. Intel, once valued at over $290 billion, has seen its market cap fall to around $90 billion after a challenging year in which its shares dropped 60%. While a deal is far from guaranteed, Qualcomm’s interest comes as Intel struggles to recover under CEO Pat Gelsinger’s turnaround plan, which has yet to deliver significant results. Should Intel be receptive, the deal could face heavy antitrust scrutiny, though some argue it might bolster U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor industry. Qualcomm may consider offloading parts of Intel to complete the acquisition. Both companies have sought to capitalize on the AI boom, though they’ve lagged behind Nvidia. Intel, grappling with factory delays and cost-cutting measures, is receiving government subsidies as part of its efforts to build chip factories. A Qualcomm takeover could enhance its portfolio by adding Intel’s dominance in PCs and servers to its smartphone chip business.

Then again they probably said similar things in 2004. It just seems like GAFAM will continue to purchase any successful companies of smaller size. Rarely do we see standalone companies anymore (at least big ones).,0.5401,NEGATIVE,0.9989
Serious question from someone who took a four-year trading break.csv,Hey everyone After a long long hiatus and licking my wounds I decided to try trading once again. Recently I've been changing up my approach and doing 5-7 DTE spy options. And it's been going pretty decent however recently I got a couple of August 30th calls for Nvidia I managed to get in at a good position for 133 calls. My thesis is that it's going to keep pumping up to the day of earnings. I don't have any intention of holding the position up until expiration. My question is regarding theta decay and volatility. I know that the closer I got to the expiration the less profit I'll see as a percentage of my position. And I also understand that during high levels of volatility it can go both ways. And I'm not really asking for specific advice just kind of guidance or knowledge as to how that may affect my position. I'm holding them over the weekend and I'm expecting Monday to start off a little red but to finish off green and so I'm not quite sure if I want to sell half my positions and wait till earnings or if I should wait to earnings in general. I strongly believe that Nvidia is going to beat their earnings I just don't know how drastically that's going to affect the price action. Any and all input is definitely appreciated Thanks in advance,0.5421,NEGATIVE,0.9936

Super Micro Falls as Hindenburg Takes Aim With Short Report.csv,"Super Micro Computer Inc.'s shares took a hit on Tuesday following a short report from Hindenburg Research that questioned the company's financial practices and transparency. Hindenburg's report alleged significant accounting red flags, undisclosed related-party transactions, and potential violations of sanctions and export controls. Initially, the report caused Super Micro's stock to plummet by as much as 8.7%, but it later rebounded to close down 2.6%. The server manufacturer has been a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, with its high-performance servers in high demand for data centers. This surge in AI-related demand has driven significant growth for the company, doubling its revenue to $14.9 billion in the most recent fiscal year. Despite a steep decline from its March peak, Super Micro's stock remains up over 90% for the year, reflecting continued investor interest in the burgeoning AI sector. However, the Hindenburg report could intensify scrutiny on Super Micro's accounting practices and client relationships, particularly as the company has faced regulatory challenges in the past. In 2020, Super Micro resolved a U.S. SEC investigation by correcting its financial statements and paying a penalty for accounting issues from 2014 to 2017. As the AI market continues to expand, maintaining investor confidence will be crucial for Super Micro, especially amid concerns about the profitability of AI-optimized servers and the potential for increased regulatory oversight.

Technical Analysis Lesson - Reversal Day in Nvidia (NVDA).csv,"Every trader wants to know when the trend is changing from up to down or down to up. This happens when the leadership in the market changes from bulls to bears or bears to bulls. These trend changes are what every trader looks for. If they can accurately predict market turns, they can profit. That’s why they do what they do. Sometimes this change of leadership is slow and takes a long period of time to happen. These changes have price action that tends to show up on a chart as a ‘Rounded Top’ or ‘Rounded Bottom’ pattern. Sometimes the reversal is abrupt and takes place over a few time periods. This action tends to show up on a chart as a ‘V’ or ‘Inverted V’ reversal. But sometimes the trend changes just in one day... These dynamics can show up on a chart as a ‘Reversal Day’ pattern. One may have just happened in the stock of Nivida (NVDA). The Western world would call it an ‘Outside Reversal Day’. In candlestick terminology, it is called a ‘Bearish Engulfing Pattern’. It’s important to note that these candlestick patterns are at least 700 years old. They were developed by Japanese rice traders. It shows that the human nature which is illustrated in charts hasn’t changed. The name doesn’t matter. The action that it illustrates does. On Friday morning, it looked as though the uptrend in NVDA was going to continue for yet another day. It opened at a higher price than Thursday’s close. But then the tide turned… Over the day, the sellers came out of the woodwork. And not only did they hold off the assault. They overpowered the buyers and eventually pushed the price much lower. Importantly, Friday’s closing price was lower than Thursday’s opening price. This is frequently a characteristic of a trend that is reversing. Sometimes the change of leadership from bulls to bears happens over an extended time-period. But sometimes it occurs in just one day. That could be the case here.",0.5201,NEGATIVE,0.9938

TSM investment.csv,"Does anyone have any opinions on if this is a good investment? Given the recent AI boom everyone is focused on big players such as NVIDIA and AMD, but they are both supplied heavily by TSM for their chips. I don’t see much competition for TSM given they are so far advanced ahead of any American or Chinese competitor, and given the only increase in demand for AI technology, I don’t see how they wouldn’t grow. Yes the stock is expensive right now, but given the growth opportunity I would argue there is still plenty of room for expansion. Yes, China is a threat, but something tells me that China would not dare suffer the economic sanctions western nations would impose if they made a move in Taiwan. Trump has said he would likely put tariffs on the Taiwan semiconductor industry in order to grow domestic production, but still with tariffs, I don’t see big players switching to alternatives, as the gap between TSM and alternatives is very large.

TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand.csv,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

TSMC thoughts.csv,"TSMC went on a tear so far this year and they seem to be poised for higher growth since they are struggling to even meet demand for their chips right now.

They are also mass producing 3nm chips which is starting to make up a nice chunk of their revenue. My main concern is obviously china but also that they are too tied to nvidia. Whenever i see them in the market, if NVIDIA is up 3%, they are up 6%, but if NVIDIA is down 3%, they are down 6-7%. Is it still a buy even though it has risen almost 50% this year?

Understand this about INTC.csv,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,NEGATIVE,0.9999

This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings: Data Sources: SPY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Schwab, Yahoo Finance. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST) SFY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Zacks.com, Yahoo Finance. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST) Key Observations: Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting. It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation. I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors: Expense Ratio: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. Stock Selection Methodology: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. Performance Trends: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. Portfolio Diversification: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. Market Positioning: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. Innovative Approach of SoFi: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy. It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.

"Why Are Analysts Increasing NVIDIA’s Price Target Is It Out of Fear That Something Bad Will Happen, .csv","NVIDIA, often considered the heart of AI stocks, has recently been in the spotlight as analysts uniformly raise their stock targets.

Microsoft is privy to specific data regarding demand and metrics for OpenAI’s consumer and enterprise solutions, which serves as a crucial indicator of AI sentiment, second only to Nvidia. Remember the partnership with Apple? 2. AMD’s Earnings Report: AMD has projected significant demand and growth, suggesting a positive trend. If AMD is experiencing this level of demand, it’s worth considering what Nvidia might be experiencing. AMD indicated no signs of slowing down in AI product demand through 2025 and beyond.

Quarterly Highlights: • Earnings per share: 69 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected • Revenue: $5.83 billion vs. $5.72 billion expected • Expected Q3 Sales: $6.7 billion vs. $6.61 billion expected Financial Performance: • Net Income: $265 million (16 cents per share) vs. $27 million (2 cents per share) YoY • Data Center Revenue: Grew 115% YoY to $2.8 billion, driven by AI chip sales (Instinct GPUs) • Client Segment (PCs): Rose 49% YoY to $1.5 billion, indicating a recovering PC market • Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% YoY, below the expected $676 million • Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% YoY, slightly above the expected $856 million AMD’s AI chip sales, reported under the Data Center segment, saw significant growth, highlighting the company’s efforts to compete with Nvidia. AMD’s MI300X AI chip aims to capture market share from Nvidia, which has seen its stock double this year due to high demand for AI GPUs.

Investors are focused on AMD’s ability to grow its AI business, with the company anticipating $4 billion in AI chip sales this year, accounting for 15% of its total expected sales.

AMD to acquire server builder ZT Systems for 49 billion in cash and stock.csv,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced on Monday its plans to acquire server manufacturer ZT Systems for $4.9 billion, as part of its strategy to bolster its portfolio of artificial intelligence (AI) chips and hardware, and to compete more effectively against Nvidia. The acquisition will be financed with 75% cash and the remaining in stock, leveraging AMD’s $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments reported in the second quarter. The rising demands of AI computing have necessitated the use of thousands of interconnected chips to achieve the required processing power, making the design and construction of server systems increasingly critical. This acquisition will enable AMD to enhance its capabilities in this area. According to AMD CEO Lisa Su, the addition of ZT Systems’ engineers will accelerate the company’s ability to test and deploy its latest AI GPUs on a scale required by major cloud computing companies like Microsoft. Although AMD plans to incorporate ZT Systems into its operations, it has no intention of competing directly in the server manufacturing market. Instead, the company plans to divest its server manufacturing business after the acquisition is finalized, with no discussions yet held with potential buyers. ZT Systems CEO Frank Zhang will join AMD, reporting to Forrest Norrod, AMD’s data center chief. The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2025, will see AMD retaining about 1,000 of ZT Systems' roughly 2,500 employees. AMD anticipates that the acquisition will positively impact its adjusted financial performance by the end of 2025.

AMZN Earnings Preview- What to watch for tonight.csv,"Earnings from Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. will be crucial in guiding the Nasdaq 100 after a volatile period marked by extreme fluctuations. As the last megacaps to release results before Nvidia Corp. in August, these reports will set the tone for tech investors, particularly focusing on how artificial intelligence is driving growth in Amazon’s cloud-computing unit and boosting demand for Apple's next iPhone. The results will also provide valuable insights into the health of consumer spending, with Amazon shares already up about 25% this year. Amazon.com Inc. is set to release its Q2 earnings report after the market closes, with a conference call scheduled for 5:30 p.m. ET. Analysts project the company will report revenue of $148.8 billion, marking an 11% increase year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up from 65 cents in the same period last year. Amazon has guided for Q2 operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, signaling strong performance despite broader economic challenges. Key metrics expected by analysts include AWS revenue at nearly $26 billion, representing more than 17% year-over-year growth, and advertising revenue projected to reach $13 billion, a 21.7% increase from last year. The Stores segment, bolstered by events like Prime Day, is anticipated to show significant activity, while improvements in operating margins, especially in the North America segment, will be closely watched. Analysts also expect updates on AI initiatives and the overall capital expenditures for the year. Comments from analysts emphasize the importance of AI and cloud services for Amazon's future growth. Citi analysts, led by Ronald Josey, anticipate AWS revenue growth accelerated in Q2 due to generative AI tailwinds, while also predicting a beat in operating income thanks to improved retail efficiencies and strong advertising demand. Truist analyst Youssef Squali highlights Amazon's ability to gain share in global e-commerce and sees multiple growth vectors powering the company's continued expansion. Retail performance and consumer spending trends will be significant indicators, especially given mixed reports this earnings season. Analysts like Matt Stucky of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management note the importance of Amazon's retail margin expansion and its impact on profitability. Additionally, the potential for a surprise dividend announcement is a point of interest, as Amazon remains the last major tech company without a dividend program. Amazon's Q2 results will follow earnings reports from key competitors like Microsoft and Google, both of which had mixed receptions based on their cloud and AI performances. Wall Street's current focus is on tangible returns from AI investments, making Amazon's updates on its AI initiatives and AWS growth crucial for investor sentiment. The company's dominant position in the cloud market and ongoing efforts to enhance its e-commerce offerings will be under the microscope. Amazon saw its stock rise following a strong Q1 earnings report, showcasing impressive upside in both EPS and revenue. The standout metric was a significant 221% year-over-year increase in operating income to $15.31 billion, far surpassing the prior guidance of $8-12 billion. The company’s guidance for Q2 operating income of $10-14 billion also exceeded expectations. The Stores segment performed well, driven by successful shopping events like Amazon's Spring Deal Days in Europe and the first Big Spring Sale in Canada and the US. Faster delivery times, enhanced by regionalization efforts and cost-saving measures such as consolidating units into fewer boxes, boosted customer purchase frequency and overall spend. Additionally, Amazon is preparing for its 10th Prime Day event in July, which is expected to further drive sales. Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the highlight of the quarter, with a 17% growth in constant currency, an improvement from previous quarters. AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue business, with significant growth in both generative and non-generative AI workloads. The Advertising Services segment also showed robust growth, with a 24% increase in revenue to $11.82 billion, driven primarily by sponsored ads and early gains in Prime Video ads. Despite guiding Q2 revenue below consensus due to foreign exchange impacts, the strong performance in AWS and advertising has left investors optimistic.",0.5699,POSITIVE,0.9923

Some of it just recovered from 2022 to it's pre-2022 state, but Nvidia has 205% growth this year, which is crazy Index funds - the legendary S&P 500. Everyone says it's the most stable etc - but I've found other indexes with even better growth. SP500 usually have the 7-10% yearly return and last 5 years went up 56%, but for example the INDEX Vanguard Growth ETF went up 87% for the last 5 years - and it was also a steady growth, not a lucky spike during one period. What do you think, is it really smart to go with SP500 or are there other ones that are much better, even tho SP500 is so hyped by everyone? and if you agree - what other indexes with better return would you recommend? Leverage - I'm not familiar with how much can you leverage in stocks, but for people that invest in the top 10, which most likely will go up in the future, wouldn't be smarter to invest it with i.e 5x leverage, since the companies like Microsoft are stable, and eventually will grow? Stock Math - let's say I invest $10.000 in a stock and it declines -50%. I know have $5.000. If it goes up by 50%, do I get $7.500 or do I get my $10.000 back?

Goal is to take diversified risk with a sprinkle of long term securities. Plan to withdraw some XEQT as funds are used for family vacations, rather keep them in that than an idle savings account. For other stocks, hoping they rocket over the next few years, and that looming monstrosity of WW3 doesn't kill this investment. Threw some dollars in SERV at a peak, holding to not realize that cost, but would rather have it in NVDA or WULF or something else. New to this stuff and posting on Reddit, so constructive advice welcome! Too broke to post on wallstreetbets just yet but still a regard! :)",0.5225,NEGATIVE,0.9009
Fundamentals behind a USA market drop this week & some positives.csv,"The problem areas in the USA: -------------------------- *- The Schiller PE is at a very high level. Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble. So stocks are highly expensive. *- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022! We are more of a service economy than a goods economy, *- World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle. That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local sales declines are offset. Additionally the trade war hampers both sides. *- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels. *- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers. You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term. People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank. However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials. AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth. AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales. So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia. This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW. I don't own any MKSI. This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording. So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN. Good areas: -------------------------------------- *- Labor productivity is up consistently since Q3 2022. one can see tradingeconomics dot com USA productivity *- Gasoline is lower than last year *- Retail sales are going fine, [ per a recent NPR radio article ] Nuetral ---------------------------------------- *- Labor force participation is not higher than Sept 2023. No more sales growth from people returning to work. Participation is up recently. tradingeconomics has this info. *- Consumer confidence is still down since January 2020. My one man's take ---------------- The problem areas are serious. There is enough weight in the bear issues to cause the stock market to give up most of its gains this year.",0.5628,NEGATIVE,0.9999

These seven stocks, which include tech giants like Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft, have driven much of the market’s gains, with Apple rising 8%, Nvidia up 9%, and Microsoft increasing by 4% last week alone.

This divergence indicates that while the index appears strong, the underlying market health is weaker. Liz Ann Sonders, Chief Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab, pointed out that beneath the surface, the average stock in the Nasdaq has experienced a 37% drawdown, compared to the 7% maximum drawdown of the index from its year-to-date high. This suggests significant churn and rotation not visible when solely looking at index level changes. Further, the share of S&P 500 members trading above their 50-day moving average has dropped below 50%, while the index itself continues to trade above its intermediate-term average by more than 4%.

"Impacting NVDA is underlying logic,what does OpenAI is change in strategy mean.csv","Big model pre-training bottleneck: Silicon Valley AI labs are generally struggling with new model training, with OpenAI's Orion and Google's Gemini 2.0 failing to significantly outperform their predecessors, defying the “law of scaling”. This law used to mean that model performance would continue to increase with data and computation, but the scaling effect has now plateaued. Computing in the reasoning phase: To overcome pre-training bottlenecks, OpenAI and other labs are exploring “compute on test” techniques that enable human-like multi-step reasoning by allowing models to generate and evaluate multiple possibilities in real-time during the reasoning phase. This approach can be used more effectively for complex tasks such as mathematics and coding to optimize reasoning performance. Hardware Demand Shift: Market demand is likely to shift from large-scale pre-training clusters to inference clouds as new technologies reduce parameter requirements. This will weaken NVIDIA's monopoly in the training chip market, and the inference chip market may see more competition, especially as companies such as Groq may fill the new demand. Capital Trends: Venture capital organizations are highly concerned about this change, and are gradually investing more resources in distributed inference clouds to cater to the distributed server needs of inference computing.",0.5346,POSITIVE,0.6048

Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,NEGATIVE,0.9443

Hi! I’m Dan Howley, the tech editor at Yahoo Finance, and Nvidia has seemingly been at the forefront of virtually everything I’ve covered since ChatGPT hit the scene in 2022. I’ve been covering the tech space for 13 years and tracking Nvidia for even longer. I built my first desktop PC with an Nvidia graphics card in high school and have continued using its products ever since. Now I, like everyone else, am focused on Nvidia’s AI efforts, from reporting on how they’re dealing with the threat of increased competition to attending the company’s GTC conference to chatting with CEO Jensen Huang alongside my colleague Julie Hyman. With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia’s chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like AMD are gaining steam, and Nvidia’s own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant. How that plays out over the next few years is anyone’s guess. In today’s fiscal 2025 third quarter earnings report, Nvidia beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines on the strength of sales of its high-powered AI chips. 💵 Revenue: $35.08B vs $33.2B expected 💲 Adjusted EPS: $0.81 vs $0.74 expected 💾 Data center revenue: $30.8B vs $29B expected Nvidia also said it anticipates revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, for the fiscal fourth quarter. That's just ahead of Wall Street expectations of $37 billion. I’ll be back tomorrow, Nov. 21, at 10 a.m. ET to answer your questions about Nvidia’s latest earnings, the market reaction, and where the stock goes from here. That does it for me for today.

Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&P 500 gains.csv,"= just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing = The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023 https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9 The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions. It’s an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve’s inflation battle, noted FactSet’s Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post. The 10 top performing days for the S&P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%. The S&P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday’s close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%. Through Dec. 22, the S&P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%. Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said. That didn’t mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote. Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found. Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July. The strategy “indicates the Fed’s measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,” Jakobsen said. The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks’ bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group’s announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering. SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a “mini” banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown. Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks — Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78% , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, 0.16%, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%, Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%, Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%, and Meta Platforms Inc. META, 0.56%. See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024? Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind. The S&P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted. In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high: The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&P 500’s weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted. Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&P 500’s overall return, he wrote, with the company’s success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.",0.5482,NEGATIVE,0.9995
Mega-caps vs small caps.csv,"The current state of the stock market exhibits a stark contrast between the performance of mega-cap and small-cap stocks, as investors grapple with mixed signals from major corporations and broader market indices.  Recent developments have highlighted this divide, with Microsoft's upcoming earnings report set to further shape the narrative. Mega-Cap Weakness and Market Impact Microsoft, a key player in the technology sector, is set to report its earnings after the market close, and its performance could significantly influence investor sentiment.  The recent underperformance of large-cap stocks like Merck and Procter & Gamble, both of which have disappointed with earnings guidance, has contributed to the Nasdaq Composite's (-0.9%) and S&P 500's (-0.4%) downward pressure.  This weakness is reflected in the Vanguard Mega-Cap Growth ETF (MGK), which is down 1.1%. Small-Cap Resilience In contrast, small-cap stocks have shown relative strength, with the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 Value Index posting gains.  The equal-weighted S&P 500 is also holding its own, indicating that smaller companies are providing a stabilizing force in the market.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, buoyed by the financials and energy sectors, adds to this resilience. Sectors in Focus The IT sector, weighed down by NVIDIA's (-5.0%) decline ahead of AMD's earnings release, is leading the pack of losers.  Consumer staples, also negatively impacted, are lagging behind. On the other hand, financials, and energy sectors are posting gains, offering a glimmer of hope for investors seeking opportunities. Treasuries and Market Sentiment The Treasury market remains relatively calm, with the 2-yr note yield down to 4.38% and the 10-yr note yield at 4.17%.  Economic indicators, such as the better-than-expected consumer confidence index and the Bank of Japan's policy decision, have not sparked significant market movements, suggesting that investors are cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's FOMC decision on Wednesday. As we await Microsoft's earnings report, the stock market's divide between mega-cap and small-cap stocks is a cause for concern, especially for those relying on large-cap performance.  However, the resilience of small-cap companies and select sectors is providing a silver lining. Investors should stay vigilant, monitor market reactions to key earnings releases, and consider a diversified portfolio that takes into account the current market dynamics.  The Federal Reserve's decision will likely play a crucial role in determining the market's next course of action.",0.5419,NEGATIVE,0.9136

MSFT faces long-term potential disadvantages.csv,"I think one of the main reasons Microsoft is a great long-term investment is its long history of generating a lot of free cash flow. At the time of writing, the company's free cash flow margin is over 30%, with free cash flow rising from $15.9 billion in 2009 to $74.1 billion in the last 12 months. This financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments. While Microsoft may not seem like a value investment, in my opinion, its pricing is reasonable given its continued revenue and earnings growth, and it's likely to continue for the foreseeable future. I estimate EPS growth of 13% on a regular basis over the next 12 months. Based on this projection, I have a price target of $482.40 and estimate that the stock will trade at a non-GAAP P/E ratio of around 36. Looking ahead, I expect Microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15% over the next 5 to 10 years. While this prospect necessitates buying the stock at a fair valuation, I believe the current price provides an opportunity. The company's forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is only 6.5% above its five-year average, while its forward diluted earnings per share growth rate is nearly the same at 5.8%. MSFT faces long-term potential headwinds One potential challenge to Microsoft's long-term growth in AI is that its adoption can be cyclical. Currently, the demand for AI systems is high, which has prompted Microsoft and other big tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion. However, when the current trend peaks (likely due to macroeconomic constraints), growth may slow. According to the TipRanks risk analysis tool, Microsoft is exposed to 32% risk from legal and regulatory factors, which is higher than the industry average and could impact its AI operations due to increased scrutiny of data privacy and AI governance. Given this outlook, I expect some volatility in Microsoft's long-term growth trajectory, although it may not be as good as NVIDIA NVDA -0.06% ▼ and so on semiconductor companies so obvious. As market sentiment fluctuates, cyclical price and valuation declines coincide with temporarily lower growth rates and may provide more attractive buying opportunities. There is also a risk that Microsoft and other Big Tech players could over-invest in AI infrastructure. With 21% of its risk related to Tech & Innovation, Microsoft’s heavy investment in AI-driven initiatives, including data center infrastructure, could result in lower-than-expected returns if industry growth does not meet expectations. This may impact free cash flow margins in the medium term, contributing to further volatility.",0.5607,NEGATIVE,0.8794

The demand for its AI GPUs remains high, the company has been receiving upward revisions recently, and its stock is trading around its all-time high levels with a potential to appreciate even further in the upcoming months.

Revenue estimates are between 150 and 200 billion this year. I dont see how that can grow much more without Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon crushing their own profit. Capex goes right to the bottom line, so wouldn't those stocks go down if capex spending was greater than profit? Then drag whole market lower? Am I over thinking?

Nvidia announces 50 billion stock buyback.csv,"Nvidia said Wednesday that its board of directors has approved a $50 billion stock buyback. The computer chip giant announced the share repurchase as part of its fiscal second-quarter earnings, in which it reported earnings and guidance that surpassed Wall Street expectations. Nvidia returned $15.4 billion to shareholders in share repurposes and cash dividends as part of the company’s first half of its fiscal 2025. The company said it had $7.5 billion remaining under its share repurchase plan, as of the end of its fiscal second quarter. Last year, Nvidia announced a $25 billion share buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results. Companies often experience a boom to their stock price after revealing stock buyback plans. In May, for instance, Apple announced a $110 billion stock buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results that showed overall sales fell 4% year over year and iPhone sales dropped 10% year over year. However, the iPhone maker’s shares rose 7% in after-hours trading, likely because Apple’s share buyback was the biggest in corporate history. With Nvidia’s shares dropping 4% in extended trading despite reporting solid financial results and announcing a stock buyback, some experts believe the company has been doing so well that it is getting harder to impress investors. Second-quarter sales rose 122% year over year to $30.04 billion, while net income jumped 168% year over year to $16.6 billion, Nvidia said.",0.6368,NEGATIVE,0.9997

They also have exposure to the underlying commodities that are in the chips, following the ""Energy Transition"" growth theme we've seen companies move to over the past couple of years. NVIDIA's earnings today are going to be important to the market, I think a lot of people will decide to buy in and believe the macro cycle for AI will continue if they beat earnings. If not there will probably be a pullback on the tech side but I think NVIDIA will beat, based on their rapid buildout of infrastructure so far. Ex.

Nvidia More Room to Run Just Getting Started.csv,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they’ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don’t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical. Yes, Nvidia’s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn’t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now. Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn’t possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia’s place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn’t happened and Nvidia’s only gotten stronger. That’s not to say over time Nvidia won’t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it’s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution. Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations. I don’t think AI is a bubble but I do think that Nvidia and the market as a whole can get ahead of themselves. Overall, this is likely just the initial first stage - not the end - of Nvidia’s growth story.",0.5568,POSITIVE,0.6477

"Nvidia reports earnings, Fed gathers in Jackson Hole What about this week.csv","In the final week of August, investors will be focused on two major events: Nvidia's earnings and the Federal Reserve's annual meeting in Jackson Hole. The Jackson Hole Economic Symposium will kick off on Thursday, with Fed Chair Jay Powell's address serving as the major event. Powell's comments on interest rates, the economy, and any indication that inflationary pressures are driving a reassessment of the Fed's present aims will be scrutinized. On the corporate front, Nvidia headlines the earnings story this week, with the chipmaker scheduled to publish data from a quarter that caused the chipmaker to increase its revenue forecast by 50%. Lowe's, BJ's Wholesale Club, and Peloton are also set to announce earnings this week. August is shaping up to be the worst month for stocks this year, with all three main averages closing last week lower after a hawkish read of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting sent equities lower and Treasury rates higher in the second half of the week. Economic data continues to come in stronger than expected, with the July retail sales report indicating a 0.7% increase in sales for the month, about double what economists forecast. The AtlantaFed's GDPNow projection now predicts third-quarter GDP growth of 5.8%, the strongest rate since the fourth quarter of 2021. Inflation has declined dramatically since Powell's Jackson Hole speech last year, when he predicted rates will climb until the ""job is done,"" lowering inflation. Powell has stated as recently as July that inflation is ""well above"" the Fed's long-run objective of 2%. On the corporate front, all eyes will be on Nvidia, which predicted that artificial intelligence demand will increase its current quarter sales projection from $7 billion to $11 billion. Nvidia stock is up about 200% year to date, but its gains have slowed along with the market since mid-July. Nvidia's earnings release in late May signaled a shift in overall market mood for the year, with Wall Street strategists becoming more overtly bullish on stock market performance in 2023.",0.5659,NEGATIVE,0.9998

Looking further ahead, Oracle projects over $104 billion in revenue by fiscal 2029, along with a 20% year-over-year growth in earnings per share. Speaking at the Oracle CloudWorld event in Las Vegas, CEO Safra Catz expressed confidence in achieving these ambitious targets, pointing to new partnerships that allow Oracle’s database software to be offered through major cloud providers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Oracle’s strong performance continued this week as its stock gained roughly 15% over the past three trading days, setting a new record and marking a 55% increase for the year—second only to Nvidia among large-cap tech companies. Oracle’s cloud infrastructure revenue jumped 45% last quarter, outpacing its competitors and benefiting from businesses transitioning their workloads to the cloud.

Qualcomm Approached Intel About a Takeover in Recent Days.csv,"Qualcomm recently approached Intel with a takeover proposal, marking what could be one of the largest tech deals in recent memory, according to sources. Intel, once valued at over $290 billion, has seen its market cap fall to around $90 billion after a challenging year in which its shares dropped 60%. While a deal is far from guaranteed, Qualcomm’s interest comes as Intel struggles to recover under CEO Pat Gelsinger’s turnaround plan, which has yet to deliver significant results. Should Intel be receptive, the deal could face heavy antitrust scrutiny, though some argue it might bolster U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor industry. Qualcomm may consider offloading parts of Intel to complete the acquisition. Both companies have sought to capitalize on the AI boom, though they’ve lagged behind Nvidia. Intel, grappling with factory delays and cost-cutting measures, is receiving government subsidies as part of its efforts to build chip factories. A Qualcomm takeover could enhance its portfolio by adding Intel’s dominance in PCs and servers to its smartphone chip business. Despite this potential merger, Intel continues to face major hurdles, including the possible need to split its design and manufacturing operations amid growing calls for the company to separate its business divisions.

Serious question from someone who took a four-year trading break.csv,Hey everyone After a long long hiatus and licking my wounds I decided to try trading once again. Recently I've been changing up my approach and doing 5-7 DTE spy options. And it's been going pretty decent however recently I got a couple of August 30th calls for Nvidia I managed to get in at a good position for 133 calls. My thesis is that it's going to keep pumping up to the day of earnings. I don't have any intention of holding the position up until expiration. My question is regarding theta decay and volatility. I know that the closer I got to the expiration the less profit I'll see as a percentage of my position. And I also understand that during high levels of volatility it can go both ways. And I'm not really asking for specific advice just kind of guidance or knowledge as to how that may affect my position. I'm holding them over the weekend and I'm expecting Monday to start off a little red but to finish off green and so I'm not quite sure if I want to sell half my positions and wait till earnings or if I should wait to earnings in general. I strongly believe that Nvidia is going to beat their earnings I just don't know how drastically that's going to affect the price action.

Strategies to exploit uneducated investors.csv,"I feel that today's markets are saturated with retail investors that take too much risk with uneducated positions. I'm starting to explore strategies to actively take advantage of investors that do not even look at financial statements or are sensitive too hypes (e.g., three years ago everyone bought clean energy stocks, while today every John Doe wants a slice of Nvidia regardless of its valuation).

Super Micro Falls as Hindenburg Takes Aim With Short Report.csv,"Super Micro Computer Inc.'s shares took a hit on Tuesday following a short report from Hindenburg Research that questioned the company's financial practices and transparency. Hindenburg's report alleged significant accounting red flags, undisclosed related-party transactions, and potential violations of sanctions and export controls. Initially, the report caused Super Micro's stock to plummet by as much as 8.7%, but it later rebounded to close down 2.6%. The server manufacturer has been a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, with its high-performance servers in high demand for data centers. This surge in AI-related demand has driven significant growth for the company, doubling its revenue to $14.9 billion in the most recent fiscal year. Despite a steep decline from its March peak, Super Micro's stock remains up over 90% for the year, reflecting continued investor interest in the burgeoning AI sector. However, the Hindenburg report could intensify scrutiny on Super Micro's accounting practices and client relationships, particularly as the company has faced regulatory challenges in the past. In 2020, Super Micro resolved a U.S. SEC investigation by correcting its financial statements and paying a penalty for accounting issues from 2014 to 2017. As the AI market continues to expand, maintaining investor confidence will be crucial for Super Micro, especially amid concerns about the profitability of AI-optimized servers and the potential for increased regulatory oversight.

Technical Analysis Lesson - Reversal Day in Nvidia (NVDA).csv,"Every trader wants to know when the trend is changing from up to down or down to up. This happens when the leadership in the market changes from bulls to bears or bears to bulls. These trend changes are what every trader looks for. If they can accurately predict market turns, they can profit. That’s why they do what they do. Sometimes this change of leadership is slow and takes a long period of time to happen. These changes have price action that tends to show up on a chart as a ‘Rounded Top’ or ‘Rounded Bottom’ pattern. Sometimes the reversal is abrupt and takes place over a few time periods. This action tends to show up on a chart as a ‘V’ or ‘Inverted V’ reversal. But sometimes the trend changes just in one day... These dynamics can show up on a chart as a ‘Reversal Day’ pattern. One may have just happened in the stock of Nivida (NVDA). The Western world would call it an ‘Outside Reversal Day’. In candlestick terminology, it is called a ‘Bearish Engulfing Pattern’. It’s important to note that these candlestick patterns are at least 700 years old. They were developed by Japanese rice traders. It shows that the human nature which is illustrated in charts hasn’t changed. The name doesn’t matter. The action that it illustrates does. On Friday morning, it looked as though the uptrend in NVDA was going to continue for yet another day. It opened at a higher price than Thursday’s close. But then the tide turned… Over the day, the sellers came out of the woodwork. And not only did they hold off the assault. They overpowered the buyers and eventually pushed the price much lower. Importantly, Friday’s closing price was lower than Thursday’s opening price. This is frequently a characteristic of a trend that is reversing. Sometimes the change of leadership from bulls to bears happens over an extended time-period. But sometimes it occurs in just one day. That could be the case here.",0.5201,NEGATIVE,0.9938

Yes, China is a threat, but something tells me that China would not dare suffer the economic sanctions western nations would impose if they made a move in Taiwan.

TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand.csv,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

Understand this about INTC.csv,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,NEGATIVE,0.9999

When you are young, let's say early 20s, this is the time to take risks isn't it? Every right risk you take now, compounds like crazy, every mistake? You are young you can still recover and learn. I'm not saying dump 100% like wallstreetbets gambling, but I'm talking about investing in stuff you believe in, despite the temporary bad financials or pr or being undervalued? For example, I am a software/hardware engineering student, and I was a gamer as a child. I knew a lot about companies like Intel, AMD, Nvidia etc. In college I knew Nvdia was gonna blow up because of CUDA and what not, AMD would blow intel out of the way, QCOM I was a fan of because I did some research on their chips. These are very entry level knowledge, but if it's enough for me to believe in working for these companies, isn't it enough to invest let's say 10%, 20%? Instead of dumping all into HYSA T bills and VTI/VOO VXUS etc and using 5% for individual picks? If shit goes down market goes down, I saw the covid crash happen infront of my eyes, I had 10k savings from my first internship, I could have bought these shares I believed so much in, but I didn't, it stayed in a HYSA. Sure you might not pick tesla before the run or nvidia, but you can pick amzn msft goog amd and if all these become bad picks and fail me then I don't think I should work for the tech industry right?

Why am I bullish on SFY instead of SPY.csv,"A comparison analysis between the holdings of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY), I have compiled information from the most recent available data. Below is a table showing the top 10 holdings for each ETF along with their percentage weight in the respective ETFs. This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings: Data Sources: SPY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Schwab, Yahoo Finance. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST) SFY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Zacks.com, Yahoo Finance. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST) Key Observations: Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting. It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation. I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors: Expense Ratio: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. Stock Selection Methodology: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. Performance Trends: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. Portfolio Diversification: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. Market Positioning: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. Innovative Approach of SoFi: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy. It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.

"Why Are Analysts Increasing NVIDIA’s Price Target Is It Out of Fear That Something Bad Will Happen, .csv","NVIDIA, often considered the heart of AI stocks, has recently been in the spotlight as analysts uniformly raise their stock targets. To me, this trend seems somewhat peculiar, even considering the current earnings season. The buoyant optimism surrounding the stock’s potential rise is sparking doubt in my mind. Should the stock underperform, it will be a litmus test of these analysts’ sincerity, raising questions about whether they may be manipulating public sentiment. In the broader context of the semiconductor sector, the recent quarterly earnings have been largely underwhelming. Yet, all semiconductor stocks appear to be buoyed by NVIDIA’s momentum. A stumble in NVIDIA’s stock could trigger a broader tech market downfall, while success could reignite a bullish trend for tech stocks.

I believe that other companies will eventually have to invest in their products and services, maybe not now, but certainly in the future and this isn’t including their military side. I’m iffy on holding NVIDIA because of how much hype it’s gotten this year but it’s hard to gage how much demand is needed , i have no problem holding for the next year but after that I might sell. I’ve added 6 more shares of CRWD because I genuinely think that bigger companies in this day and age cannot operate without Cybersecurity. The last company i worked at (Cigna) uses Crowd-strikes malware scan and in the midst of CRWDs downturn with delta etc i had a good feeling that it would recover. AMZ remains my biggest holding and i think it’s still so undervalued. I’d like to hear your guys perspectives on the balance of my portfolio. In the coming months i want to invest $100-200 a month into VOO, BRK and SCHD but i want to hear opinions because my goal is growth and i have a long horizon and don’t plan on selling.",0.5385,NEGATIVE,0.9886

"AI Spending Isn’t Slowing Down, the Mag 7 Stocks Are Still the Best Bet.csv","Microsoft and Google's parent company, Alphabet, aren't going to stop pouring billions into chatbots. Although Nvidia saw a dip due to high market expectations, the long-term outlook for AI remains strong, with chip sales still showing impressive growth. While there’s competition from AMD, the overall demand for AI chips is skyrocketing. The Mag 7 remains the key growth driver for AI. Analysts predict these companies will keep growing, with capital spending expected to surge by double digits, reaching nearly $300 billion by 2027 (according to FactSet). Nvidia benefits from chip demand, while Meta drives revenue through advertising. And even though the Mag 7 has outperformed the market (twice the S&P 500's gains), their valuations are still reasonable—around 27 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, down from over 30 times earlier this year, and near the middle of their historical range (according to Evercore).

Quarterly Highlights: • Earnings per share: 69 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected • Revenue: $5.83 billion vs. $5.72 billion expected • Expected Q3 Sales: $6.7 billion vs. $6.61 billion expected Financial Performance: • Net Income: $265 million (16 cents per share) vs. $27 million (2 cents per share) YoY • Data Center Revenue: Grew 115% YoY to $2.8 billion, driven by AI chip sales (Instinct GPUs) • Client Segment (PCs): Rose 49% YoY to $1.5 billion, indicating a recovering PC market • Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% YoY, below the expected $676 million • Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% YoY, slightly above the expected $856 million AMD’s AI chip sales, reported under the Data Center segment, saw significant growth, highlighting the company’s efforts to compete with Nvidia. AMD’s MI300X AI chip aims to capture market share from Nvidia, which has seen its stock double this year due to high demand for AI GPUs. Despite a challenging year with shares down 6% in 2024, AMD remains the second-largest vendor of data center GPUs, trailing Nvidia. Investors are focused on AMD’s ability to grow its AI business, with the company anticipating $4 billion in AI chip sales this year, accounting for 15% of its total expected sales. AMD’s core business in CPUs for laptops and servers and its growing AI chip segment position the company as a significant player in the evolving technology landscape.

AMD to acquire server builder ZT Systems for 49 billion in cash and stock.csv,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced on Monday its plans to acquire server manufacturer ZT Systems for $4.9 billion, as part of its strategy to bolster its portfolio of artificial intelligence (AI) chips and hardware, and to compete more effectively against Nvidia. The acquisition will be financed with 75% cash and the remaining in stock, leveraging AMD’s $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments reported in the second quarter. The rising demands of AI computing have necessitated the use of thousands of interconnected chips to achieve the required processing power, making the design and construction of server systems increasingly critical. This acquisition will enable AMD to enhance its capabilities in this area. According to AMD CEO Lisa Su, the addition of ZT Systems’ engineers will accelerate the company’s ability to test and deploy its latest AI GPUs on a scale required by major cloud computing companies like Microsoft. Although AMD plans to incorporate ZT Systems into its operations, it has no intention of competing directly in the server manufacturing market. Instead, the company plans to divest its server manufacturing business after the acquisition is finalized, with no discussions yet held with potential buyers. ZT Systems CEO Frank Zhang will join AMD, reporting to Forrest Norrod, AMD’s data center chief. The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2025, will see AMD retaining about 1,000 of ZT Systems' roughly 2,500 employees. AMD anticipates that the acquisition will positively impact its adjusted financial performance by the end of 2025.

AMZN Earnings Preview- What to watch for tonight.csv,"Earnings from Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. will be crucial in guiding the Nasdaq 100 after a volatile period marked by extreme fluctuations. As the last megacaps to release results before Nvidia Corp. in August, these reports will set the tone for tech investors, particularly focusing on how artificial intelligence is driving growth in Amazon’s cloud-computing unit and boosting demand for Apple's next iPhone. The results will also provide valuable insights into the health of consumer spending, with Amazon shares already up about 25% this year. Amazon.com Inc. is set to release its Q2 earnings report after the market closes, with a conference call scheduled for 5:30 p.m. ET. Analysts project the company will report revenue of $148.8 billion, marking an 11% increase year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up from 65 cents in the same period last year. Amazon has guided for Q2 operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, signaling strong performance despite broader economic challenges. Key metrics expected by analysts include AWS revenue at nearly $26 billion, representing more than 17% year-over-year growth, and advertising revenue projected to reach $13 billion, a 21.7% increase from last year. The Stores segment, bolstered by events like Prime Day, is anticipated to show significant activity, while improvements in operating margins, especially in the North America segment, will be closely watched. Analysts also expect updates on AI initiatives and the overall capital expenditures for the year. Comments from analysts emphasize the importance of AI and cloud services for Amazon's future growth. Citi analysts, led by Ronald Josey, anticipate AWS revenue growth accelerated in Q2 due to generative AI tailwinds, while also predicting a beat in operating income thanks to improved retail efficiencies and strong advertising demand. Truist analyst Youssef Squali highlights Amazon's ability to gain share in global e-commerce and sees multiple growth vectors powering the company's continued expansion. Retail performance and consumer spending trends will be significant indicators, especially given mixed reports this earnings season. Analysts like Matt Stucky of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management note the importance of Amazon's retail margin expansion and its impact on profitability. Additionally, the potential for a surprise dividend announcement is a point of interest, as Amazon remains the last major tech company without a dividend program. Amazon's Q2 results will follow earnings reports from key competitors like Microsoft and Google, both of which had mixed receptions based on their cloud and AI performances. Wall Street's current focus is on tangible returns from AI investments, making Amazon's updates on its AI initiatives and AWS growth crucial for investor sentiment. The company's dominant position in the cloud market and ongoing efforts to enhance its e-commerce offerings will be under the microscope. Amazon saw its stock rise following a strong Q1 earnings report, showcasing impressive upside in both EPS and revenue. The standout metric was a significant 221% year-over-year increase in operating income to $15.31 billion, far surpassing the prior guidance of $8-12 billion. The company’s guidance for Q2 operating income of $10-14 billion also exceeded expectations. The Stores segment performed well, driven by successful shopping events like Amazon's Spring Deal Days in Europe and the first Big Spring Sale in Canada and the US. Faster delivery times, enhanced by regionalization efforts and cost-saving measures such as consolidating units into fewer boxes, boosted customer purchase frequency and overall spend. Additionally, Amazon is preparing for its 10th Prime Day event in July, which is expected to further drive sales. Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the highlight of the quarter, with a 17% growth in constant currency, an improvement from previous quarters. AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue business, with significant growth in both generative and non-generative AI workloads. The Advertising Services segment also showed robust growth, with a 24% increase in revenue to $11.82 billion, driven primarily by sponsored ads and early gains in Prime Video ads. Despite guiding Q2 revenue below consensus due to foreign exchange impacts, the strong performance in AWS and advertising has left investors optimistic.",0.5699,POSITIVE,0.9923

I'm wondering whether I should wait for it to drop, because most of the stock market is green this year, so I have a feeling it may drop since it grew so much, what do you think? Some of it just recovered from 2022 to it's pre-2022 state, but Nvidia has 205% growth this year, which is crazy Index funds - the legendary S&P 500. Everyone says it's the most stable etc - but I've found other indexes with even better growth. SP500 usually have the 7-10% yearly return and last 5 years went up 56%, but for example the INDEX Vanguard Growth ETF went up 87% for the last 5 years - and it was also a steady growth, not a lucky spike during one period. What do you think, is it really smart to go with SP500 or are there other ones that are much better, even tho SP500 is so hyped by everyone? and if you agree - what other indexes with better return would you recommend? Leverage - I'm not familiar with how much can you leverage in stocks, but for people that invest in the top 10, which most likely will go up in the future, wouldn't be smarter to invest it with i.e 5x leverage, since the companies like Microsoft are stable, and eventually will grow? Stock Math - let's say I invest $10.000 in a stock and it declines -50%. I know have $5.000. If it goes up by 50%, do I get $7.500 or do I get my $10.000 back? Logically the first answer, but something doesn't give me a peace of mind here, so I prefer to ask Eli Lilly - what do you think about this stock? Growed massive amount lately, and pharmaceutical industry will definitely be there in 5 or 10 years.",0.5565,NEGATIVE,0.9857

Fundamentals behind a USA market drop this week & some positives.csv,"The problem areas in the USA: -------------------------- *- The Schiller PE is at a very high level. Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble. So stocks are highly expensive. *- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022! We are more of a service economy than a goods economy, *- World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle. That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local sales declines are offset. Additionally the trade war hampers both sides. *- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels. *- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers. You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term. People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank. However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials. AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth. AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales. So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia. This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW. I don't own any MKSI. This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording. So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN.

"Impacting NVDA is underlying logic,what does OpenAI is change in strategy mean.csv","Big model pre-training bottleneck: Silicon Valley AI labs are generally struggling with new model training, with OpenAI's Orion and Google's Gemini 2.0 failing to significantly outperform their predecessors, defying the “law of scaling”. This law used to mean that model performance would continue to increase with data and computation, but the scaling effect has now plateaued. Computing in the reasoning phase: To overcome pre-training bottlenecks, OpenAI and other labs are exploring “compute on test” techniques that enable human-like multi-step reasoning by allowing models to generate and evaluate multiple possibilities in real-time during the reasoning phase. This approach can be used more effectively for complex tasks such as mathematics and coding to optimize reasoning performance. Hardware Demand Shift: Market demand is likely to shift from large-scale pre-training clusters to inference clouds as new technologies reduce parameter requirements. This will weaken NVIDIA's monopoly in the training chip market, and the inference chip market may see more competition, especially as companies such as Groq may fill the new demand. Capital Trends: Venture capital organizations are highly concerned about this change, and are gradually investing more resources in distributed inference clouds to cater to the distributed server needs of inference computing.",0.5346,POSITIVE,0.6048

Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,NEGATIVE,0.9443

Hi! I’m Dan Howley, the tech editor at Yahoo Finance, and Nvidia has seemingly been at the forefront of virtually everything I’ve covered since ChatGPT hit the scene in 2022. I’ve been covering the tech space for 13 years and tracking Nvidia for even longer. I built my first desktop PC with an Nvidia graphics card in high school and have continued using its products ever since. Now I, like everyone else, am focused on Nvidia’s AI efforts, from reporting on how they’re dealing with the threat of increased competition to attending the company’s GTC conference to chatting with CEO Jensen Huang alongside my colleague Julie Hyman. With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia’s chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like AMD are gaining steam, and Nvidia’s own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant. How that plays out over the next few years is anyone’s guess.

Last week's high volume stocks.csv,"TSLA - Tesla saw massive move to the up and it has now gone in over extended territory. Do not chase and wait for it to dip to support level at 271.28, BAC - Crossed over resistance of 44.26 and retested that level. It should keep going higher under lower interest rate environment. My immediate target (resistance) is at 47.24 MSFT - Good stock to go/stay longs. Unlike many other stocks that's hitting ATH, MSFT still hasn't flown away to hit the ATH. It's not the question IF, the question is WHEN. Immediate resistance is at 438/439. UPST - Upstart had great earnings and the stock went up by 24% in a day after earnings. The next immediate resistance is sitting between 86-95 META - Meta is going in a range at this point. The support is sitting at 558-569 and price coming to that area will be nicely bought. INTC - Intel had nice weekly bullish candle. There are few pivot (support) levels: 24.71, 23.56, 22.12. My immediate target is at 27.86 where it can face some resistance. AAPL - Apple has been going in a range. We need to look for a breakout/down. A close below 213 is a breakdown whereas close above 238 in daily chart will be a breakout. AMZN - Amazon had a breakout above 200. Will it retest or continue going higher? My target to above sits at 214 for now. AMD - Lot of people are looking at AMD. It had a bullish last week but I believe it still has some more room below before rallying. SOFI - Nice weekly breakout. Do not chase and wait for retest. The key level to retest is at 11/12 range. NVDA - Three weeks ago Nvidia had weekly breakout and then it retested those levels before continuation to the upside last week.

Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&P 500 gains.csv,"= just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing = The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023 https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9 The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions. It’s an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve’s inflation battle, noted FactSet’s Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post. The 10 top performing days for the S&P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%. The S&P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday’s close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%. Through Dec. 22, the S&P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%. Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said. That didn’t mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote. Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found. Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July. The strategy “indicates the Fed’s measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,” Jakobsen said. The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks’ bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group’s announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering. SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a “mini” banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown. Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks — Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78% , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, 0.16%, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%, Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%, Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%, and Meta Platforms Inc. META, 0.56%. See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024? Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind. The S&P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted. In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high: The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&P 500’s weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted. Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&P 500’s overall return, he wrote, with the company’s success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.",0.5482,NEGATIVE,0.9995
Mega-caps vs small caps.csv,"The current state of the stock market exhibits a stark contrast between the performance of mega-cap and small-cap stocks, as investors grapple with mixed signals from major corporations and broader market indices.  Recent developments have highlighted this divide, with Microsoft's upcoming earnings report set to further shape the narrative. Mega-Cap Weakness and Market Impact Microsoft, a key player in the technology sector, is set to report its earnings after the market close, and its performance could significantly influence investor sentiment.  The recent underperformance of large-cap stocks like Merck and Procter & Gamble, both of which have disappointed with earnings guidance, has contributed to the Nasdaq Composite's (-0.9%) and S&P 500's (-0.4%) downward pressure.  This weakness is reflected in the Vanguard Mega-Cap Growth ETF (MGK), which is down 1.1%. Small-Cap Resilience In contrast, small-cap stocks have shown relative strength, with the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 Value Index posting gains.  The equal-weighted S&P 500 is also holding its own, indicating that smaller companies are providing a stabilizing force in the market.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, buoyed by the financials and energy sectors, adds to this resilience. Sectors in Focus The IT sector, weighed down by NVIDIA's (-5.0%) decline ahead of AMD's earnings release, is leading the pack of losers.  Consumer staples, also negatively impacted, are lagging behind. On the other hand, financials, and energy sectors are posting gains, offering a glimmer of hope for investors seeking opportunities. Treasuries and Market Sentiment The Treasury market remains relatively calm, with the 2-yr note yield down to 4.38% and the 10-yr note yield at 4.17%.  Economic indicators, such as the better-than-expected consumer confidence index and the Bank of Japan's policy decision, have not sparked significant market movements, suggesting that investors are cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's FOMC decision on Wednesday. As we await Microsoft's earnings report, the stock market's divide between mega-cap and small-cap stocks is a cause for concern, especially for those relying on large-cap performance.  However, the resilience of small-cap companies and select sectors is providing a silver lining. Investors should stay vigilant, monitor market reactions to key earnings releases, and consider a diversified portfolio that takes into account the current market dynamics.  The Federal Reserve's decision will likely play a crucial role in determining the market's next course of action.",0.5419,NEGATIVE,0.9136

MSFT faces long-term potential disadvantages.csv,"I think one of the main reasons Microsoft is a great long-term investment is its long history of generating a lot of free cash flow. At the time of writing, the company's free cash flow margin is over 30%, with free cash flow rising from $15.9 billion in 2009 to $74.1 billion in the last 12 months. This financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments. While Microsoft may not seem like a value investment, in my opinion, its pricing is reasonable given its continued revenue and earnings growth, and it's likely to continue for the foreseeable future. I estimate EPS growth of 13% on a regular basis over the next 12 months. Based on this projection, I have a price target of $482.40 and estimate that the stock will trade at a non-GAAP P/E ratio of around 36. Looking ahead, I expect Microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15% over the next 5 to 10 years. While this prospect necessitates buying the stock at a fair valuation, I believe the current price provides an opportunity. The company's forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is only 6.5% above its five-year average, while its forward diluted earnings per share growth rate is nearly the same at 5.8%. MSFT faces long-term potential headwinds One potential challenge to Microsoft's long-term growth in AI is that its adoption can be cyclical. Currently, the demand for AI systems is high, which has prompted Microsoft and other big tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion. However, when the current trend peaks (likely due to macroeconomic constraints), growth may slow. According to the TipRanks risk analysis tool, Microsoft is exposed to 32% risk from legal and regulatory factors, which is higher than the industry average and could impact its AI operations due to increased scrutiny of data privacy and AI governance. Given this outlook, I expect some volatility in Microsoft's long-term growth trajectory, although it may not be as good as NVIDIA NVDA -0.06% ▼ and so on semiconductor companies so obvious. As market sentiment fluctuates, cyclical price and valuation declines coincide with temporarily lower growth rates and may provide more attractive buying opportunities. There is also a risk that Microsoft and other Big Tech players could over-invest in AI infrastructure. With 21% of its risk related to Tech & Innovation, Microsoft’s heavy investment in AI-driven initiatives, including data center infrastructure, could result in lower-than-expected returns if industry growth does not meet expectations. This may impact free cash flow margins in the medium term, contributing to further volatility.",0.5607,NEGATIVE,0.8794

While an earnings beat is not fully guaranteed, the latest earnings results of the company’s peers, suppliers, clients, and businesses that have a connection to the generative AI industry point to Nvidia having a stellar performance in Q3. The demand for its AI GPUs remains high, the company has been receiving upward revisions recently, and its stock is trading around its all-time high levels with a potential to appreciate even further in the upcoming months.

Nvidia announces 50 billion stock buyback.csv,"Nvidia said Wednesday that its board of directors has approved a $50 billion stock buyback. The computer chip giant announced the share repurchase as part of its fiscal second-quarter earnings, in which it reported earnings and guidance that surpassed Wall Street expectations. Nvidia returned $15.4 billion to shareholders in share repurposes and cash dividends as part of the company’s first half of its fiscal 2025. The company said it had $7.5 billion remaining under its share repurchase plan, as of the end of its fiscal second quarter. Last year, Nvidia announced a $25 billion share buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results. Companies often experience a boom to their stock price after revealing stock buyback plans. In May, for instance, Apple announced a $110 billion stock buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results that showed overall sales fell 4% year over year and iPhone sales dropped 10% year over year. However, the iPhone maker’s shares rose 7% in after-hours trading, likely because Apple’s share buyback was the biggest in corporate history. With Nvidia’s shares dropping 4% in extended trading despite reporting solid financial results and announcing a stock buyback, some experts believe the company has been doing so well that it is getting harder to impress investors.

Nvidia More Room to Run Just Getting Started.csv,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they’ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don’t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical. Yes, Nvidia’s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn’t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now. Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn’t possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia’s place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn’t happened and Nvidia’s only gotten stronger. That’s not to say over time Nvidia won’t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it’s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution. Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations.

"Nvidia reports earnings, Fed gathers in Jackson Hole What about this week.csv","In the final week of August, investors will be focused on two major events: Nvidia's earnings and the Federal Reserve's annual meeting in Jackson Hole. The Jackson Hole Economic Symposium will kick off on Thursday, with Fed Chair Jay Powell's address serving as the major event. Powell's comments on interest rates, the economy, and any indication that inflationary pressures are driving a reassessment of the Fed's present aims will be scrutinized. On the corporate front, Nvidia headlines the earnings story this week, with the chipmaker scheduled to publish data from a quarter that caused the chipmaker to increase its revenue forecast by 50%. Lowe's, BJ's Wholesale Club, and Peloton are also set to announce earnings this week. August is shaping up to be the worst month for stocks this year, with all three main averages closing last week lower after a hawkish read of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting sent equities lower and Treasury rates higher in the second half of the week. Economic data continues to come in stronger than expected, with the July retail sales report indicating a 0.7% increase in sales for the month, about double what economists forecast. The AtlantaFed's GDPNow projection now predicts third-quarter GDP growth of 5.8%, the strongest rate since the fourth quarter of 2021. Inflation has declined dramatically since Powell's Jackson Hole speech last year, when he predicted rates will climb until the ""job is done,"" lowering inflation. Powell has stated as recently as July that inflation is ""well above"" the Fed's long-run objective of 2%. On the corporate front, all eyes will be on Nvidia, which predicted that artificial intelligence demand will increase its current quarter sales projection from $7 billion to $11 billion. Nvidia stock is up about 200% year to date, but its gains have slowed along with the market since mid-July. Nvidia's earnings release in late May signaled a shift in overall market mood for the year, with Wall Street strategists becoming more overtly bullish on stock market performance in 2023.",0.5659,NEGATIVE,0.9998

Looking further ahead, Oracle projects over $104 billion in revenue by fiscal 2029, along with a 20% year-over-year growth in earnings per share. Speaking at the Oracle CloudWorld event in Las Vegas, CEO Safra Catz expressed confidence in achieving these ambitious targets, pointing to new partnerships that allow Oracle’s database software to be offered through major cloud providers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Oracle’s strong performance continued this week as its stock gained roughly 15% over the past three trading days, setting a new record and marking a 55% increase for the year—second only to Nvidia among large-cap tech companies. Oracle’s cloud infrastructure revenue jumped 45% last quarter, outpacing its competitors and benefiting from businesses transitioning their workloads to the cloud.

Qualcomm Approached Intel About a Takeover in Recent Days.csv,"Qualcomm recently approached Intel with a takeover proposal, marking what could be one of the largest tech deals in recent memory, according to sources. Intel, once valued at over $290 billion, has seen its market cap fall to around $90 billion after a challenging year in which its shares dropped 60%. While a deal is far from guaranteed, Qualcomm’s interest comes as Intel struggles to recover under CEO Pat Gelsinger’s turnaround plan, which has yet to deliver significant results. Should Intel be receptive, the deal could face heavy antitrust scrutiny, though some argue it might bolster U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor industry. Qualcomm may consider offloading parts of Intel to complete the acquisition. Both companies have sought to capitalize on the AI boom, though they’ve lagged behind Nvidia. Intel, grappling with factory delays and cost-cutting measures, is receiving government subsidies as part of its efforts to build chip factories. A Qualcomm takeover could enhance its portfolio by adding Intel’s dominance in PCs and servers to its smartphone chip business. Despite this potential merger, Intel continues to face major hurdles, including the possible need to split its design and manufacturing operations amid growing calls for the company to separate its business divisions.

Serious question from someone who took a four-year trading break.csv,Hey everyone After a long long hiatus and licking my wounds I decided to try trading once again. Recently I've been changing up my approach and doing 5-7 DTE spy options. And it's been going pretty decent however recently I got a couple of August 30th calls for Nvidia I managed to get in at a good position for 133 calls. My thesis is that it's going to keep pumping up to the day of earnings. I don't have any intention of holding the position up until expiration. My question is regarding theta decay and volatility. I know that the closer I got to the expiration the less profit I'll see as a percentage of my position. And I also understand that during high levels of volatility it can go both ways. And I'm not really asking for specific advice just kind of guidance or knowledge as to how that may affect my position. I'm holding them over the weekend and I'm expecting Monday to start off a little red but to finish off green and so I'm not quite sure if I want to sell half my positions and wait till earnings or if I should wait to earnings in general. I strongly believe that Nvidia is going to beat their earnings I just don't know how drastically that's going to affect the price action. Any and all input is definitely appreciated Thanks in advance,0.5421,NEGATIVE,0.9936

Super Micro Falls as Hindenburg Takes Aim With Short Report.csv,"Super Micro Computer Inc.'s shares took a hit on Tuesday following a short report from Hindenburg Research that questioned the company's financial practices and transparency. Hindenburg's report alleged significant accounting red flags, undisclosed related-party transactions, and potential violations of sanctions and export controls. Initially, the report caused Super Micro's stock to plummet by as much as 8.7%, but it later rebounded to close down 2.6%. The server manufacturer has been a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, with its high-performance servers in high demand for data centers. This surge in AI-related demand has driven significant growth for the company, doubling its revenue to $14.9 billion in the most recent fiscal year. Despite a steep decline from its March peak, Super Micro's stock remains up over 90% for the year, reflecting continued investor interest in the burgeoning AI sector. However, the Hindenburg report could intensify scrutiny on Super Micro's accounting practices and client relationships, particularly as the company has faced regulatory challenges in the past. In 2020, Super Micro resolved a U.S. SEC investigation by correcting its financial statements and paying a penalty for accounting issues from 2014 to 2017. As the AI market continues to expand, maintaining investor confidence will be crucial for Super Micro, especially amid concerns about the profitability of AI-optimized servers and the potential for increased regulatory oversight.

Technical Analysis Lesson - Reversal Day in Nvidia (NVDA).csv,"Every trader wants to know when the trend is changing from up to down or down to up. This happens when the leadership in the market changes from bulls to bears or bears to bulls. These trend changes are what every trader looks for. If they can accurately predict market turns, they can profit. That’s why they do what they do. Sometimes this change of leadership is slow and takes a long period of time to happen. These changes have price action that tends to show up on a chart as a ‘Rounded Top’ or ‘Rounded Bottom’ pattern. Sometimes the reversal is abrupt and takes place over a few time periods. This action tends to show up on a chart as a ‘V’ or ‘Inverted V’ reversal. But sometimes the trend changes just in one day... These dynamics can show up on a chart as a ‘Reversal Day’ pattern. One may have just happened in the stock of Nivida (NVDA). The Western world would call it an ‘Outside Reversal Day’. In candlestick terminology, it is called a ‘Bearish Engulfing Pattern’. It’s important to note that these candlestick patterns are at least 700 years old. They were developed by Japanese rice traders. It shows that the human nature which is illustrated in charts hasn’t changed. The name doesn’t matter. The action that it illustrates does. On Friday morning, it looked as though the uptrend in NVDA was going to continue for yet another day. It opened at a higher price than Thursday’s close. But then the tide turned… Over the day, the sellers came out of the woodwork. And not only did they hold off the assault. They overpowered the buyers and eventually pushed the price much lower. Importantly, Friday’s closing price was lower than Thursday’s opening price. This is frequently a characteristic of a trend that is reversing.

Yes, China is a threat, but something tells me that China would not dare suffer the economic sanctions western nations would impose if they made a move in Taiwan.

TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand.csv,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

Understand this about INTC.csv,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,NEGATIVE,0.9999

VOO and chill but can you really not make smart moves.csv,"Hello, 21 year old here I understand some things have been proven over time, like ETFs boglehead philosophy etc. time in the market over timing the market but what about words like ""be greedy when others are fearful and be fearful when others are greedy?"" When you are young, let's say early 20s, this is the time to take risks isn't it? Every right risk you take now, compounds like crazy, every mistake? You are young you can still recover and learn. I'm not saying dump 100% like wallstreetbets gambling, but I'm talking about investing in stuff you believe in, despite the temporary bad financials or pr or being undervalued? For example, I am a software/hardware engineering student, and I was a gamer as a child. I knew a lot about companies like Intel, AMD, Nvidia etc. In college I knew Nvdia was gonna blow up because of CUDA and what not, AMD would blow intel out of the way, QCOM I was a fan of because I did some research on their chips. These are very entry level knowledge, but if it's enough for me to believe in working for these companies, isn't it enough to invest let's say 10%, 20%? Instead of dumping all into HYSA T bills and VTI/VOO VXUS etc and using 5% for individual picks? If shit goes down market goes down, I saw the covid crash happen infront of my eyes, I had 10k savings from my first internship, I could have bought these shares I believed so much in, but I didn't, it stayed in a HYSA. Sure you might not pick tesla before the run or nvidia, but you can pick amzn msft goog amd and if all these become bad picks and fail me then I don't think I should work for the tech industry right? If tech fails I fail because thats what I'm going into, and if I can risk my career for a job in such a ""volatile"" market then why can't I ""risk"" 30-50% of my portfolio in the same tier companies?

We are at the declining cool down phase of Tech.csv,"We have had a crazy run since October of last year and it seems now we are cooling down for the foreseeable future in major tech stocks.

Why am I bullish on SFY instead of SPY.csv,"A comparison analysis between the holdings of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY), I have compiled information from the most recent available data. Below is a table showing the top 10 holdings for each ETF along with their percentage weight in the respective ETFs. This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings: Data Sources: SPY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Schwab, Yahoo Finance. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST) SFY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Zacks.com, Yahoo Finance. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST) Key Observations: Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting. It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation. I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors: Expense Ratio: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. Stock Selection Methodology: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. Performance Trends: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. Portfolio Diversification: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. Market Positioning: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. Innovative Approach of SoFi: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy. It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.

"Why Are Analysts Increasing NVIDIA’s Price Target Is It Out of Fear That Something Bad Will Happen, .csv","NVIDIA, often considered the heart of AI stocks, has recently been in the spotlight as analysts uniformly raise their stock targets. To me, this trend seems somewhat peculiar, even considering the current earnings season. The buoyant optimism surrounding the stock’s potential rise is sparking doubt in my mind. Should the stock underperform, it will be a litmus test of these analysts’ sincerity, raising questions about whether they may be manipulating public sentiment. In the broader context of the semiconductor sector, the recent quarterly earnings have been largely underwhelming. Yet, all semiconductor stocks appear to be buoyed by NVIDIA’s momentum. A stumble in NVIDIA’s stock could trigger a broader tech market downfall, while success could reignite a bullish trend for tech stocks. My intuition, however, leans towards a potential disappointment. NVIDIA might surpass current estimates but simultaneously lower their future guidance due to sluggish growth. Should this occur, a significant drop in stock price could follow. Disclaimer: These thoughts are purely my own observations and should not be taken as financial advice.",0.542,NEGATIVE,0.9983

It continues to grow today, and to play a high-quality video game, you would need an NVIDIA video card. Cryp* boom: This started in the early 2010s and continues to this day.

Worse case scenario the perfect Bear cocktail.csv,"After reading all the comments from my last post and doing some more thinking. I decided to entertain the idea of what would be the perfect Bear cocktail that could trigger a Stock Market destabilization. I'm not taking into account any type of positive news. I'm simply going the negative route, in a slow and systematic manner, without any huge trigger events. What am I missing and at what dates that's important and could also add to this? If you notice in the prior post list, three out of six times... rising interest rates were part of the cause that brought the market down at least 20%. Oil price shocks two out of 6. Then there´s speculative investments at the dotcom bubble. Covid, overvaluation, trade tensions... Stagflation. So these have to be in the mix one way or another: Cocktail Potential Ingredients: Rising interest rates. Oil price shocks. Speculative tech investments. Overvaluation. Trade tensions. Stagflation. New round of Covid-19. Housing or Commercial Real Estate Bubble. So this is the speculative worse case scenario we could have without going as far as having a WWIII: February 13, 2024: CPI report comes in hot. S&P500 comes down 1.5%, some buy the tiny dip. February 15, 2024: Jobless claims rise. Doesn't alter the market but adds to the cocktail mix. February 16, 2024: A higher-than-expected PPI indicates increasing costs at the producer level, which can signal rising inflationary pressures. Producers might pass these higher costs onto consumers, leading to an increase in consumer prices and overall inflation. The Fed to consider tightening monetary policy more aggressively than previously anticipated to combat inflation. This could include raising interest rates or adjusting the pace of tapering asset purchases. Financial markets don't react negatively to a higher-than-expected PPI, as it they priced it in from the CPI report. February 21, 2024: Nvidia posts earnings, they actually do fine but investors realize that´s gonna be the ceiling for now so the stock falls 15%. Other tech stocks get stained by the fear, bringing the S&P500 2.5% lower. AI investment sentiments leans towards potentially speculative for now. March 12, 2024: February´s CPI report comes in hot again, causing Algorithmic trades to sell and bring down the S&P500 another 2%. March 19-20, 2024: FOMC Meeting gives subtext of potentially not bringing interest rates down yet. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterates emphasis on the central bank's commitment to combating inflation, even if it requires keeping interest rates high for an extended period. This brings down the market sentiment down and numbers another 1%. April 5, 2024: In a CNBC YouTube video report, experts delve into the complexities of the current commercial real estate (CRE) market. The rise of remote work led to a decreased demand for office spaces, the pandemic trained people to make purchases online, commercial real estate bubble starts to show symptoms of cracking up. April 10, 2024: CPI report is on ambiguous. Not up, not down. Anything could happen at this point. Aprils report will define what the FED will do and the next 6 months of stock market activity. Market loses .5% April 17, 2024: Tom Lee's bullish perspective has been challenged by the prior events and during an interview he mentions that this was the turmoil he had been expecting but sees the S&P500 going back to 5,200 points by the end of the year. Currently at 4,600... 7.5% below all time highs. May 1, 2024: FOMC Meeting leaves a bad taste in mouth. Jerome shifts narrative towards not lowering interests rates yet. Market falls another 2.5% on the bad sentiment. May 15, 2024: Situations in the Middle East, such as tensions in Gaza or Iran, could impact global oil supplies by affecting regional stability and energy infrastructure. Saudi Arabia, a key OPEC member, might alter its oil production strategy in response to shifts in global politics, economic pressures, or changes in energy demand. Actions perceived as irrational could stem from strategic decisions to protect national interests, influence oil prices, or respond to international events. S&P500 falls 0.5%. July 8, 2024: A new wave of Covid-19 actually breaks through the collective deceit of it being over because death rates rise significantly and word spreads out again from hospital staff that's it's getting real bad. Stock market reacts in a mixed manner. Amazon and tech companies go up a little, small caps enter another bad rout. S&P500 falls 1%. July 20, 2024: Numbers start to confirm a Stagflation situation actually taking place. A significant slowdown in economic growth, rising unemployment rates, declining consumer spending, and a contraction in manufacturing. Inflation pressures, coupled with tightening monetary policies aimed at controlling price levels, contribute to decreased economic activity.

Although AMD plans to incorporate ZT Systems into its operations, it has no intention of competing directly in the server manufacturing market. Instead, the company plans to divest its server manufacturing business after the acquisition is finalized, with no discussions yet held with potential buyers. ZT Systems CEO Frank Zhang will join AMD, reporting to Forrest Norrod, AMD’s data center chief. The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2025, will see AMD retaining about 1,000 of ZT Systems' roughly 2,500 employees. AMD anticipates that the acquisition will positively impact its adjusted financial performance by the end of 2025.

AMZN Earnings Preview- What to watch for tonight.csv,"Earnings from Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. will be crucial in guiding the Nasdaq 100 after a volatile period marked by extreme fluctuations. As the last megacaps to release results before Nvidia Corp. in August, these reports will set the tone for tech investors, particularly focusing on how artificial intelligence is driving growth in Amazon’s cloud-computing unit and boosting demand for Apple's next iPhone. The results will also provide valuable insights into the health of consumer spending, with Amazon shares already up about 25% this year. Amazon.com Inc. is set to release its Q2 earnings report after the market closes, with a conference call scheduled for 5:30 p.m. ET. Analysts project the company will report revenue of $148.8 billion, marking an 11% increase year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up from 65 cents in the same period last year. Amazon has guided for Q2 operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, signaling strong performance despite broader economic challenges. Key metrics expected by analysts include AWS revenue at nearly $26 billion, representing more than 17% year-over-year growth, and advertising revenue projected to reach $13 billion, a 21.7% increase from last year. The Stores segment, bolstered by events like Prime Day, is anticipated to show significant activity, while improvements in operating margins, especially in the North America segment, will be closely watched. Analysts also expect updates on AI initiatives and the overall capital expenditures for the year. Comments from analysts emphasize the importance of AI and cloud services for Amazon's future growth. Citi analysts, led by Ronald Josey, anticipate AWS revenue growth accelerated in Q2 due to generative AI tailwinds, while also predicting a beat in operating income thanks to improved retail efficiencies and strong advertising demand. Truist analyst Youssef Squali highlights Amazon's ability to gain share in global e-commerce and sees multiple growth vectors powering the company's continued expansion. Retail performance and consumer spending trends will be significant indicators, especially given mixed reports this earnings season. Analysts like Matt Stucky of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management note the importance of Amazon's retail margin expansion and its impact on profitability. Additionally, the potential for a surprise dividend announcement is a point of interest, as Amazon remains the last major tech company without a dividend program. Amazon's Q2 results will follow earnings reports from key competitors like Microsoft and Google, both of which had mixed receptions based on their cloud and AI performances. Wall Street's current focus is on tangible returns from AI investments, making Amazon's updates on its AI initiatives and AWS growth crucial for investor sentiment. The company's dominant position in the cloud market and ongoing efforts to enhance its e-commerce offerings will be under the microscope. Amazon saw its stock rise following a strong Q1 earnings report, showcasing impressive upside in both EPS and revenue. The standout metric was a significant 221% year-over-year increase in operating income to $15.31 billion, far surpassing the prior guidance of $8-12 billion. The company’s guidance for Q2 operating income of $10-14 billion also exceeded expectations. The Stores segment performed well, driven by successful shopping events like Amazon's Spring Deal Days in Europe and the first Big Spring Sale in Canada and the US. Faster delivery times, enhanced by regionalization efforts and cost-saving measures such as consolidating units into fewer boxes, boosted customer purchase frequency and overall spend. Additionally, Amazon is preparing for its 10th Prime Day event in July, which is expected to further drive sales. Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the highlight of the quarter, with a 17% growth in constant currency, an improvement from previous quarters. AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue business, with significant growth in both generative and non-generative AI workloads. The Advertising Services segment also showed robust growth, with a 24% increase in revenue to $11.82 billion, driven primarily by sponsored ads and early gains in Prime Video ads. Despite guiding Q2 revenue below consensus due to foreign exchange impacts, the strong performance in AWS and advertising has left investors optimistic.",0.5699,POSITIVE,0.9923

ATH  Leverage  Index Funds and more.csv,"I got a few questions as a newbie Some of the companies I want to invest long-term are either at their ATH or close to ATH, like Microsoft or Nvidia. I'm wondering whether I should wait for it to drop, because most of the stock market is green this year, so I have a feeling it may drop since it grew so much, what do you think? Some of it just recovered from 2022 to it's pre-2022 state, but Nvidia has 205% growth this year, which is crazy Index funds - the legendary S&P 500. Everyone says it's the most stable etc - but I've found other indexes with even better growth. SP500 usually have the 7-10% yearly return and last 5 years went up 56%, but for example the INDEX Vanguard Growth ETF went up 87% for the last 5 years - and it was also a steady growth, not a lucky spike during one period. What do you think, is it really smart to go with SP500 or are there other ones that are much better, even tho SP500 is so hyped by everyone? and if you agree - what other indexes with better return would you recommend? Leverage - I'm not familiar with how much can you leverage in stocks, but for people that invest in the top 10, which most likely will go up in the future, wouldn't be smarter to invest it with i.e 5x leverage, since the companies like Microsoft are stable, and eventually will grow? Stock Math - let's say I invest $10.000 in a stock and it declines -50%. I know have $5.000. If it goes up by 50%, do I get $7.500 or do I get my $10.000 back? Logically the first answer, but something doesn't give me a peace of mind here, so I prefer to ask Eli Lilly - what do you think about this stock? Growed massive amount lately, and pharmaceutical industry will definitely be there in 5 or 10 years.",0.5565,NEGATIVE,0.9857

The $1 trillion threshold was crossed just two days before the “Oracle of Omaha” turns 94 years old. The shares were up 0.8% to $696,502.02 on Wednesday, allowing it to top the $1 trillion mark, per FactSet. The milestone “is a testament to the firm’s financial strength and franchise value,” said Cathy Seifert, Berkshire analyst at CFRA Research. “This is significant at a time when Berkshire represents one of the few remaining conglomerates in existence today.” Unlike the six other companies in the trillion-dollar club (Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta), Berkshire is known for its old-economy focus as the owner of BNSF Railway, Geico Insurance and Dairy Queen.

They also stand to benefit from SMCI’s issues and Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure.

Fundamentals behind a USA market drop this week & some positives.csv,"The problem areas in the USA: -------------------------- *- The Schiller PE is at a very high level. Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble. So stocks are highly expensive. *- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022! We are more of a service economy than a goods economy, *- World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle. That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local sales declines are offset. Additionally the trade war hampers both sides. *- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels. *- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers. You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term. People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank. However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials. AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth. AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales. So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia. This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW. I don't own any MKSI. This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording. So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN. Good areas: -------------------------------------- *- Labor productivity is up consistently since Q3 2022. one can see tradingeconomics dot com USA productivity *- Gasoline is lower than last year *- Retail sales are going fine, [ per a recent NPR radio article ] Nuetral ---------------------------------------- *- Labor force participation is not higher than Sept 2023. No more sales growth from people returning to work. Participation is up recently. tradingeconomics has this info. *- Consumer confidence is still down since January 2020.

Liz Ann Sonders, Chief Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab, pointed out that beneath the surface, the average stock in the Nasdaq has experienced a 37% drawdown, compared to the 7% maximum drawdown of the index from its year-to-date high. This suggests significant churn and rotation not visible when solely looking at index level changes. Further, the share of S&P 500 members trading above their 50-day moving average has dropped below 50%, while the index itself continues to trade above its intermediate-term average by more than 4%.

"Impacting NVDA is underlying logic,what does OpenAI is change in strategy mean.csv","Big model pre-training bottleneck: Silicon Valley AI labs are generally struggling with new model training, with OpenAI's Orion and Google's Gemini 2.0 failing to significantly outperform their predecessors, defying the “law of scaling”. This law used to mean that model performance would continue to increase with data and computation, but the scaling effect has now plateaued. Computing in the reasoning phase: To overcome pre-training bottlenecks, OpenAI and other labs are exploring “compute on test” techniques that enable human-like multi-step reasoning by allowing models to generate and evaluate multiple possibilities in real-time during the reasoning phase. This approach can be used more effectively for complex tasks such as mathematics and coding to optimize reasoning performance. Hardware Demand Shift: Market demand is likely to shift from large-scale pre-training clusters to inference clouds as new technologies reduce parameter requirements. This will weaken NVIDIA's monopoly in the training chip market, and the inference chip market may see more competition, especially as companies such as Groq may fill the new demand. Capital Trends: Venture capital organizations are highly concerned about this change, and are gradually investing more resources in distributed inference clouds to cater to the distributed server needs of inference computing.",0.5346,POSITIVE,0.6048

Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,NEGATIVE,0.9443

The S&P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday’s close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%. Through Dec. 22, the S&P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%. Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said. That didn’t mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote. Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found. Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July. The strategy “indicates the Fed’s measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,” Jakobsen said. The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks’ bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group’s announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering. SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a “mini” banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown. Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks — Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78% , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, 0.16%, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%, Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%, Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%, and Meta Platforms Inc. META, 0.56%. See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024? Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind. The S&P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted. In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high: The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&P 500’s weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted. Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&P 500’s overall return, he wrote, with the company’s success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.",0.5482,NEGATIVE,0.9995
Mega-caps vs small caps.csv,"The current state of the stock market exhibits a stark contrast between the performance of mega-cap and small-cap stocks, as investors grapple with mixed signals from major corporations and broader market indices.  Recent developments have highlighted this divide, with Microsoft's upcoming earnings report set to further shape the narrative. Mega-Cap Weakness and Market Impact Microsoft, a key player in the technology sector, is set to report its earnings after the market close, and its performance could significantly influence investor sentiment.  The recent underperformance of large-cap stocks like Merck and Procter & Gamble, both of which have disappointed with earnings guidance, has contributed to the Nasdaq Composite's (-0.9%) and S&P 500's (-0.4%) downward pressure.  This weakness is reflected in the Vanguard Mega-Cap Growth ETF (MGK), which is down 1.1%. Small-Cap Resilience In contrast, small-cap stocks have shown relative strength, with the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 Value Index posting gains.  The equal-weighted S&P 500 is also holding its own, indicating that smaller companies are providing a stabilizing force in the market.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, buoyed by the financials and energy sectors, adds to this resilience. Sectors in Focus The IT sector, weighed down by NVIDIA's (-5.0%) decline ahead of AMD's earnings release, is leading the pack of losers.  Consumer staples, also negatively impacted, are lagging behind. On the other hand, financials, and energy sectors are posting gains, offering a glimmer of hope for investors seeking opportunities. Treasuries and Market Sentiment The Treasury market remains relatively calm, with the 2-yr note yield down to 4.38% and the 10-yr note yield at 4.17%.  Economic indicators, such as the better-than-expected consumer confidence index and the Bank of Japan's policy decision, have not sparked significant market movements, suggesting that investors are cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's FOMC decision on Wednesday. As we await Microsoft's earnings report, the stock market's divide between mega-cap and small-cap stocks is a cause for concern, especially for those relying on large-cap performance.  However, the resilience of small-cap companies and select sectors is providing a silver lining. Investors should stay vigilant, monitor market reactions to key earnings releases, and consider a diversified portfolio that takes into account the current market dynamics.  The Federal Reserve's decision will likely play a crucial role in determining the market's next course of action.",0.5419,NEGATIVE,0.9136

MSFT faces long-term potential disadvantages.csv,"I think one of the main reasons Microsoft is a great long-term investment is its long history of generating a lot of free cash flow. At the time of writing, the company's free cash flow margin is over 30%, with free cash flow rising from $15.9 billion in 2009 to $74.1 billion in the last 12 months. This financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments. While Microsoft may not seem like a value investment, in my opinion, its pricing is reasonable given its continued revenue and earnings growth, and it's likely to continue for the foreseeable future. I estimate EPS growth of 13% on a regular basis over the next 12 months. Based on this projection, I have a price target of $482.40 and estimate that the stock will trade at a non-GAAP P/E ratio of around 36. Looking ahead, I expect Microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15% over the next 5 to 10 years. While this prospect necessitates buying the stock at a fair valuation, I believe the current price provides an opportunity. The company's forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is only 6.5% above its five-year average, while its forward diluted earnings per share growth rate is nearly the same at 5.8%. MSFT faces long-term potential headwinds One potential challenge to Microsoft's long-term growth in AI is that its adoption can be cyclical. Currently, the demand for AI systems is high, which has prompted Microsoft and other big tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion. However, when the current trend peaks (likely due to macroeconomic constraints), growth may slow. According to the TipRanks risk analysis tool, Microsoft is exposed to 32% risk from legal and regulatory factors, which is higher than the industry average and could impact its AI operations due to increased scrutiny of data privacy and AI governance. Given this outlook, I expect some volatility in Microsoft's long-term growth trajectory, although it may not be as good as NVIDIA NVDA -0.06% ▼ and so on semiconductor companies so obvious. As market sentiment fluctuates, cyclical price and valuation declines coincide with temporarily lower growth rates and may provide more attractive buying opportunities. There is also a risk that Microsoft and other Big Tech players could over-invest in AI infrastructure. With 21% of its risk related to Tech & Innovation, Microsoft’s heavy investment in AI-driven initiatives, including data center infrastructure, could result in lower-than-expected returns if industry growth does not meet expectations. This may impact free cash flow margins in the medium term, contributing to further volatility.",0.5607,NEGATIVE,0.8794

The demand for its AI GPUs remains high, the company has been receiving upward revisions recently, and its stock is trading around its all-time high levels with a potential to appreciate even further in the upcoming months.

Nvidia announces 50 billion stock buyback.csv,"Nvidia said Wednesday that its board of directors has approved a $50 billion stock buyback. The computer chip giant announced the share repurchase as part of its fiscal second-quarter earnings, in which it reported earnings and guidance that surpassed Wall Street expectations. Nvidia returned $15.4 billion to shareholders in share repurposes and cash dividends as part of the company’s first half of its fiscal 2025. The company said it had $7.5 billion remaining under its share repurchase plan, as of the end of its fiscal second quarter. Last year, Nvidia announced a $25 billion share buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results. Companies often experience a boom to their stock price after revealing stock buyback plans. In May, for instance, Apple announced a $110 billion stock buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results that showed overall sales fell 4% year over year and iPhone sales dropped 10% year over year. However, the iPhone maker’s shares rose 7% in after-hours trading, likely because Apple’s share buyback was the biggest in corporate history. With Nvidia’s shares dropping 4% in extended trading despite reporting solid financial results and announcing a stock buyback, some experts believe the company has been doing so well that it is getting harder to impress investors.

Nvidia More Room to Run Just Getting Started.csv,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they’ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don’t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical. Yes, Nvidia’s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn’t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now. Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn’t possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia’s place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn’t happened and Nvidia’s only gotten stronger. That’s not to say over time Nvidia won’t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it’s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution. Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations.

Powell's comments on interest rates, the economy, and any indication that inflationary pressures are driving a reassessment of the Fed's present aims will be scrutinized. On the corporate front, Nvidia headlines the earnings story this week, with the chipmaker scheduled to publish data from a quarter that caused the chipmaker to increase its revenue forecast by 50%. Lowe's, BJ's Wholesale Club, and Peloton are also set to announce earnings this week. August is shaping up to be the worst month for stocks this year, with all three main averages closing last week lower after a hawkish read of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting sent equities lower and Treasury rates higher in the second half of the week. Economic data continues to come in stronger than expected, with the July retail sales report indicating a 0.7% increase in sales for the month, about double what economists forecast. The AtlantaFed's GDPNow projection now predicts third-quarter GDP growth of 5.8%, the strongest rate since the fourth quarter of 2021. Inflation has declined dramatically since Powell's Jackson Hole speech last year, when he predicted rates will climb until the ""job is done,"" lowering inflation. Powell has stated as recently as July that inflation is ""well above"" the Fed's long-run objective of 2%. On the corporate front, all eyes will be on Nvidia, which predicted that artificial intelligence demand will increase its current quarter sales projection from $7 billion to $11 billion. Nvidia stock is up about 200% year to date, but its gains have slowed along with the market since mid-July.

Nvidia's Unprecedented 875% Growth A Metric Bulls and Bears Must See.csv,"Whether you’re bullish or bearish on Nvidia, there’s one metric you need to consider before making your next move. Historical data since 1990 shows no current S&P 500 company has achieved what Nvidia just did: growing its Last Twelve Months (LTM) Net Income from $4 billion to $42.6 billion in just six quarters. The closest comparison is Ford’s growth from $4.5 billion to $23.1 billion over the same 6-quarters duration from 1996 to 1998. Nvidia’s (CQGR) over the past six quarters stands at an astounding 57.70%, translating to a total growth rate of 875.23%. 57.70% is quarterly rate, not the more common (CAGR). While some might label this explosive growth as a market top or even fraudulent, others see it as the dawn of an extraordinary growth phase that could continue indefinitely.

"Oracle bumps up fiscal 2026 revenue forecast, lifting stock 6%.csv","Oracle lifted its fiscal 2026 revenue forecast on Thursday, pushing its stock up nearly 6% in after-hours trading. The tech giant now anticipates at least $66 billion in revenue for fiscal 2026, about $1.5 billion higher than analysts’ estimates. Looking further ahead, Oracle projects over $104 billion in revenue by fiscal 2029, along with a 20% year-over-year growth in earnings per share. Speaking at the Oracle CloudWorld event in Las Vegas, CEO Safra Catz expressed confidence in achieving these ambitious targets, pointing to new partnerships that allow Oracle’s database software to be offered through major cloud providers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Oracle’s strong performance continued this week as its stock gained roughly 15% over the past three trading days, setting a new record and marking a 55% increase for the year—second only to Nvidia among large-cap tech companies. Oracle’s cloud infrastructure revenue jumped 45% last quarter, outpacing its competitors and benefiting from businesses transitioning their workloads to the cloud. The company is also positioning itself to capitalize on the growing demand for artificial intelligence, announcing its cloud unit has secured orders for over 131,000 next-generation Nvidia GPUs. As Oracle scales up its cloud and AI capabilities, it plans to double its capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 to support this growth, signaling continued momentum in its expansion efforts.

Qualcomm Approached Intel About a Takeover in Recent Days.csv,"Qualcomm recently approached Intel with a takeover proposal, marking what could be one of the largest tech deals in recent memory, according to sources. Intel, once valued at over $290 billion, has seen its market cap fall to around $90 billion after a challenging year in which its shares dropped 60%. While a deal is far from guaranteed, Qualcomm’s interest comes as Intel struggles to recover under CEO Pat Gelsinger’s turnaround plan, which has yet to deliver significant results. Should Intel be receptive, the deal could face heavy antitrust scrutiny, though some argue it might bolster U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor industry. Qualcomm may consider offloading parts of Intel to complete the acquisition. Both companies have sought to capitalize on the AI boom, though they’ve lagged behind Nvidia. Intel, grappling with factory delays and cost-cutting measures, is receiving government subsidies as part of its efforts to build chip factories. A Qualcomm takeover could enhance its portfolio by adding Intel’s dominance in PCs and servers to its smartphone chip business. Despite this potential merger, Intel continues to face major hurdles, including the possible need to split its design and manufacturing operations amid growing calls for the company to separate its business divisions.

Serious question from someone who took a four-year trading break.csv,Hey everyone After a long long hiatus and licking my wounds I decided to try trading once again. Recently I've been changing up my approach and doing 5-7 DTE spy options. And it's been going pretty decent however recently I got a couple of August 30th calls for Nvidia I managed to get in at a good position for 133 calls. My thesis is that it's going to keep pumping up to the day of earnings. I don't have any intention of holding the position up until expiration. My question is regarding theta decay and volatility. I know that the closer I got to the expiration the less profit I'll see as a percentage of my position. And I also understand that during high levels of volatility it can go both ways. And I'm not really asking for specific advice just kind of guidance or knowledge as to how that may affect my position. I'm holding them over the weekend and I'm expecting Monday to start off a little red but to finish off green and so I'm not quite sure if I want to sell half my positions and wait till earnings or if I should wait to earnings in general. I strongly believe that Nvidia is going to beat their earnings I just don't know how drastically that's going to affect the price action. Any and all input is definitely appreciated Thanks in advance,0.5421,NEGATIVE,0.9936

Super Micro Falls as Hindenburg Takes Aim With Short Report.csv,"Super Micro Computer Inc.'s shares took a hit on Tuesday following a short report from Hindenburg Research that questioned the company's financial practices and transparency. Hindenburg's report alleged significant accounting red flags, undisclosed related-party transactions, and potential violations of sanctions and export controls. Initially, the report caused Super Micro's stock to plummet by as much as 8.7%, but it later rebounded to close down 2.6%. The server manufacturer has been a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, with its high-performance servers in high demand for data centers. This surge in AI-related demand has driven significant growth for the company, doubling its revenue to $14.9 billion in the most recent fiscal year. Despite a steep decline from its March peak, Super Micro's stock remains up over 90% for the year, reflecting continued investor interest in the burgeoning AI sector. However, the Hindenburg report could intensify scrutiny on Super Micro's accounting practices and client relationships, particularly as the company has faced regulatory challenges in the past. In 2020, Super Micro resolved a U.S. SEC investigation by correcting its financial statements and paying a penalty for accounting issues from 2014 to 2017. As the AI market continues to expand, maintaining investor confidence will be crucial for Super Micro, especially amid concerns about the profitability of AI-optimized servers and the potential for increased regulatory oversight.

Technical Analysis Lesson - Reversal Day in Nvidia (NVDA).csv,"Every trader wants to know when the trend is changing from up to down or down to up. This happens when the leadership in the market changes from bulls to bears or bears to bulls. These trend changes are what every trader looks for. If they can accurately predict market turns, they can profit. That’s why they do what they do. Sometimes this change of leadership is slow and takes a long period of time to happen. These changes have price action that tends to show up on a chart as a ‘Rounded Top’ or ‘Rounded Bottom’ pattern. Sometimes the reversal is abrupt and takes place over a few time periods. This action tends to show up on a chart as a ‘V’ or ‘Inverted V’ reversal. But sometimes the trend changes just in one day... These dynamics can show up on a chart as a ‘Reversal Day’ pattern. One may have just happened in the stock of Nivida (NVDA). The Western world would call it an ‘Outside Reversal Day’. In candlestick terminology, it is called a ‘Bearish Engulfing Pattern’. It’s important to note that these candlestick patterns are at least 700 years old. They were developed by Japanese rice traders. It shows that the human nature which is illustrated in charts hasn’t changed. The name doesn’t matter. The action that it illustrates does. On Friday morning, it looked as though the uptrend in NVDA was going to continue for yet another day. It opened at a higher price than Thursday’s close. But then the tide turned… Over the day, the sellers came out of the woodwork. And not only did they hold off the assault. They overpowered the buyers and eventually pushed the price much lower. Importantly, Friday’s closing price was lower than Thursday’s opening price. This is frequently a characteristic of a trend that is reversing. Sometimes the change of leadership from bulls to bears happens over an extended time-period. But sometimes it occurs in just one day. That could be the case here.",0.5201,NEGATIVE,0.9938

Yes the stock is expensive right now, but given the growth opportunity I would argue there is still plenty of room for expansion. Yes, China is a threat, but something tells me that China would not dare suffer the economic sanctions western nations would impose if they made a move in Taiwan. Trump has said he would likely put tariffs on the Taiwan semiconductor industry in order to grow domestic production, but still with tariffs, I don’t see big players switching to alternatives, as the gap between TSM and alternatives is very large.

TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand.csv,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

Whenever i see them in the market, if NVIDIA is up 3%, they are up 6%, but if NVIDIA is down 3%, they are down 6-7%. Is it still a buy even though it has risen almost 50% this year?

Understand this about INTC.csv,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Free float are shares that are readily available for trade, excludes shares that are locked up from insiders. I'm still a bit confused to what free float market cap is.

Why am I bullish on SFY instead of SPY.csv,"A comparison analysis between the holdings of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY), I have compiled information from the most recent available data. Below is a table showing the top 10 holdings for each ETF along with their percentage weight in the respective ETFs. This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings: Data Sources: SPY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Schwab, Yahoo Finance. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST) SFY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Zacks.com, Yahoo Finance. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST) Key Observations: Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting. It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation. I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors: Expense Ratio: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. Stock Selection Methodology: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. Performance Trends: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. Portfolio Diversification: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. Market Positioning: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. Innovative Approach of SoFi: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy. It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.

"Why Are Analysts Increasing NVIDIA’s Price Target Is It Out of Fear That Something Bad Will Happen, .csv","NVIDIA, often considered the heart of AI stocks, has recently been in the spotlight as analysts uniformly raise their stock targets. To me, this trend seems somewhat peculiar, even considering the current earnings season. The buoyant optimism surrounding the stock’s potential rise is sparking doubt in my mind. Should the stock underperform, it will be a litmus test of these analysts’ sincerity, raising questions about whether they may be manipulating public sentiment. In the broader context of the semiconductor sector, the recent quarterly earnings have been largely underwhelming. Yet, all semiconductor stocks appear to be buoyed by NVIDIA’s momentum. A stumble in NVIDIA’s stock could trigger a broader tech market downfall, while success could reignite a bullish trend for tech stocks. My intuition, however, leans towards a potential disappointment. NVIDIA might surpass current estimates but simultaneously lower their future guidance due to sluggish growth. Should this occur, a significant drop in stock price could follow. Disclaimer: These thoughts are purely my own observations and should not be taken as financial advice.",0.542,NEGATIVE,0.9983

Worse case scenario the perfect Bear cocktail.csv,"After reading all the comments from my last post and doing some more thinking. I decided to entertain the idea of what would be the perfect Bear cocktail that could trigger a Stock Market destabilization. I'm not taking into account any type of positive news. I'm simply going the negative route, in a slow and systematic manner, without any huge trigger events. What am I missing and at what dates that's important and could also add to this? If you notice in the prior post list, three out of six times... rising interest rates were part of the cause that brought the market down at least 20%. Oil price shocks two out of 6. Then there´s speculative investments at the dotcom bubble. Covid, overvaluation, trade tensions... Stagflation. So these have to be in the mix one way or another: Cocktail Potential Ingredients: Rising interest rates. Oil price shocks. Speculative tech investments. Overvaluation. Trade tensions. Stagflation. New round of Covid-19. Housing or Commercial Real Estate Bubble. So this is the speculative worse case scenario we could have without going as far as having a WWIII: February 13, 2024: CPI report comes in hot. S&P500 comes down 1.5%, some buy the tiny dip. February 15, 2024: Jobless claims rise. Doesn't alter the market but adds to the cocktail mix. February 16, 2024: A higher-than-expected PPI indicates increasing costs at the producer level, which can signal rising inflationary pressures. Producers might pass these higher costs onto consumers, leading to an increase in consumer prices and overall inflation. The Fed to consider tightening monetary policy more aggressively than previously anticipated to combat inflation. This could include raising interest rates or adjusting the pace of tapering asset purchases. Financial markets don't react negatively to a higher-than-expected PPI, as it they priced it in from the CPI report. February 21, 2024: Nvidia posts earnings, they actually do fine but investors realize that´s gonna be the ceiling for now so the stock falls 15%. Other tech stocks get stained by the fear, bringing the S&P500 2.5% lower. AI investment sentiments leans towards potentially speculative for now. March 12, 2024: February´s CPI report comes in hot again, causing Algorithmic trades to sell and bring down the S&P500 another 2%. March 19-20, 2024: FOMC Meeting gives subtext of potentially not bringing interest rates down yet. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterates emphasis on the central bank's commitment to combating inflation, even if it requires keeping interest rates high for an extended period. This brings down the market sentiment down and numbers another 1%.

Currently at 4,600... 7.5% below all time highs. May 1, 2024: FOMC Meeting leaves a bad taste in mouth. Jerome shifts narrative towards not lowering interests rates yet. Market falls another 2.5% on the bad sentiment. May 15, 2024: Situations in the Middle East, such as tensions in Gaza or Iran, could impact global oil supplies by affecting regional stability and energy infrastructure. Saudi Arabia, a key OPEC member, might alter its oil production strategy in response to shifts in global politics, economic pressures, or changes in energy demand. Actions perceived as irrational could stem from strategic decisions to protect national interests, influence oil prices, or respond to international events. S&P500 falls 0.5%. July 8, 2024: A new wave of Covid-19 actually breaks through the collective deceit of it being over because death rates rise significantly and word spreads out again from hospital staff that's it's getting real bad. Stock market reacts in a mixed manner. Amazon and tech companies go up a little, small caps enter another bad rout. S&P500 falls 1%. July 20, 2024: Numbers start to confirm a Stagflation situation actually taking place.

AMD to acquire server builder ZT Systems for 49 billion in cash and stock.csv,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced on Monday its plans to acquire server manufacturer ZT Systems for $4.9 billion, as part of its strategy to bolster its portfolio of artificial intelligence (AI) chips and hardware, and to compete more effectively against Nvidia. The acquisition will be financed with 75% cash and the remaining in stock, leveraging AMD’s $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments reported in the second quarter. The rising demands of AI computing have necessitated the use of thousands of interconnected chips to achieve the required processing power, making the design and construction of server systems increasingly critical. This acquisition will enable AMD to enhance its capabilities in this area. According to AMD CEO Lisa Su, the addition of ZT Systems’ engineers will accelerate the company’s ability to test and deploy its latest AI GPUs on a scale required by major cloud computing companies like Microsoft. Although AMD plans to incorporate ZT Systems into its operations, it has no intention of competing directly in the server manufacturing market. Instead, the company plans to divest its server manufacturing business after the acquisition is finalized, with no discussions yet held with potential buyers. ZT Systems CEO Frank Zhang will join AMD, reporting to Forrest Norrod, AMD’s data center chief. The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2025, will see AMD retaining about 1,000 of ZT Systems' roughly 2,500 employees.

AMZN Earnings Preview- What to watch for tonight.csv,"Earnings from Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. will be crucial in guiding the Nasdaq 100 after a volatile period marked by extreme fluctuations. As the last megacaps to release results before Nvidia Corp. in August, these reports will set the tone for tech investors, particularly focusing on how artificial intelligence is driving growth in Amazon’s cloud-computing unit and boosting demand for Apple's next iPhone. The results will also provide valuable insights into the health of consumer spending, with Amazon shares already up about 25% this year. Amazon.com Inc. is set to release its Q2 earnings report after the market closes, with a conference call scheduled for 5:30 p.m. ET. Analysts project the company will report revenue of $148.8 billion, marking an 11% increase year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up from 65 cents in the same period last year. Amazon has guided for Q2 operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, signaling strong performance despite broader economic challenges. Key metrics expected by analysts include AWS revenue at nearly $26 billion, representing more than 17% year-over-year growth, and advertising revenue projected to reach $13 billion, a 21.7% increase from last year. The Stores segment, bolstered by events like Prime Day, is anticipated to show significant activity, while improvements in operating margins, especially in the North America segment, will be closely watched. Analysts also expect updates on AI initiatives and the overall capital expenditures for the year. Comments from analysts emphasize the importance of AI and cloud services for Amazon's future growth. Citi analysts, led by Ronald Josey, anticipate AWS revenue growth accelerated in Q2 due to generative AI tailwinds, while also predicting a beat in operating income thanks to improved retail efficiencies and strong advertising demand. Truist analyst Youssef Squali highlights Amazon's ability to gain share in global e-commerce and sees multiple growth vectors powering the company's continued expansion. Retail performance and consumer spending trends will be significant indicators, especially given mixed reports this earnings season. Analysts like Matt Stucky of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management note the importance of Amazon's retail margin expansion and its impact on profitability. Additionally, the potential for a surprise dividend announcement is a point of interest, as Amazon remains the last major tech company without a dividend program. Amazon's Q2 results will follow earnings reports from key competitors like Microsoft and Google, both of which had mixed receptions based on their cloud and AI performances. Wall Street's current focus is on tangible returns from AI investments, making Amazon's updates on its AI initiatives and AWS growth crucial for investor sentiment. The company's dominant position in the cloud market and ongoing efforts to enhance its e-commerce offerings will be under the microscope. Amazon saw its stock rise following a strong Q1 earnings report, showcasing impressive upside in both EPS and revenue. The standout metric was a significant 221% year-over-year increase in operating income to $15.31 billion, far surpassing the prior guidance of $8-12 billion. The company’s guidance for Q2 operating income of $10-14 billion also exceeded expectations. The Stores segment performed well, driven by successful shopping events like Amazon's Spring Deal Days in Europe and the first Big Spring Sale in Canada and the US. Faster delivery times, enhanced by regionalization efforts and cost-saving measures such as consolidating units into fewer boxes, boosted customer purchase frequency and overall spend. Additionally, Amazon is preparing for its 10th Prime Day event in July, which is expected to further drive sales. Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the highlight of the quarter, with a 17% growth in constant currency, an improvement from previous quarters. AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue business, with significant growth in both generative and non-generative AI workloads. The Advertising Services segment also showed robust growth, with a 24% increase in revenue to $11.82 billion, driven primarily by sponsored ads and early gains in Prime Video ads.

ATH  Leverage  Index Funds and more.csv,"I got a few questions as a newbie Some of the companies I want to invest long-term are either at their ATH or close to ATH, like Microsoft or Nvidia. I'm wondering whether I should wait for it to drop, because most of the stock market is green this year, so I have a feeling it may drop since it grew so much, what do you think? Some of it just recovered from 2022 to it's pre-2022 state, but Nvidia has 205% growth this year, which is crazy Index funds - the legendary S&P 500. Everyone says it's the most stable etc - but I've found other indexes with even better growth. SP500 usually have the 7-10% yearly return and last 5 years went up 56%, but for example the INDEX Vanguard Growth ETF went up 87% for the last 5 years - and it was also a steady growth, not a lucky spike during one period. What do you think, is it really smart to go with SP500 or are there other ones that are much better, even tho SP500 is so hyped by everyone? and if you agree - what other indexes with better return would you recommend? Leverage - I'm not familiar with how much can you leverage in stocks, but for people that invest in the top 10, which most likely will go up in the future, wouldn't be smarter to invest it with i.e 5x leverage, since the companies like Microsoft are stable, and eventually will grow? Stock Math - let's say I invest $10.000 in a stock and it declines -50%. I know have $5.000. If it goes up by 50%, do I get $7.500 or do I get my $10.000 back? Logically the first answer, but something doesn't give me a peace of mind here, so I prefer to ask Eli Lilly - what do you think about this stock? Growed massive amount lately, and pharmaceutical industry will definitely be there in 5 or 10 years.",0.5565,NEGATIVE,0.9857

The $1 trillion threshold was crossed just two days before the “Oracle of Omaha” turns 94 years old. The shares were up 0.8% to $696,502.02 on Wednesday, allowing it to top the $1 trillion mark, per FactSet. The milestone “is a testament to the firm’s financial strength and franchise value,” said Cathy Seifert, Berkshire analyst at CFRA Research. “This is significant at a time when Berkshire represents one of the few remaining conglomerates in existence today.” Unlike the six other companies in the trillion-dollar club (Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta), Berkshire is known for its old-economy focus as the owner of BNSF Railway, Geico Insurance and Dairy Queen.

Fundamentals behind a USA market drop this week & some positives.csv,"The problem areas in the USA: -------------------------- *- The Schiller PE is at a very high level. Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble. So stocks are highly expensive. *- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022! We are more of a service economy than a goods economy, *- World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle. That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local sales declines are offset. Additionally the trade war hampers both sides. *- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels. *- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers. You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term. People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank. However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials. AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth. AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales. So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia. This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW. I don't own any MKSI. This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording. So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN. Good areas: -------------------------------------- *- Labor productivity is up consistently since Q3 2022. one can see tradingeconomics dot com USA productivity *- Gasoline is lower than last year *- Retail sales are going fine, [ per a recent NPR radio article ] Nuetral ---------------------------------------- *- Labor force participation is not higher than Sept 2023. No more sales growth from people returning to work. Participation is up recently. tradingeconomics has this info. *- Consumer confidence is still down since January 2020.

These seven stocks, which include tech giants like Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft, have driven much of the market’s gains, with Apple rising 8%, Nvidia up 9%, and Microsoft increasing by 4% last week alone.

Liz Ann Sonders, Chief Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab, pointed out that beneath the surface, the average stock in the Nasdaq has experienced a 37% drawdown, compared to the 7% maximum drawdown of the index from its year-to-date high. This suggests significant churn and rotation not visible when solely looking at index level changes. Further, the share of S&P 500 members trading above their 50-day moving average has dropped below 50%, while the index itself continues to trade above its intermediate-term average by more than 4%.

HPE Undervalued Tech Giant on the Rise!.csv,"I'm excited to share some incredible updates and insights about Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) that could make it a standout investment opportunity in the tech space. Key Growth Points: Innovative Financial as a Service (IFaaS): HPE's IFaaS is experiencing explosive growth, with an annual revenue rate soaring at 39%. This innovative service model is quickly becoming a cornerstone of HPE's strategy, driving substantial recurring revenue. AI Systems Revenue: AI is the future, and HPE is at the forefront. Their AI systems revenue has more than doubled from Q1 to Q2, hitting an impressive $900 million. This rapid growth underscores HPE's strong positioning in the AI market. Massive AI Systems Orders: The cumulative orders for HPE’s AI systems have reached a staggering $4.6 billion, maintaining a robust double-digit quarterly growth pace. This is a clear indicator of the high demand and trust in HPE’s AI solutions. Cutting-Edge Liquid Cooling Technology: HPE holds over 300 patents in the area of direct liquid cooling. This technology is crucial for managing the power demands of accelerated compute silicon designs, making HPE a leader in sustainable and efficient computing solutions. Strategic Partnership with NVIDIA (NVDA): HPE's collaboration with NVIDIA enhances their AI capabilities and product offerings. This partnership further solidifies HPE's position in the high-performance computing and AI markets. Valuation Compared to Peers: Despite these impressive metrics, HPE is significantly undervalued. It’s trading at just 8 times revenue, compared to Dell’s 19 times. This discrepancy highlights a potential for substantial upside as the market recognizes HPE's value. Why HPE? HPE is not just another tech company; it's a powerhouse of innovation and growth. Their strategic focus on AI, IFaaS, and advanced cooling technologies is driving significant revenue increases and solidifying their market position. As the tech landscape evolves, HPE is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends and deliver outstanding returns to investors. Conclusion: HPE's growth story is compelling and their current undervaluation offers a unique investment opportunity. With a strong trajectory in AI, IFaaS, and liquid cooling technology, HPE is poised to deliver exceptional value. If you’re looking for a tech stock with solid fundamentals and growth potential, HPE should definitely be on your radar.",0.5592,POSITIVE,0.9995

Yes it is crazily valued at the moment but still with the event they held yesterday and overall their direction, even if everyone hates Elon Musk, it also seems clear to me that Tesla will pack a lot more than what it currently is. The robotaxis, tesla robot, their battery techs, their knowledge in vision and ML and a lot more things will start to pay off eventually. After the event, I expected today to see a growth in Tesla but it was down by %3? Is everyone waiting a lower point of entry? Or are people just not impressed by the event and the promises? What am I not understanding and missing here?",0.5503,NEGATIVE,0.9979
"Impacting NVDA is underlying logic,what does OpenAI is change in strategy mean.csv","Big model pre-training bottleneck: Silicon Valley AI labs are generally struggling with new model training, with OpenAI's Orion and Google's Gemini 2.0 failing to significantly outperform their predecessors, defying the “law of scaling”. This law used to mean that model performance would continue to increase with data and computation, but the scaling effect has now plateaued. Computing in the reasoning phase: To overcome pre-training bottlenecks, OpenAI and other labs are exploring “compute on test” techniques that enable human-like multi-step reasoning by allowing models to generate and evaluate multiple possibilities in real-time during the reasoning phase. This approach can be used more effectively for complex tasks such as mathematics and coding to optimize reasoning performance. Hardware Demand Shift: Market demand is likely to shift from large-scale pre-training clusters to inference clouds as new technologies reduce parameter requirements. This will weaken NVIDIA's monopoly in the training chip market, and the inference chip market may see more competition, especially as companies such as Groq may fill the new demand. Capital Trends: Venture capital organizations are highly concerned about this change, and are gradually investing more resources in distributed inference clouds to cater to the distributed server needs of inference computing.",0.5346,POSITIVE,0.6048

Intel potential comeback.csv,"Hey! Intel seems like a company that's really struggling right now. Their stock just dropped to around $20.16, and it’s not just the GPU market giving them trouble. They’re battling issues on multiple fronts. First off, their foundry business (where they manufacture chips) is bleeding money – about $7 billion in annual losses! They’re not expected to break even there until at least 2027. On top of that, they’re losing market share to AMD and Nvidia, both in CPUs and GPUs. Nvidia is dominating with AI, and AMD is taking more and more of the gaming market. It also feels like they completely missed the whole AI boom. Nvidia is raking in insane profits, while Intel seems to be… just watching? And to make things worse, their CEO recently stepped down, which makes their future even more uncertain. That said, they’ve just launched their new Arc B580 and B570 budget GPUs. Nvidia and AMD seem more focused on AI and data centers right now, so maybe Intel has a shot at carving out a space in gaming? But is that really enough to turn things around? What do you guys think?

Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,NEGATIVE,0.9443

With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia’s chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like AMD are gaining steam, and Nvidia’s own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant. How that plays out over the next few years is anyone’s guess.

Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&P 500 gains.csv,"= just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing = The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023 https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9 The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions. It’s an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve’s inflation battle, noted FactSet’s Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post. The 10 top performing days for the S&P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%. The S&P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday’s close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%. Through Dec. 22, the S&P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%. Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said. That didn’t mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote. Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found. Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July. The strategy “indicates the Fed’s measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,” Jakobsen said. The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks’ bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group’s announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering. SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a “mini” banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown. Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks — Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78% , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, 0.16%, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%, Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%, Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%, and Meta Platforms Inc. META, 0.56%. See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024? Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind. The S&P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted. In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high: The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&P 500’s weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted. Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&P 500’s overall return, he wrote, with the company’s success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.",0.5482,NEGATIVE,0.9995
Mega-caps vs small caps.csv,"The current state of the stock market exhibits a stark contrast between the performance of mega-cap and small-cap stocks, as investors grapple with mixed signals from major corporations and broader market indices.  Recent developments have highlighted this divide, with Microsoft's upcoming earnings report set to further shape the narrative. Mega-Cap Weakness and Market Impact Microsoft, a key player in the technology sector, is set to report its earnings after the market close, and its performance could significantly influence investor sentiment.  The recent underperformance of large-cap stocks like Merck and Procter & Gamble, both of which have disappointed with earnings guidance, has contributed to the Nasdaq Composite's (-0.9%) and S&P 500's (-0.4%) downward pressure.  This weakness is reflected in the Vanguard Mega-Cap Growth ETF (MGK), which is down 1.1%. Small-Cap Resilience In contrast, small-cap stocks have shown relative strength, with the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 Value Index posting gains.  The equal-weighted S&P 500 is also holding its own, indicating that smaller companies are providing a stabilizing force in the market.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, buoyed by the financials and energy sectors, adds to this resilience. Sectors in Focus The IT sector, weighed down by NVIDIA's (-5.0%) decline ahead of AMD's earnings release, is leading the pack of losers.  Consumer staples, also negatively impacted, are lagging behind. On the other hand, financials, and energy sectors are posting gains, offering a glimmer of hope for investors seeking opportunities. Treasuries and Market Sentiment The Treasury market remains relatively calm, with the 2-yr note yield down to 4.38% and the 10-yr note yield at 4.17%.  Economic indicators, such as the better-than-expected consumer confidence index and the Bank of Japan's policy decision, have not sparked significant market movements, suggesting that investors are cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's FOMC decision on Wednesday. As we await Microsoft's earnings report, the stock market's divide between mega-cap and small-cap stocks is a cause for concern, especially for those relying on large-cap performance.  However, the resilience of small-cap companies and select sectors is providing a silver lining. Investors should stay vigilant, monitor market reactions to key earnings releases, and consider a diversified portfolio that takes into account the current market dynamics.  The Federal Reserve's decision will likely play a crucial role in determining the market's next course of action.",0.5419,NEGATIVE,0.9136

MSFT faces long-term potential disadvantages.csv,"I think one of the main reasons Microsoft is a great long-term investment is its long history of generating a lot of free cash flow. At the time of writing, the company's free cash flow margin is over 30%, with free cash flow rising from $15.9 billion in 2009 to $74.1 billion in the last 12 months. This financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments. While Microsoft may not seem like a value investment, in my opinion, its pricing is reasonable given its continued revenue and earnings growth, and it's likely to continue for the foreseeable future. I estimate EPS growth of 13% on a regular basis over the next 12 months. Based on this projection, I have a price target of $482.40 and estimate that the stock will trade at a non-GAAP P/E ratio of around 36. Looking ahead, I expect Microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15% over the next 5 to 10 years. While this prospect necessitates buying the stock at a fair valuation, I believe the current price provides an opportunity. The company's forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is only 6.5% above its five-year average, while its forward diluted earnings per share growth rate is nearly the same at 5.8%. MSFT faces long-term potential headwinds One potential challenge to Microsoft's long-term growth in AI is that its adoption can be cyclical. Currently, the demand for AI systems is high, which has prompted Microsoft and other big tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion. However, when the current trend peaks (likely due to macroeconomic constraints), growth may slow. According to the TipRanks risk analysis tool, Microsoft is exposed to 32% risk from legal and regulatory factors, which is higher than the industry average and could impact its AI operations due to increased scrutiny of data privacy and AI governance. Given this outlook, I expect some volatility in Microsoft's long-term growth trajectory, although it may not be as good as NVIDIA NVDA -0.06% ▼ and so on semiconductor companies so obvious. As market sentiment fluctuates, cyclical price and valuation declines coincide with temporarily lower growth rates and may provide more attractive buying opportunities. There is also a risk that Microsoft and other Big Tech players could over-invest in AI infrastructure. With 21% of its risk related to Tech & Innovation, Microsoft’s heavy investment in AI-driven initiatives, including data center infrastructure, could result in lower-than-expected returns if industry growth does not meet expectations. This may impact free cash flow margins in the medium term, contributing to further volatility.",0.5607,NEGATIVE,0.8794

Nvidia announces 50 billion stock buyback.csv,"Nvidia said Wednesday that its board of directors has approved a $50 billion stock buyback. The computer chip giant announced the share repurchase as part of its fiscal second-quarter earnings, in which it reported earnings and guidance that surpassed Wall Street expectations. Nvidia returned $15.4 billion to shareholders in share repurposes and cash dividends as part of the company’s first half of its fiscal 2025. The company said it had $7.5 billion remaining under its share repurchase plan, as of the end of its fiscal second quarter. Last year, Nvidia announced a $25 billion share buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results. Companies often experience a boom to their stock price after revealing stock buyback plans. In May, for instance, Apple announced a $110 billion stock buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results that showed overall sales fell 4% year over year and iPhone sales dropped 10% year over year. However, the iPhone maker’s shares rose 7% in after-hours trading, likely because Apple’s share buyback was the biggest in corporate history. With Nvidia’s shares dropping 4% in extended trading despite reporting solid financial results and announcing a stock buyback, some experts believe the company has been doing so well that it is getting harder to impress investors.

Nvidia More Room to Run Just Getting Started.csv,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they’ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don’t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical. Yes, Nvidia’s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn’t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now. Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn’t possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia’s place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn’t happened and Nvidia’s only gotten stronger. That’s not to say over time Nvidia won’t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it’s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution. Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations.

August is shaping up to be the worst month for stocks this year, with all three main averages closing last week lower after a hawkish read of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting sent equities lower and Treasury rates higher in the second half of the week. Economic data continues to come in stronger than expected, with the July retail sales report indicating a 0.7% increase in sales for the month, about double what economists forecast.

Qualcomm Approached Intel About a Takeover in Recent Days.csv,"Qualcomm recently approached Intel with a takeover proposal, marking what could be one of the largest tech deals in recent memory, according to sources. Intel, once valued at over $290 billion, has seen its market cap fall to around $90 billion after a challenging year in which its shares dropped 60%. While a deal is far from guaranteed, Qualcomm’s interest comes as Intel struggles to recover under CEO Pat Gelsinger’s turnaround plan, which has yet to deliver significant results. Should Intel be receptive, the deal could face heavy antitrust scrutiny, though some argue it might bolster U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor industry. Qualcomm may consider offloading parts of Intel to complete the acquisition. Both companies have sought to capitalize on the AI boom, though they’ve lagged behind Nvidia. Intel, grappling with factory delays and cost-cutting measures, is receiving government subsidies as part of its efforts to build chip factories. A Qualcomm takeover could enhance its portfolio by adding Intel’s dominance in PCs and servers to its smartphone chip business. Despite this potential merger, Intel continues to face major hurdles, including the possible need to split its design and manufacturing operations amid growing calls for the company to separate its business divisions.

Not exactly surprising to see these giants at the top of the list. The year is 2044... does the top eight look relatively similar to what it looks like now? Feels hard to argue otherwise.

Serious question from someone who took a four-year trading break.csv,Hey everyone After a long long hiatus and licking my wounds I decided to try trading once again. Recently I've been changing up my approach and doing 5-7 DTE spy options. And it's been going pretty decent however recently I got a couple of August 30th calls for Nvidia I managed to get in at a good position for 133 calls. My thesis is that it's going to keep pumping up to the day of earnings. I don't have any intention of holding the position up until expiration. My question is regarding theta decay and volatility. I know that the closer I got to the expiration the less profit I'll see as a percentage of my position. And I also understand that during high levels of volatility it can go both ways. And I'm not really asking for specific advice just kind of guidance or knowledge as to how that may affect my position. I'm holding them over the weekend and I'm expecting Monday to start off a little red but to finish off green and so I'm not quite sure if I want to sell half my positions and wait till earnings or if I should wait to earnings in general. I strongly believe that Nvidia is going to beat their earnings I just don't know how drastically that's going to affect the price action. Any and all input is definitely appreciated Thanks in advance,0.5421,NEGATIVE,0.9936

Super Micro Falls as Hindenburg Takes Aim With Short Report.csv,"Super Micro Computer Inc.'s shares took a hit on Tuesday following a short report from Hindenburg Research that questioned the company's financial practices and transparency. Hindenburg's report alleged significant accounting red flags, undisclosed related-party transactions, and potential violations of sanctions and export controls. Initially, the report caused Super Micro's stock to plummet by as much as 8.7%, but it later rebounded to close down 2.6%. The server manufacturer has been a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, with its high-performance servers in high demand for data centers. This surge in AI-related demand has driven significant growth for the company, doubling its revenue to $14.9 billion in the most recent fiscal year. Despite a steep decline from its March peak, Super Micro's stock remains up over 90% for the year, reflecting continued investor interest in the burgeoning AI sector. However, the Hindenburg report could intensify scrutiny on Super Micro's accounting practices and client relationships, particularly as the company has faced regulatory challenges in the past. In 2020, Super Micro resolved a U.S. SEC investigation by correcting its financial statements and paying a penalty for accounting issues from 2014 to 2017. As the AI market continues to expand, maintaining investor confidence will be crucial for Super Micro, especially amid concerns about the profitability of AI-optimized servers and the potential for increased regulatory oversight.

Technical Analysis Lesson - Reversal Day in Nvidia (NVDA).csv,"Every trader wants to know when the trend is changing from up to down or down to up. This happens when the leadership in the market changes from bulls to bears or bears to bulls. These trend changes are what every trader looks for. If they can accurately predict market turns, they can profit. That’s why they do what they do. Sometimes this change of leadership is slow and takes a long period of time to happen. These changes have price action that tends to show up on a chart as a ‘Rounded Top’ or ‘Rounded Bottom’ pattern. Sometimes the reversal is abrupt and takes place over a few time periods. This action tends to show up on a chart as a ‘V’ or ‘Inverted V’ reversal. But sometimes the trend changes just in one day... These dynamics can show up on a chart as a ‘Reversal Day’ pattern. One may have just happened in the stock of Nivida (NVDA). The Western world would call it an ‘Outside Reversal Day’. In candlestick terminology, it is called a ‘Bearish Engulfing Pattern’. It’s important to note that these candlestick patterns are at least 700 years old. They were developed by Japanese rice traders. It shows that the human nature which is illustrated in charts hasn’t changed. The name doesn’t matter. The action that it illustrates does. On Friday morning, it looked as though the uptrend in NVDA was going to continue for yet another day. It opened at a higher price than Thursday’s close. But then the tide turned… Over the day, the sellers came out of the woodwork. And not only did they hold off the assault. They overpowered the buyers and eventually pushed the price much lower. Importantly, Friday’s closing price was lower than Thursday’s opening price. This is frequently a characteristic of a trend that is reversing. Sometimes the change of leadership from bulls to bears happens over an extended time-period. But sometimes it occurs in just one day. That could be the case here.",0.5201,NEGATIVE,0.9938

TSM investment.csv,"Does anyone have any opinions on if this is a good investment? Given the recent AI boom everyone is focused on big players such as NVIDIA and AMD, but they are both supplied heavily by TSM for their chips. I don’t see much competition for TSM given they are so far advanced ahead of any American or Chinese competitor, and given the only increase in demand for AI technology, I don’t see how they wouldn’t grow. Yes the stock is expensive right now, but given the growth opportunity I would argue there is still plenty of room for expansion. Yes, China is a threat, but something tells me that China would not dare suffer the economic sanctions western nations would impose if they made a move in Taiwan. Trump has said he would likely put tariffs on the Taiwan semiconductor industry in order to grow domestic production, but still with tariffs, I don’t see big players switching to alternatives, as the gap between TSM and alternatives is very large.

TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand.csv,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

TSMC thoughts.csv,"TSMC went on a tear so far this year and they seem to be poised for higher growth since they are struggling to even meet demand for their chips right now. Along with main clients like NVIDIA and AMD and APPLE looked to work on AI. HPC revenue has growth i think 30% in their last 2 quarters. They are also mass producing 3nm chips which is starting to make up a nice chunk of their revenue. My main concern is obviously china but also that they are too tied to nvidia. Whenever i see them in the market, if NVIDIA is up 3%, they are up 6%, but if NVIDIA is down 3%, they are down 6-7%. Is it still a buy even though it has risen almost 50% this year?

Understand this about INTC.csv,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Why am I bullish on SFY instead of SPY.csv,"A comparison analysis between the holdings of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY), I have compiled information from the most recent available data. Below is a table showing the top 10 holdings for each ETF along with their percentage weight in the respective ETFs. This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings: Data Sources: SPY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Schwab, Yahoo Finance. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST) SFY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Zacks.com, Yahoo Finance. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST) Key Observations: Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting. It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation. I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors: Expense Ratio: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. Stock Selection Methodology: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. Performance Trends: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. Portfolio Diversification: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. Market Positioning: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. Innovative Approach of SoFi: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy. It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.

"Why Are Analysts Increasing NVIDIA’s Price Target Is It Out of Fear That Something Bad Will Happen, .csv","NVIDIA, often considered the heart of AI stocks, has recently been in the spotlight as analysts uniformly raise their stock targets. To me, this trend seems somewhat peculiar, even considering the current earnings season. The buoyant optimism surrounding the stock’s potential rise is sparking doubt in my mind. Should the stock underperform, it will be a litmus test of these analysts’ sincerity, raising questions about whether they may be manipulating public sentiment. In the broader context of the semiconductor sector, the recent quarterly earnings have been largely underwhelming. Yet, all semiconductor stocks appear to be buoyed by NVIDIA’s momentum. A stumble in NVIDIA’s stock could trigger a broader tech market downfall, while success could reignite a bullish trend for tech stocks. My intuition, however, leans towards a potential disappointment. NVIDIA might surpass current estimates but simultaneously lower their future guidance due to sluggish growth. Should this occur, a significant drop in stock price could follow. Disclaimer: These thoughts are purely my own observations and should not be taken as financial advice.",0.542,NEGATIVE,0.9983

Worse case scenario the perfect Bear cocktail.csv,"After reading all the comments from my last post and doing some more thinking. I decided to entertain the idea of what would be the perfect Bear cocktail that could trigger a Stock Market destabilization. I'm not taking into account any type of positive news. I'm simply going the negative route, in a slow and systematic manner, without any huge trigger events. What am I missing and at what dates that's important and could also add to this? If you notice in the prior post list, three out of six times... rising interest rates were part of the cause that brought the market down at least 20%. Oil price shocks two out of 6. Then there´s speculative investments at the dotcom bubble. Covid, overvaluation, trade tensions... Stagflation. So these have to be in the mix one way or another: Cocktail Potential Ingredients: Rising interest rates. Oil price shocks. Speculative tech investments. Overvaluation. Trade tensions. Stagflation. New round of Covid-19. Housing or Commercial Real Estate Bubble. So this is the speculative worse case scenario we could have without going as far as having a WWIII: February 13, 2024: CPI report comes in hot. S&P500 comes down 1.5%, some buy the tiny dip. February 15, 2024: Jobless claims rise. Doesn't alter the market but adds to the cocktail mix. February 16, 2024: A higher-than-expected PPI indicates increasing costs at the producer level, which can signal rising inflationary pressures. Producers might pass these higher costs onto consumers, leading to an increase in consumer prices and overall inflation. The Fed to consider tightening monetary policy more aggressively than previously anticipated to combat inflation. This could include raising interest rates or adjusting the pace of tapering asset purchases. Financial markets don't react negatively to a higher-than-expected PPI, as it they priced it in from the CPI report. February 21, 2024: Nvidia posts earnings, they actually do fine but investors realize that´s gonna be the ceiling for now so the stock falls 15%. Other tech stocks get stained by the fear, bringing the S&P500 2.5% lower. AI investment sentiments leans towards potentially speculative for now. March 12, 2024: February´s CPI report comes in hot again, causing Algorithmic trades to sell and bring down the S&P500 another 2%. March 19-20, 2024: FOMC Meeting gives subtext of potentially not bringing interest rates down yet. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterates emphasis on the central bank's commitment to combating inflation, even if it requires keeping interest rates high for an extended period. This brings down the market sentiment down and numbers another 1%. April 5, 2024: In a CNBC YouTube video report, experts delve into the complexities of the current commercial real estate (CRE) market. The rise of remote work led to a decreased demand for office spaces, the pandemic trained people to make purchases online, commercial real estate bubble starts to show symptoms of cracking up. April 10, 2024: CPI report is on ambiguous. Not up, not down. Anything could happen at this point. Aprils report will define what the FED will do and the next 6 months of stock market activity. Market loses .5% April 17, 2024: Tom Lee's bullish perspective has been challenged by the prior events and during an interview he mentions that this was the turmoil he had been expecting but sees the S&P500 going back to 5,200 points by the end of the year. Currently at 4,600... 7.5% below all time highs. May 1, 2024: FOMC Meeting leaves a bad taste in mouth. Jerome shifts narrative towards not lowering interests rates yet. Market falls another 2.5% on the bad sentiment. May 15, 2024: Situations in the Middle East, such as tensions in Gaza or Iran, could impact global oil supplies by affecting regional stability and energy infrastructure. Saudi Arabia, a key OPEC member, might alter its oil production strategy in response to shifts in global politics, economic pressures, or changes in energy demand. Actions perceived as irrational could stem from strategic decisions to protect national interests, influence oil prices, or respond to international events. S&P500 falls 0.5%. July 8, 2024: A new wave of Covid-19 actually breaks through the collective deceit of it being over because death rates rise significantly and word spreads out again from hospital staff that's it's getting real bad. Stock market reacts in a mixed manner. Amazon and tech companies go up a little, small caps enter another bad rout. S&P500 falls 1%. July 20, 2024: Numbers start to confirm a Stagflation situation actually taking place. A significant slowdown in economic growth, rising unemployment rates, declining consumer spending, and a contraction in manufacturing. Inflation pressures, coupled with tightening monetary policies aimed at controlling price levels, contribute to decreased economic activity.

AMD to acquire server builder ZT Systems for 49 billion in cash and stock.csv,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced on Monday its plans to acquire server manufacturer ZT Systems for $4.9 billion, as part of its strategy to bolster its portfolio of artificial intelligence (AI) chips and hardware, and to compete more effectively against Nvidia. The acquisition will be financed with 75% cash and the remaining in stock, leveraging AMD’s $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments reported in the second quarter. The rising demands of AI computing have necessitated the use of thousands of interconnected chips to achieve the required processing power, making the design and construction of server systems increasingly critical. This acquisition will enable AMD to enhance its capabilities in this area. According to AMD CEO Lisa Su, the addition of ZT Systems’ engineers will accelerate the company’s ability to test and deploy its latest AI GPUs on a scale required by major cloud computing companies like Microsoft. Although AMD plans to incorporate ZT Systems into its operations, it has no intention of competing directly in the server manufacturing market. Instead, the company plans to divest its server manufacturing business after the acquisition is finalized, with no discussions yet held with potential buyers. ZT Systems CEO Frank Zhang will join AMD, reporting to Forrest Norrod, AMD’s data center chief. The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2025, will see AMD retaining about 1,000 of ZT Systems' roughly 2,500 employees.

AMZN Earnings Preview- What to watch for tonight.csv,"Earnings from Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. will be crucial in guiding the Nasdaq 100 after a volatile period marked by extreme fluctuations. As the last megacaps to release results before Nvidia Corp. in August, these reports will set the tone for tech investors, particularly focusing on how artificial intelligence is driving growth in Amazon’s cloud-computing unit and boosting demand for Apple's next iPhone. The results will also provide valuable insights into the health of consumer spending, with Amazon shares already up about 25% this year. Amazon.com Inc. is set to release its Q2 earnings report after the market closes, with a conference call scheduled for 5:30 p.m. ET. Analysts project the company will report revenue of $148.8 billion, marking an 11% increase year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up from 65 cents in the same period last year. Amazon has guided for Q2 operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, signaling strong performance despite broader economic challenges. Key metrics expected by analysts include AWS revenue at nearly $26 billion, representing more than 17% year-over-year growth, and advertising revenue projected to reach $13 billion, a 21.7% increase from last year. The Stores segment, bolstered by events like Prime Day, is anticipated to show significant activity, while improvements in operating margins, especially in the North America segment, will be closely watched. Analysts also expect updates on AI initiatives and the overall capital expenditures for the year. Comments from analysts emphasize the importance of AI and cloud services for Amazon's future growth. Citi analysts, led by Ronald Josey, anticipate AWS revenue growth accelerated in Q2 due to generative AI tailwinds, while also predicting a beat in operating income thanks to improved retail efficiencies and strong advertising demand. Truist analyst Youssef Squali highlights Amazon's ability to gain share in global e-commerce and sees multiple growth vectors powering the company's continued expansion. Retail performance and consumer spending trends will be significant indicators, especially given mixed reports this earnings season. Analysts like Matt Stucky of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management note the importance of Amazon's retail margin expansion and its impact on profitability. Additionally, the potential for a surprise dividend announcement is a point of interest, as Amazon remains the last major tech company without a dividend program. Amazon's Q2 results will follow earnings reports from key competitors like Microsoft and Google, both of which had mixed receptions based on their cloud and AI performances. Wall Street's current focus is on tangible returns from AI investments, making Amazon's updates on its AI initiatives and AWS growth crucial for investor sentiment. The company's dominant position in the cloud market and ongoing efforts to enhance its e-commerce offerings will be under the microscope. Amazon saw its stock rise following a strong Q1 earnings report, showcasing impressive upside in both EPS and revenue. The standout metric was a significant 221% year-over-year increase in operating income to $15.31 billion, far surpassing the prior guidance of $8-12 billion. The company’s guidance for Q2 operating income of $10-14 billion also exceeded expectations. The Stores segment performed well, driven by successful shopping events like Amazon's Spring Deal Days in Europe and the first Big Spring Sale in Canada and the US. Faster delivery times, enhanced by regionalization efforts and cost-saving measures such as consolidating units into fewer boxes, boosted customer purchase frequency and overall spend. Additionally, Amazon is preparing for its 10th Prime Day event in July, which is expected to further drive sales. Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the highlight of the quarter, with a 17% growth in constant currency, an improvement from previous quarters. AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue business, with significant growth in both generative and non-generative AI workloads. The Advertising Services segment also showed robust growth, with a 24% increase in revenue to $11.82 billion, driven primarily by sponsored ads and early gains in Prime Video ads. Despite guiding Q2 revenue below consensus due to foreign exchange impacts, the strong performance in AWS and advertising has left investors optimistic.",0.5699,POSITIVE,0.9923

Some of it just recovered from 2022 to it's pre-2022 state, but Nvidia has 205% growth this year, which is crazy Index funds - the legendary S&P 500. Everyone says it's the most stable etc - but I've found other indexes with even better growth. SP500 usually have the 7-10% yearly return and last 5 years went up 56%, but for example the INDEX Vanguard Growth ETF went up 87% for the last 5 years - and it was also a steady growth, not a lucky spike during one period. What do you think, is it really smart to go with SP500 or are there other ones that are much better, even tho SP500 is so hyped by everyone? and if you agree - what other indexes with better return would you recommend? Leverage - I'm not familiar with how much can you leverage in stocks, but for people that invest in the top 10, which most likely will go up in the future, wouldn't be smarter to invest it with i.e 5x leverage, since the companies like Microsoft are stable, and eventually will grow? Stock Math - let's say I invest $10.000 in a stock and it declines -50%. I know have $5.000. If it goes up by 50%, do I get $7.500 or do I get my $10.000 back?

Shares of the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate have rallied more than 28% in 2024, far above the S&P 500′s 18% gain. The $1 trillion threshold was crossed just two days before the “Oracle of Omaha” turns 94 years old. The shares were up 0.8% to $696,502.02 on Wednesday, allowing it to top the $1 trillion mark, per FactSet. The milestone “is a testament to the firm’s financial strength and franchise value,” said Cathy Seifert, Berkshire analyst at CFRA Research. “This is significant at a time when Berkshire represents one of the few remaining conglomerates in existence today.” Unlike the six other companies in the trillion-dollar club (Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta), Berkshire is known for its old-economy focus as the owner of BNSF Railway, Geico Insurance and Dairy Queen.

Fundamentals behind a USA market drop this week & some positives.csv,"The problem areas in the USA: -------------------------- *- The Schiller PE is at a very high level. Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble. So stocks are highly expensive. *- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022! We are more of a service economy than a goods economy, *- World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle. That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local sales declines are offset. Additionally the trade war hampers both sides. *- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels. *- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers. You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term. People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank. However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials. AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth. AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales. So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia. This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW. I don't own any MKSI. This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording. So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN. Good areas: -------------------------------------- *- Labor productivity is up consistently since Q3 2022. one can see tradingeconomics dot com USA productivity *- Gasoline is lower than last year *- Retail sales are going fine, [ per a recent NPR radio article ] Nuetral ---------------------------------------- *- Labor force participation is not higher than Sept 2023. No more sales growth from people returning to work. Participation is up recently. tradingeconomics has this info. *- Consumer confidence is still down since January 2020.

Liz Ann Sonders, Chief Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab, pointed out that beneath the surface, the average stock in the Nasdaq has experienced a 37% drawdown, compared to the 7% maximum drawdown of the index from its year-to-date high.

HPE Undervalued Tech Giant on the Rise!.csv,"I'm excited to share some incredible updates and insights about Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) that could make it a standout investment opportunity in the tech space. Key Growth Points: Innovative Financial as a Service (IFaaS): HPE's IFaaS is experiencing explosive growth, with an annual revenue rate soaring at 39%. This innovative service model is quickly becoming a cornerstone of HPE's strategy, driving substantial recurring revenue. AI Systems Revenue: AI is the future, and HPE is at the forefront. Their AI systems revenue has more than doubled from Q1 to Q2, hitting an impressive $900 million. This rapid growth underscores HPE's strong positioning in the AI market. Massive AI Systems Orders: The cumulative orders for HPE’s AI systems have reached a staggering $4.6 billion, maintaining a robust double-digit quarterly growth pace. This is a clear indicator of the high demand and trust in HPE’s AI solutions. Cutting-Edge Liquid Cooling Technology: HPE holds over 300 patents in the area of direct liquid cooling. This technology is crucial for managing the power demands of accelerated compute silicon designs, making HPE a leader in sustainable and efficient computing solutions. Strategic Partnership with NVIDIA (NVDA): HPE's collaboration with NVIDIA enhances their AI capabilities and product offerings. This partnership further solidifies HPE's position in the high-performance computing and AI markets. Valuation Compared to Peers: Despite these impressive metrics, HPE is significantly undervalued. It’s trading at just 8 times revenue, compared to Dell’s 19 times. This discrepancy highlights a potential for substantial upside as the market recognizes HPE's value. Why HPE? HPE is not just another tech company; it's a powerhouse of innovation and growth. Their strategic focus on AI, IFaaS, and advanced cooling technologies is driving significant revenue increases and solidifying their market position. As the tech landscape evolves, HPE is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends and deliver outstanding returns to investors. Conclusion: HPE's growth story is compelling and their current undervaluation offers a unique investment opportunity. With a strong trajectory in AI, IFaaS, and liquid cooling technology, HPE is poised to deliver exceptional value. If you’re looking for a tech stock with solid fundamentals and growth potential, HPE should definitely be on your radar.",0.5592,POSITIVE,0.9995

"Impacting NVDA is underlying logic,what does OpenAI is change in strategy mean.csv","Big model pre-training bottleneck: Silicon Valley AI labs are generally struggling with new model training, with OpenAI's Orion and Google's Gemini 2.0 failing to significantly outperform their predecessors, defying the “law of scaling”. This law used to mean that model performance would continue to increase with data and computation, but the scaling effect has now plateaued. Computing in the reasoning phase: To overcome pre-training bottlenecks, OpenAI and other labs are exploring “compute on test” techniques that enable human-like multi-step reasoning by allowing models to generate and evaluate multiple possibilities in real-time during the reasoning phase. This approach can be used more effectively for complex tasks such as mathematics and coding to optimize reasoning performance. Hardware Demand Shift: Market demand is likely to shift from large-scale pre-training clusters to inference clouds as new technologies reduce parameter requirements. This will weaken NVIDIA's monopoly in the training chip market, and the inference chip market may see more competition, especially as companies such as Groq may fill the new demand. Capital Trends: Venture capital organizations are highly concerned about this change, and are gradually investing more resources in distributed inference clouds to cater to the distributed server needs of inference computing.",0.5346,POSITIVE,0.6048

Intel potential comeback.csv,"Hey! Intel seems like a company that's really struggling right now. Their stock just dropped to around $20.16, and it’s not just the GPU market giving them trouble. They’re battling issues on multiple fronts. First off, their foundry business (where they manufacture chips) is bleeding money – about $7 billion in annual losses! They’re not expected to break even there until at least 2027. On top of that, they’re losing market share to AMD and Nvidia, both in CPUs and GPUs. Nvidia is dominating with AI, and AMD is taking more and more of the gaming market. It also feels like they completely missed the whole AI boom. Nvidia is raking in insane profits, while Intel seems to be… just watching? And to make things worse, their CEO recently stepped down, which makes their future even more uncertain. That said, they’ve just launched their new Arc B580 and B570 budget GPUs. Nvidia and AMD seem more focused on AI and data centers right now, so maybe Intel has a shot at carving out a space in gaming? But is that really enough to turn things around? What do you guys think?

Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,NEGATIVE,0.9443

Hi! I’m Dan Howley, the tech editor at Yahoo Finance, and Nvidia has seemingly been at the forefront of virtually everything I’ve covered since ChatGPT hit the scene in 2022. I’ve been covering the tech space for 13 years and tracking Nvidia for even longer. I built my first desktop PC with an Nvidia graphics card in high school and have continued using its products ever since. Now I, like everyone else, am focused on Nvidia’s AI efforts, from reporting on how they’re dealing with the threat of increased competition to attending the company’s GTC conference to chatting with CEO Jensen Huang alongside my colleague Julie Hyman. With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia’s chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like AMD are gaining steam, and Nvidia’s own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant. How that plays out over the next few years is anyone’s guess. In today’s fiscal 2025 third quarter earnings report, Nvidia beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines on the strength of sales of its high-powered AI chips. 💵 Revenue: $35.08B vs $33.2B expected 💲 Adjusted EPS: $0.81 vs $0.74 expected 💾 Data center revenue: $30.8B vs $29B expected Nvidia also said it anticipates revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, for the fiscal fourth quarter.

Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&P 500 gains.csv,"= just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing = The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023 https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9 The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions. It’s an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve’s inflation battle, noted FactSet’s Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post. The 10 top performing days for the S&P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%. The S&P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday’s close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%. Through Dec. 22, the S&P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%. Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said. That didn’t mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote. Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found. Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July. The strategy “indicates the Fed’s measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,” Jakobsen said. The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks’ bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group’s announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering. SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a “mini” banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown. Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks — Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78% , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, 0.16%, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%, Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%, Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%, and Meta Platforms Inc. META, 0.56%. See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024? Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind. The S&P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted. In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high: The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&P 500’s weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted. Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&P 500’s overall return, he wrote, with the company’s success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.",0.5482,NEGATIVE,0.9995
Mega-caps vs small caps.csv,"The current state of the stock market exhibits a stark contrast between the performance of mega-cap and small-cap stocks, as investors grapple with mixed signals from major corporations and broader market indices.  Recent developments have highlighted this divide, with Microsoft's upcoming earnings report set to further shape the narrative. Mega-Cap Weakness and Market Impact Microsoft, a key player in the technology sector, is set to report its earnings after the market close, and its performance could significantly influence investor sentiment.  The recent underperformance of large-cap stocks like Merck and Procter & Gamble, both of which have disappointed with earnings guidance, has contributed to the Nasdaq Composite's (-0.9%) and S&P 500's (-0.4%) downward pressure.  This weakness is reflected in the Vanguard Mega-Cap Growth ETF (MGK), which is down 1.1%. Small-Cap Resilience In contrast, small-cap stocks have shown relative strength, with the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 Value Index posting gains.  The equal-weighted S&P 500 is also holding its own, indicating that smaller companies are providing a stabilizing force in the market.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, buoyed by the financials and energy sectors, adds to this resilience. Sectors in Focus The IT sector, weighed down by NVIDIA's (-5.0%) decline ahead of AMD's earnings release, is leading the pack of losers.  Consumer staples, also negatively impacted, are lagging behind. On the other hand, financials, and energy sectors are posting gains, offering a glimmer of hope for investors seeking opportunities. Treasuries and Market Sentiment The Treasury market remains relatively calm, with the 2-yr note yield down to 4.38% and the 10-yr note yield at 4.17%.  Economic indicators, such as the better-than-expected consumer confidence index and the Bank of Japan's policy decision, have not sparked significant market movements, suggesting that investors are cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's FOMC decision on Wednesday. As we await Microsoft's earnings report, the stock market's divide between mega-cap and small-cap stocks is a cause for concern, especially for those relying on large-cap performance.  However, the resilience of small-cap companies and select sectors is providing a silver lining. Investors should stay vigilant, monitor market reactions to key earnings releases, and consider a diversified portfolio that takes into account the current market dynamics.  The Federal Reserve's decision will likely play a crucial role in determining the market's next course of action.",0.5419,NEGATIVE,0.9136

MSFT faces long-term potential disadvantages.csv,"I think one of the main reasons Microsoft is a great long-term investment is its long history of generating a lot of free cash flow. At the time of writing, the company's free cash flow margin is over 30%, with free cash flow rising from $15.9 billion in 2009 to $74.1 billion in the last 12 months. This financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments. While Microsoft may not seem like a value investment, in my opinion, its pricing is reasonable given its continued revenue and earnings growth, and it's likely to continue for the foreseeable future. I estimate EPS growth of 13% on a regular basis over the next 12 months. Based on this projection, I have a price target of $482.40 and estimate that the stock will trade at a non-GAAP P/E ratio of around 36. Looking ahead, I expect Microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15% over the next 5 to 10 years. While this prospect necessitates buying the stock at a fair valuation, I believe the current price provides an opportunity. The company's forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is only 6.5% above its five-year average, while its forward diluted earnings per share growth rate is nearly the same at 5.8%. MSFT faces long-term potential headwinds One potential challenge to Microsoft's long-term growth in AI is that its adoption can be cyclical. Currently, the demand for AI systems is high, which has prompted Microsoft and other big tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion. However, when the current trend peaks (likely due to macroeconomic constraints), growth may slow. According to the TipRanks risk analysis tool, Microsoft is exposed to 32% risk from legal and regulatory factors, which is higher than the industry average and could impact its AI operations due to increased scrutiny of data privacy and AI governance. Given this outlook, I expect some volatility in Microsoft's long-term growth trajectory, although it may not be as good as NVIDIA NVDA -0.06% ▼ and so on semiconductor companies so obvious. As market sentiment fluctuates, cyclical price and valuation declines coincide with temporarily lower growth rates and may provide more attractive buying opportunities. There is also a risk that Microsoft and other Big Tech players could over-invest in AI infrastructure. With 21% of its risk related to Tech & Innovation, Microsoft’s heavy investment in AI-driven initiatives, including data center infrastructure, could result in lower-than-expected returns if industry growth does not meet expectations. This may impact free cash flow margins in the medium term, contributing to further volatility.",0.5607,NEGATIVE,0.8794

Nvidia announces 50 billion stock buyback.csv,"Nvidia said Wednesday that its board of directors has approved a $50 billion stock buyback. The computer chip giant announced the share repurchase as part of its fiscal second-quarter earnings, in which it reported earnings and guidance that surpassed Wall Street expectations. Nvidia returned $15.4 billion to shareholders in share repurposes and cash dividends as part of the company’s first half of its fiscal 2025. The company said it had $7.5 billion remaining under its share repurchase plan, as of the end of its fiscal second quarter. Last year, Nvidia announced a $25 billion share buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results. Companies often experience a boom to their stock price after revealing stock buyback plans. In May, for instance, Apple announced a $110 billion stock buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results that showed overall sales fell 4% year over year and iPhone sales dropped 10% year over year. However, the iPhone maker’s shares rose 7% in after-hours trading, likely because Apple’s share buyback was the biggest in corporate history. With Nvidia’s shares dropping 4% in extended trading despite reporting solid financial results and announcing a stock buyback, some experts believe the company has been doing so well that it is getting harder to impress investors.

Nvidia More Room to Run Just Getting Started.csv,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they’ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don’t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical. Yes, Nvidia’s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn’t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now. Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn’t possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia’s place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn’t happened and Nvidia’s only gotten stronger. That’s not to say over time Nvidia won’t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it’s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution. Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations.

Powell's comments on interest rates, the economy, and any indication that inflationary pressures are driving a reassessment of the Fed's present aims will be scrutinized.

Lowe's, BJ's Wholesale Club, and Peloton are also set to announce earnings this week. August is shaping up to be the worst month for stocks this year, with all three main averages closing last week lower after a hawkish read of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting sent equities lower and Treasury rates higher in the second half of the week. Economic data continues to come in stronger than expected, with the July retail sales report indicating a 0.7% increase in sales for the month, about double what economists forecast. The AtlantaFed's GDPNow projection now predicts third-quarter GDP growth of 5.8%, the strongest rate since the fourth quarter of 2021.

Qualcomm Approached Intel About a Takeover in Recent Days.csv,"Qualcomm recently approached Intel with a takeover proposal, marking what could be one of the largest tech deals in recent memory, according to sources. Intel, once valued at over $290 billion, has seen its market cap fall to around $90 billion after a challenging year in which its shares dropped 60%. While a deal is far from guaranteed, Qualcomm’s interest comes as Intel struggles to recover under CEO Pat Gelsinger’s turnaround plan, which has yet to deliver significant results. Should Intel be receptive, the deal could face heavy antitrust scrutiny, though some argue it might bolster U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor industry. Qualcomm may consider offloading parts of Intel to complete the acquisition. Both companies have sought to capitalize on the AI boom, though they’ve lagged behind Nvidia. Intel, grappling with factory delays and cost-cutting measures, is receiving government subsidies as part of its efforts to build chip factories. A Qualcomm takeover could enhance its portfolio by adding Intel’s dominance in PCs and servers to its smartphone chip business. Despite this potential merger, Intel continues to face major hurdles, including the possible need to split its design and manufacturing operations amid growing calls for the company to separate its business divisions.

RYCEY do you believe in this company.csv,"Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC (LSE:RR.) shares have risen three-fold in little more than a year, but there is still a bit more to go according to Citigroup, which has raised its share price target to 555p. “Positive sentiment will help the continued rerating, driven by accelerating wide body cycle (only a few delivery slots before 2030 for the A350 and 2028 for the A330),” said the bank.

S&P 20 years ago versus today Via @alerts on IG.csv,2004: Walmart ExxonMobil Chevron Citi IBM General Electric GM Ford 2024: Microsoft (7.84%) Apple (6.83%) Nvidia (3.8%) Alphabet (3.72%) Amazon (3.5%) Meta (2.1%) Berkshire Hathaway (1.71%) Broadcom (1.28%) Interesting to see the discrepancies and differences in the top eight from 2004 compared to the top eight from 2024. Not exactly surprising to see these giants at the top of the list. The year is 2044... does the top eight look relatively similar to what it looks like now? Feels hard to argue otherwise. Then again they probably said similar things in 2004. It just seems like GAFAM will continue to purchase any successful companies of smaller size.

Serious question from someone who took a four-year trading break.csv,Hey everyone After a long long hiatus and licking my wounds I decided to try trading once again. Recently I've been changing up my approach and doing 5-7 DTE spy options. And it's been going pretty decent however recently I got a couple of August 30th calls for Nvidia I managed to get in at a good position for 133 calls. My thesis is that it's going to keep pumping up to the day of earnings. I don't have any intention of holding the position up until expiration. My question is regarding theta decay and volatility. I know that the closer I got to the expiration the less profit I'll see as a percentage of my position. And I also understand that during high levels of volatility it can go both ways. And I'm not really asking for specific advice just kind of guidance or knowledge as to how that may affect my position. I'm holding them over the weekend and I'm expecting Monday to start off a little red but to finish off green and so I'm not quite sure if I want to sell half my positions and wait till earnings or if I should wait to earnings in general. I strongly believe that Nvidia is going to beat their earnings I just don't know how drastically that's going to affect the price action. Any and all input is definitely appreciated Thanks in advance,0.5421,NEGATIVE,0.9936

Super Micro Falls as Hindenburg Takes Aim With Short Report.csv,"Super Micro Computer Inc.'s shares took a hit on Tuesday following a short report from Hindenburg Research that questioned the company's financial practices and transparency. Hindenburg's report alleged significant accounting red flags, undisclosed related-party transactions, and potential violations of sanctions and export controls. Initially, the report caused Super Micro's stock to plummet by as much as 8.7%, but it later rebounded to close down 2.6%. The server manufacturer has been a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, with its high-performance servers in high demand for data centers. This surge in AI-related demand has driven significant growth for the company, doubling its revenue to $14.9 billion in the most recent fiscal year. Despite a steep decline from its March peak, Super Micro's stock remains up over 90% for the year, reflecting continued investor interest in the burgeoning AI sector. However, the Hindenburg report could intensify scrutiny on Super Micro's accounting practices and client relationships, particularly as the company has faced regulatory challenges in the past. In 2020, Super Micro resolved a U.S. SEC investigation by correcting its financial statements and paying a penalty for accounting issues from 2014 to 2017. As the AI market continues to expand, maintaining investor confidence will be crucial for Super Micro, especially amid concerns about the profitability of AI-optimized servers and the potential for increased regulatory oversight.

Technical Analysis Lesson - Reversal Day in Nvidia (NVDA).csv,"Every trader wants to know when the trend is changing from up to down or down to up. This happens when the leadership in the market changes from bulls to bears or bears to bulls. These trend changes are what every trader looks for. If they can accurately predict market turns, they can profit. That’s why they do what they do. Sometimes this change of leadership is slow and takes a long period of time to happen. These changes have price action that tends to show up on a chart as a ‘Rounded Top’ or ‘Rounded Bottom’ pattern. Sometimes the reversal is abrupt and takes place over a few time periods. This action tends to show up on a chart as a ‘V’ or ‘Inverted V’ reversal. But sometimes the trend changes just in one day... These dynamics can show up on a chart as a ‘Reversal Day’ pattern. One may have just happened in the stock of Nivida (NVDA). The Western world would call it an ‘Outside Reversal Day’. In candlestick terminology, it is called a ‘Bearish Engulfing Pattern’. It’s important to note that these candlestick patterns are at least 700 years old. They were developed by Japanese rice traders. It shows that the human nature which is illustrated in charts hasn’t changed. The name doesn’t matter. The action that it illustrates does. On Friday morning, it looked as though the uptrend in NVDA was going to continue for yet another day. It opened at a higher price than Thursday’s close. But then the tide turned… Over the day, the sellers came out of the woodwork. And not only did they hold off the assault. They overpowered the buyers and eventually pushed the price much lower. Importantly, Friday’s closing price was lower than Thursday’s opening price. This is frequently a characteristic of a trend that is reversing. Sometimes the change of leadership from bulls to bears happens over an extended time-period. But sometimes it occurs in just one day. That could be the case here.",0.5201,NEGATIVE,0.9938

TSM investment.csv,"Does anyone have any opinions on if this is a good investment? Given the recent AI boom everyone is focused on big players such as NVIDIA and AMD, but they are both supplied heavily by TSM for their chips. I don’t see much competition for TSM given they are so far advanced ahead of any American or Chinese competitor, and given the only increase in demand for AI technology, I don’t see how they wouldn’t grow. Yes the stock is expensive right now, but given the growth opportunity I would argue there is still plenty of room for expansion. Yes, China is a threat, but something tells me that China would not dare suffer the economic sanctions western nations would impose if they made a move in Taiwan. Trump has said he would likely put tariffs on the Taiwan semiconductor industry in order to grow domestic production, but still with tariffs, I don’t see big players switching to alternatives, as the gap between TSM and alternatives is very large.

TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand.csv,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

TSMC thoughts.csv,"TSMC went on a tear so far this year and they seem to be poised for higher growth since they are struggling to even meet demand for their chips right now. Along with main clients like NVIDIA and AMD and APPLE looked to work on AI. HPC revenue has growth i think 30% in their last 2 quarters. They are also mass producing 3nm chips which is starting to make up a nice chunk of their revenue. My main concern is obviously china but also that they are too tied to nvidia. Whenever i see them in the market, if NVIDIA is up 3%, they are up 6%, but if NVIDIA is down 3%, they are down 6-7%. Is it still a buy even though it has risen almost 50% this year?

Understand this about INTC.csv,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Why am I bullish on SFY instead of SPY.csv,"A comparison analysis between the holdings of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY), I have compiled information from the most recent available data. Below is a table showing the top 10 holdings for each ETF along with their percentage weight in the respective ETFs. This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings: Data Sources: SPY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Schwab, Yahoo Finance. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST) SFY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Zacks.com, Yahoo Finance. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST) Key Observations: Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting. It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation. I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors: Expense Ratio: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. Stock Selection Methodology: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. Performance Trends: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. Portfolio Diversification: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. Market Positioning: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. Innovative Approach of SoFi: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy. It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.

In the broader context of the semiconductor sector, the recent quarterly earnings have been largely underwhelming. Yet, all semiconductor stocks appear to be buoyed by NVIDIA’s momentum. A stumble in NVIDIA’s stock could trigger a broader tech market downfall, while success could reignite a bullish trend for tech stocks. My intuition, however, leans towards a potential disappointment. NVIDIA might surpass current estimates but simultaneously lower their future guidance due to sluggish growth. Should this occur, a significant drop in stock price could follow. Disclaimer: These thoughts are purely my own observations and should not be taken as financial advice.",0.542,NEGATIVE,0.9983

Gaming boom: Starting in the 2000s, technology entered the mass market, and the gaming industry began growing. It continues to grow today, and to play a high-quality video game, you would need an NVIDIA video card. Cryp* boom: This started in the early 2010s and continues to this day.

Worse case scenario the perfect Bear cocktail.csv,"After reading all the comments from my last post and doing some more thinking. I decided to entertain the idea of what would be the perfect Bear cocktail that could trigger a Stock Market destabilization. I'm not taking into account any type of positive news. I'm simply going the negative route, in a slow and systematic manner, without any huge trigger events. What am I missing and at what dates that's important and could also add to this? If you notice in the prior post list, three out of six times... rising interest rates were part of the cause that brought the market down at least 20%. Oil price shocks two out of 6. Then there´s speculative investments at the dotcom bubble. Covid, overvaluation, trade tensions... Stagflation. So these have to be in the mix one way or another: Cocktail Potential Ingredients: Rising interest rates. Oil price shocks. Speculative tech investments. Overvaluation. Trade tensions. Stagflation. New round of Covid-19. Housing or Commercial Real Estate Bubble. So this is the speculative worse case scenario we could have without going as far as having a WWIII: February 13, 2024: CPI report comes in hot. S&P500 comes down 1.5%, some buy the tiny dip. February 15, 2024: Jobless claims rise. Doesn't alter the market but adds to the cocktail mix. February 16, 2024: A higher-than-expected PPI indicates increasing costs at the producer level, which can signal rising inflationary pressures. Producers might pass these higher costs onto consumers, leading to an increase in consumer prices and overall inflation. The Fed to consider tightening monetary policy more aggressively than previously anticipated to combat inflation. This could include raising interest rates or adjusting the pace of tapering asset purchases. Financial markets don't react negatively to a higher-than-expected PPI, as it they priced it in from the CPI report. February 21, 2024: Nvidia posts earnings, they actually do fine but investors realize that´s gonna be the ceiling for now so the stock falls 15%. Other tech stocks get stained by the fear, bringing the S&P500 2.5% lower. AI investment sentiments leans towards potentially speculative for now. March 12, 2024: February´s CPI report comes in hot again, causing Algorithmic trades to sell and bring down the S&P500 another 2%. March 19-20, 2024: FOMC Meeting gives subtext of potentially not bringing interest rates down yet. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterates emphasis on the central bank's commitment to combating inflation, even if it requires keeping interest rates high for an extended period. This brings down the market sentiment down and numbers another 1%. April 5, 2024: In a CNBC YouTube video report, experts delve into the complexities of the current commercial real estate (CRE) market. The rise of remote work led to a decreased demand for office spaces, the pandemic trained people to make purchases online, commercial real estate bubble starts to show symptoms of cracking up. April 10, 2024: CPI report is on ambiguous. Not up, not down. Anything could happen at this point. Aprils report will define what the FED will do and the next 6 months of stock market activity. Market loses .5% April 17, 2024: Tom Lee's bullish perspective has been challenged by the prior events and during an interview he mentions that this was the turmoil he had been expecting but sees the S&P500 going back to 5,200 points by the end of the year. Currently at 4,600... 7.5% below all time highs. May 1, 2024: FOMC Meeting leaves a bad taste in mouth. Jerome shifts narrative towards not lowering interests rates yet. Market falls another 2.5% on the bad sentiment. May 15, 2024: Situations in the Middle East, such as tensions in Gaza or Iran, could impact global oil supplies by affecting regional stability and energy infrastructure. Saudi Arabia, a key OPEC member, might alter its oil production strategy in response to shifts in global politics, economic pressures, or changes in energy demand. Actions perceived as irrational could stem from strategic decisions to protect national interests, influence oil prices, or respond to international events. S&P500 falls 0.5%. July 8, 2024: A new wave of Covid-19 actually breaks through the collective deceit of it being over because death rates rise significantly and word spreads out again from hospital staff that's it's getting real bad. Stock market reacts in a mixed manner. Amazon and tech companies go up a little, small caps enter another bad rout. S&P500 falls 1%. July 20, 2024: Numbers start to confirm a Stagflation situation actually taking place. A significant slowdown in economic growth, rising unemployment rates, declining consumer spending, and a contraction in manufacturing. Inflation pressures, coupled with tightening monetary policies aimed at controlling price levels, contribute to decreased economic activity. Additionally, geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions serve as catalysts, further straining global markets. The interconnectedness of these factors in precipitate a recessionary environment. S&P500 falls .7%. July 23, 2024: Nvidia reports and disappoints, falls another 8% in tandem with other tech companies. July 25, 2024: Commercial Real Estate bubble pops and hits the news hard. S&P500 falls 1.4% At 13.6% the all time highs from January 2024. Currently at 4,400 points. August 14, 2024: After all the earnings reports it becomes increasingly clear: the FED won't lower rates and will keep them there for longer than expected; consumer spending is declining, companies keep firing people, the Bear narrative takes over.

AMD to acquire server builder ZT Systems for 49 billion in cash and stock.csv,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced on Monday its plans to acquire server manufacturer ZT Systems for $4.9 billion, as part of its strategy to bolster its portfolio of artificial intelligence (AI) chips and hardware, and to compete more effectively against Nvidia. The acquisition will be financed with 75% cash and the remaining in stock, leveraging AMD’s $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments reported in the second quarter. The rising demands of AI computing have necessitated the use of thousands of interconnected chips to achieve the required processing power, making the design and construction of server systems increasingly critical. This acquisition will enable AMD to enhance its capabilities in this area. According to AMD CEO Lisa Su, the addition of ZT Systems’ engineers will accelerate the company’s ability to test and deploy its latest AI GPUs on a scale required by major cloud computing companies like Microsoft. Although AMD plans to incorporate ZT Systems into its operations, it has no intention of competing directly in the server manufacturing market. Instead, the company plans to divest its server manufacturing business after the acquisition is finalized, with no discussions yet held with potential buyers. ZT Systems CEO Frank Zhang will join AMD, reporting to Forrest Norrod, AMD’s data center chief. The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2025, will see AMD retaining about 1,000 of ZT Systems' roughly 2,500 employees.

AMZN Earnings Preview- What to watch for tonight.csv,"Earnings from Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. will be crucial in guiding the Nasdaq 100 after a volatile period marked by extreme fluctuations. As the last megacaps to release results before Nvidia Corp. in August, these reports will set the tone for tech investors, particularly focusing on how artificial intelligence is driving growth in Amazon’s cloud-computing unit and boosting demand for Apple's next iPhone. The results will also provide valuable insights into the health of consumer spending, with Amazon shares already up about 25% this year. Amazon.com Inc. is set to release its Q2 earnings report after the market closes, with a conference call scheduled for 5:30 p.m. ET. Analysts project the company will report revenue of $148.8 billion, marking an 11% increase year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up from 65 cents in the same period last year. Amazon has guided for Q2 operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, signaling strong performance despite broader economic challenges. Key metrics expected by analysts include AWS revenue at nearly $26 billion, representing more than 17% year-over-year growth, and advertising revenue projected to reach $13 billion, a 21.7% increase from last year. The Stores segment, bolstered by events like Prime Day, is anticipated to show significant activity, while improvements in operating margins, especially in the North America segment, will be closely watched. Analysts also expect updates on AI initiatives and the overall capital expenditures for the year. Comments from analysts emphasize the importance of AI and cloud services for Amazon's future growth. Citi analysts, led by Ronald Josey, anticipate AWS revenue growth accelerated in Q2 due to generative AI tailwinds, while also predicting a beat in operating income thanks to improved retail efficiencies and strong advertising demand. Truist analyst Youssef Squali highlights Amazon's ability to gain share in global e-commerce and sees multiple growth vectors powering the company's continued expansion. Retail performance and consumer spending trends will be significant indicators, especially given mixed reports this earnings season. Analysts like Matt Stucky of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management note the importance of Amazon's retail margin expansion and its impact on profitability. Additionally, the potential for a surprise dividend announcement is a point of interest, as Amazon remains the last major tech company without a dividend program. Amazon's Q2 results will follow earnings reports from key competitors like Microsoft and Google, both of which had mixed receptions based on their cloud and AI performances. Wall Street's current focus is on tangible returns from AI investments, making Amazon's updates on its AI initiatives and AWS growth crucial for investor sentiment. The company's dominant position in the cloud market and ongoing efforts to enhance its e-commerce offerings will be under the microscope. Amazon saw its stock rise following a strong Q1 earnings report, showcasing impressive upside in both EPS and revenue. The standout metric was a significant 221% year-over-year increase in operating income to $15.31 billion, far surpassing the prior guidance of $8-12 billion. The company’s guidance for Q2 operating income of $10-14 billion also exceeded expectations. The Stores segment performed well, driven by successful shopping events like Amazon's Spring Deal Days in Europe and the first Big Spring Sale in Canada and the US. Faster delivery times, enhanced by regionalization efforts and cost-saving measures such as consolidating units into fewer boxes, boosted customer purchase frequency and overall spend. Additionally, Amazon is preparing for its 10th Prime Day event in July, which is expected to further drive sales. Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the highlight of the quarter, with a 17% growth in constant currency, an improvement from previous quarters. AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue business, with significant growth in both generative and non-generative AI workloads. The Advertising Services segment also showed robust growth, with a 24% increase in revenue to $11.82 billion, driven primarily by sponsored ads and early gains in Prime Video ads. Despite guiding Q2 revenue below consensus due to foreign exchange impacts, the strong performance in AWS and advertising has left investors optimistic.",0.5699,POSITIVE,0.9923

Some of it just recovered from 2022 to it's pre-2022 state, but Nvidia has 205% growth this year, which is crazy Index funds - the legendary S&P 500. Everyone says it's the most stable etc - but I've found other indexes with even better growth. SP500 usually have the 7-10% yearly return and last 5 years went up 56%, but for example the INDEX Vanguard Growth ETF went up 87% for the last 5 years - and it was also a steady growth, not a lucky spike during one period. What do you think, is it really smart to go with SP500 or are there other ones that are much better, even tho SP500 is so hyped by everyone? and if you agree - what other indexes with better return would you recommend? Leverage - I'm not familiar with how much can you leverage in stocks, but for people that invest in the top 10, which most likely will go up in the future, wouldn't be smarter to invest it with i.e 5x leverage, since the companies like Microsoft are stable, and eventually will grow? Stock Math - let's say I invest $10.000 in a stock and it declines -50%. I know have $5.000. If it goes up by 50%, do I get $7.500 or do I get my $10.000 back?

The milestone “is a testament to the firm’s financial strength and franchise value,” said Cathy Seifert, Berkshire analyst at CFRA Research. “This is significant at a time when Berkshire represents one of the few remaining conglomerates in existence today.” Unlike the six other companies in the trillion-dollar club (Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta), Berkshire is known for its old-economy focus as the owner of BNSF Railway, Geico Insurance and Dairy Queen.

Cramer's wishing for stock splits to make these big players more accessible to the everyday investor, aka the ""home gamer."" He's also got a bone to pick with the bearish analysts and media raining on the parade. Cramer's tackling concerns about Amazon Web Services slowing down, but he's not losing sleep over it.

Fundamentals behind a USA market drop this week & some positives.csv,"The problem areas in the USA: -------------------------- *- The Schiller PE is at a very high level. Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble. So stocks are highly expensive. *- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022! We are more of a service economy than a goods economy, *- World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle. That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local sales declines are offset. Additionally the trade war hampers both sides. *- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels. *- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers. You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term. People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank. However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials. AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth. AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales. So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia. This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW. I don't own any MKSI. This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording. So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN. Good areas: -------------------------------------- *- Labor productivity is up consistently since Q3 2022. one can see tradingeconomics dot com USA productivity *- Gasoline is lower than last year *- Retail sales are going fine, [ per a recent NPR radio article ] Nuetral ---------------------------------------- *- Labor force participation is not higher than Sept 2023. No more sales growth from people returning to work. Participation is up recently. tradingeconomics has this info. *- Consumer confidence is still down since January 2020.

"Impacting NVDA is underlying logic,what does OpenAI is change in strategy mean.csv","Big model pre-training bottleneck: Silicon Valley AI labs are generally struggling with new model training, with OpenAI's Orion and Google's Gemini 2.0 failing to significantly outperform their predecessors, defying the “law of scaling”. This law used to mean that model performance would continue to increase with data and computation, but the scaling effect has now plateaued. Computing in the reasoning phase: To overcome pre-training bottlenecks, OpenAI and other labs are exploring “compute on test” techniques that enable human-like multi-step reasoning by allowing models to generate and evaluate multiple possibilities in real-time during the reasoning phase. This approach can be used more effectively for complex tasks such as mathematics and coding to optimize reasoning performance. Hardware Demand Shift: Market demand is likely to shift from large-scale pre-training clusters to inference clouds as new technologies reduce parameter requirements. This will weaken NVIDIA's monopoly in the training chip market, and the inference chip market may see more competition, especially as companies such as Groq may fill the new demand.

Intel Corporation INTC’s Latest Strides and Challenges.csv,"Key Takeaways: Innovation and expansion in new tech frontiers are key growth drivers. Long-term outlook hinges on successful execution of strategic initiatives. Intel unveils new AI chip to compete with Nvidia and AMD Intel’s total revenue in Q3 2023 was $14.2 billion, marking an 8% decrease from Q3 2022. Company Overview: Intel Corporation, a global technology leader, has been at the forefront of innovation in the semiconductor industry. Founded in 1968, Intel’s contributions have been pivotal in the evolution of computing technologies. The company specializes in manufacturing microprocessors, chipsets, embedded processors, and network interface controllers, among others. Intel’s Strategic Pivot Amidst Market Flux Recent times have been a mix of challenges and opportunities for Intel. The company, once the undisputed leader in semiconductor technology, faces fierce competition from rivals like AMD and NVIDIA, who have made significant inroads into Intel’s market share. The rise of ARM-based processors and the increasing demand for specialized chips for AI and data centers add to the competitive pressure. Intel’s response to these challenges has been multi-pronged. The company has accelerated its innovation cycle, focusing on next-generation chip technologies. Under the leadership of CEO Pat Gelsinger, Intel announced a significant investment in expanding its manufacturing capabilities, aiming to not only meet its own chip demands but also offer foundry services to other chipmakers. Moreover, Intel is actively diversifying its product portfolio. Its recent advancements in AI, edge computing, and autonomous driving technologies signify a strategic shift.  Leading AI models, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, predominantly utilize Nvidia GPUs hosted in cloud environments. This reliance has contributed to Nvidia’s stock soaring by approximately 230% since the beginning of the year, in stark contrast to Intel’s 68% increase. This trend underlines why competitors like AMD and Intel are now introducing their own chips, aiming to challenge Nvidia’s strong market presence. Although specifics were sparse, Intel’s Gaudi3 is set to rival Nvidia’s H100, a popular choice for entities constructing extensive chip networks for AI operations, and AMD’s upcoming MI300X. The Gaudi3 is expected to begin distribution to clients in 2024. However, these strategic decisions come with their own set of risks. The high cost of chip manufacturing and R&D, coupled with the uncertain global economic landscape, poses significant challenges. The company’s ability to execute its ambitious plans while maintaining financial stability is a key factor to watch in the coming years. Recent Financials: Intel Corporation’s recent financial performance reflects the challenges and resilience of a tech giant in a volatile market.

Intel potential comeback.csv,"Hey! Intel seems like a company that's really struggling right now. Their stock just dropped to around $20.16, and it’s not just the GPU market giving them trouble. They’re battling issues on multiple fronts. First off, their foundry business (where they manufacture chips) is bleeding money – about $7 billion in annual losses! They’re not expected to break even there until at least 2027. On top of that, they’re losing market share to AMD and Nvidia, both in CPUs and GPUs. Nvidia is dominating with AI, and AMD is taking more and more of the gaming market. It also feels like they completely missed the whole AI boom. Nvidia is raking in insane profits, while Intel seems to be… just watching? And to make things worse, their CEO recently stepped down, which makes their future even more uncertain. That said, they’ve just launched their new Arc B580 and B570 budget GPUs. Nvidia and AMD seem more focused on AI and data centers right now, so maybe Intel has a shot at carving out a space in gaming? But is that really enough to turn things around? What do you guys think?

Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,NEGATIVE,0.9443

Hi! I’m Dan Howley, the tech editor at Yahoo Finance, and Nvidia has seemingly been at the forefront of virtually everything I’ve covered since ChatGPT hit the scene in 2022. I’ve been covering the tech space for 13 years and tracking Nvidia for even longer. I built my first desktop PC with an Nvidia graphics card in high school and have continued using its products ever since. Now I, like everyone else, am focused on Nvidia’s AI efforts, from reporting on how they’re dealing with the threat of increased competition to attending the company’s GTC conference to chatting with CEO Jensen Huang alongside my colleague Julie Hyman. With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia’s chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like AMD are gaining steam, and Nvidia’s own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant. How that plays out over the next few years is anyone’s guess. In today’s fiscal 2025 third quarter earnings report, Nvidia beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines on the strength of sales of its high-powered AI chips. 💵 Revenue: $35.08B vs $33.2B expected 💲 Adjusted EPS: $0.81 vs $0.74 expected 💾 Data center revenue: $30.8B vs $29B expected Nvidia also said it anticipates revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, for the fiscal fourth quarter.

Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&P 500 gains.csv,"= just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing = The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023 https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9 The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions. It’s an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve’s inflation battle, noted FactSet’s Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post. The 10 top performing days for the S&P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%. The S&P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday’s close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%. Through Dec. 22, the S&P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%. Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said. That didn’t mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote. Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found. Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July. The strategy “indicates the Fed’s measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,” Jakobsen said. The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks’ bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group’s announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering. SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a “mini” banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown. Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks — Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78% , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, 0.16%, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%, Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%, Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%, and Meta Platforms Inc. META, 0.56%. See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024? Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind. The S&P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted. In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high: The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&P 500’s weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted. Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&P 500’s overall return, he wrote, with the company’s success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.",0.5482,NEGATIVE,0.9995
Mega-caps vs small caps.csv,"The current state of the stock market exhibits a stark contrast between the performance of mega-cap and small-cap stocks, as investors grapple with mixed signals from major corporations and broader market indices.  Recent developments have highlighted this divide, with Microsoft's upcoming earnings report set to further shape the narrative. Mega-Cap Weakness and Market Impact Microsoft, a key player in the technology sector, is set to report its earnings after the market close, and its performance could significantly influence investor sentiment.  The recent underperformance of large-cap stocks like Merck and Procter & Gamble, both of which have disappointed with earnings guidance, has contributed to the Nasdaq Composite's (-0.9%) and S&P 500's (-0.4%) downward pressure.  This weakness is reflected in the Vanguard Mega-Cap Growth ETF (MGK), which is down 1.1%. Small-Cap Resilience In contrast, small-cap stocks have shown relative strength, with the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 Value Index posting gains.  The equal-weighted S&P 500 is also holding its own, indicating that smaller companies are providing a stabilizing force in the market.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, buoyed by the financials and energy sectors, adds to this resilience. Sectors in Focus The IT sector, weighed down by NVIDIA's (-5.0%) decline ahead of AMD's earnings release, is leading the pack of losers.  Consumer staples, also negatively impacted, are lagging behind. On the other hand, financials, and energy sectors are posting gains, offering a glimmer of hope for investors seeking opportunities. Treasuries and Market Sentiment The Treasury market remains relatively calm, with the 2-yr note yield down to 4.38% and the 10-yr note yield at 4.17%.  Economic indicators, such as the better-than-expected consumer confidence index and the Bank of Japan's policy decision, have not sparked significant market movements, suggesting that investors are cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's FOMC decision on Wednesday. As we await Microsoft's earnings report, the stock market's divide between mega-cap and small-cap stocks is a cause for concern, especially for those relying on large-cap performance.  However, the resilience of small-cap companies and select sectors is providing a silver lining. Investors should stay vigilant, monitor market reactions to key earnings releases, and consider a diversified portfolio that takes into account the current market dynamics.  The Federal Reserve's decision will likely play a crucial role in determining the market's next course of action.",0.5419,NEGATIVE,0.9136

MSFT faces long-term potential disadvantages.csv,"I think one of the main reasons Microsoft is a great long-term investment is its long history of generating a lot of free cash flow. At the time of writing, the company's free cash flow margin is over 30%, with free cash flow rising from $15.9 billion in 2009 to $74.1 billion in the last 12 months. This financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments. While Microsoft may not seem like a value investment, in my opinion, its pricing is reasonable given its continued revenue and earnings growth, and it's likely to continue for the foreseeable future. I estimate EPS growth of 13% on a regular basis over the next 12 months. Based on this projection, I have a price target of $482.40 and estimate that the stock will trade at a non-GAAP P/E ratio of around 36. Looking ahead, I expect Microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15% over the next 5 to 10 years. While this prospect necessitates buying the stock at a fair valuation, I believe the current price provides an opportunity. The company's forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is only 6.5% above its five-year average, while its forward diluted earnings per share growth rate is nearly the same at 5.8%. MSFT faces long-term potential headwinds One potential challenge to Microsoft's long-term growth in AI is that its adoption can be cyclical. Currently, the demand for AI systems is high, which has prompted Microsoft and other big tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion. However, when the current trend peaks (likely due to macroeconomic constraints), growth may slow. According to the TipRanks risk analysis tool, Microsoft is exposed to 32% risk from legal and regulatory factors, which is higher than the industry average and could impact its AI operations due to increased scrutiny of data privacy and AI governance. Given this outlook, I expect some volatility in Microsoft's long-term growth trajectory, although it may not be as good as NVIDIA NVDA -0.06% ▼ and so on semiconductor companies so obvious. As market sentiment fluctuates, cyclical price and valuation declines coincide with temporarily lower growth rates and may provide more attractive buying opportunities. There is also a risk that Microsoft and other Big Tech players could over-invest in AI infrastructure.

The demand for its AI GPUs remains high, the company has been receiving upward revisions recently, and its stock is trading around its all-time high levels with a potential to appreciate even further in the upcoming months.

Nvidia announces 50 billion stock buyback.csv,"Nvidia said Wednesday that its board of directors has approved a $50 billion stock buyback. The computer chip giant announced the share repurchase as part of its fiscal second-quarter earnings, in which it reported earnings and guidance that surpassed Wall Street expectations. Nvidia returned $15.4 billion to shareholders in share repurposes and cash dividends as part of the company’s first half of its fiscal 2025. The company said it had $7.5 billion remaining under its share repurchase plan, as of the end of its fiscal second quarter. Last year, Nvidia announced a $25 billion share buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results. Companies often experience a boom to their stock price after revealing stock buyback plans. In May, for instance, Apple announced a $110 billion stock buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results that showed overall sales fell 4% year over year and iPhone sales dropped 10% year over year. However, the iPhone maker’s shares rose 7% in after-hours trading, likely because Apple’s share buyback was the biggest in corporate history. With Nvidia’s shares dropping 4% in extended trading despite reporting solid financial results and announcing a stock buyback, some experts believe the company has been doing so well that it is getting harder to impress investors.

Nvidia More Room to Run Just Getting Started.csv,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they’ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don’t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical. Yes, Nvidia’s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn’t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now. Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn’t possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia’s place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn’t happened and Nvidia’s only gotten stronger. That’s not to say over time Nvidia won’t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it’s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution. Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations. I don’t think AI is a bubble but I do think that Nvidia and the market as a whole can get ahead of themselves.

"Nvidia reports earnings, Fed gathers in Jackson Hole What about this week.csv","In the final week of August, investors will be focused on two major events: Nvidia's earnings and the Federal Reserve's annual meeting in Jackson Hole. The Jackson Hole Economic Symposium will kick off on Thursday, with Fed Chair Jay Powell's address serving as the major event. Powell's comments on interest rates, the economy, and any indication that inflationary pressures are driving a reassessment of the Fed's present aims will be scrutinized. On the corporate front, Nvidia headlines the earnings story this week, with the chipmaker scheduled to publish data from a quarter that caused the chipmaker to increase its revenue forecast by 50%. Lowe's, BJ's Wholesale Club, and Peloton are also set to announce earnings this week. August is shaping up to be the worst month for stocks this year, with all three main averages closing last week lower after a hawkish read of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting sent equities lower and Treasury rates higher in the second half of the week. Economic data continues to come in stronger than expected, with the July retail sales report indicating a 0.7% increase in sales for the month, about double what economists forecast. The AtlantaFed's GDPNow projection now predicts third-quarter GDP growth of 5.8%, the strongest rate since the fourth quarter of 2021. Inflation has declined dramatically since Powell's Jackson Hole speech last year, when he predicted rates will climb until the ""job is done,"" lowering inflation. Powell has stated as recently as July that inflation is ""well above"" the Fed's long-run objective of 2%. On the corporate front, all eyes will be on Nvidia, which predicted that artificial intelligence demand will increase its current quarter sales projection from $7 billion to $11 billion. Nvidia stock is up about 200% year to date, but its gains have slowed along with the market since mid-July.

Qualcomm Approached Intel About a Takeover in Recent Days.csv,"Qualcomm recently approached Intel with a takeover proposal, marking what could be one of the largest tech deals in recent memory, according to sources. Intel, once valued at over $290 billion, has seen its market cap fall to around $90 billion after a challenging year in which its shares dropped 60%. While a deal is far from guaranteed, Qualcomm’s interest comes as Intel struggles to recover under CEO Pat Gelsinger’s turnaround plan, which has yet to deliver significant results. Should Intel be receptive, the deal could face heavy antitrust scrutiny, though some argue it might bolster U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor industry. Qualcomm may consider offloading parts of Intel to complete the acquisition. Both companies have sought to capitalize on the AI boom, though they’ve lagged behind Nvidia. Intel, grappling with factory delays and cost-cutting measures, is receiving government subsidies as part of its efforts to build chip factories. A Qualcomm takeover could enhance its portfolio by adding Intel’s dominance in PCs and servers to its smartphone chip business. Despite this potential merger, Intel continues to face major hurdles, including the possible need to split its design and manufacturing operations amid growing calls for the company to separate its business divisions.

S&P 20 years ago versus today Via @alerts on IG.csv,2004: Walmart ExxonMobil Chevron Citi IBM General Electric GM Ford 2024: Microsoft (7.84%) Apple (6.83%) Nvidia (3.8%) Alphabet (3.72%) Amazon (3.5%) Meta (2.1%) Berkshire Hathaway (1.71%) Broadcom (1.28%) Interesting to see the discrepancies and differences in the top eight from 2004 compared to the top eight from 2024. Not exactly surprising to see these giants at the top of the list. The year is 2044... does the top eight look relatively similar to what it looks like now? Feels hard to argue otherwise. Then again they probably said similar things in 2004. It just seems like GAFAM will continue to purchase any successful companies of smaller size. Rarely do we see standalone companies anymore (at least big ones).,0.5401,NEGATIVE,0.9989
Serious question from someone who took a four-year trading break.csv,Hey everyone After a long long hiatus and licking my wounds I decided to try trading once again. Recently I've been changing up my approach and doing 5-7 DTE spy options. And it's been going pretty decent however recently I got a couple of August 30th calls for Nvidia I managed to get in at a good position for 133 calls. My thesis is that it's going to keep pumping up to the day of earnings. I don't have any intention of holding the position up until expiration. My question is regarding theta decay and volatility. I know that the closer I got to the expiration the less profit I'll see as a percentage of my position. And I also understand that during high levels of volatility it can go both ways. And I'm not really asking for specific advice just kind of guidance or knowledge as to how that may affect my position. I'm holding them over the weekend and I'm expecting Monday to start off a little red but to finish off green and so I'm not quite sure if I want to sell half my positions and wait till earnings or if I should wait to earnings in general. I strongly believe that Nvidia is going to beat their earnings I just don't know how drastically that's going to affect the price action. Any and all input is definitely appreciated Thanks in advance,0.5421,NEGATIVE,0.9936

Super Micro Falls as Hindenburg Takes Aim With Short Report.csv,"Super Micro Computer Inc.'s shares took a hit on Tuesday following a short report from Hindenburg Research that questioned the company's financial practices and transparency. Hindenburg's report alleged significant accounting red flags, undisclosed related-party transactions, and potential violations of sanctions and export controls. Initially, the report caused Super Micro's stock to plummet by as much as 8.7%, but it later rebounded to close down 2.6%. The server manufacturer has been a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, with its high-performance servers in high demand for data centers. This surge in AI-related demand has driven significant growth for the company, doubling its revenue to $14.9 billion in the most recent fiscal year. Despite a steep decline from its March peak, Super Micro's stock remains up over 90% for the year, reflecting continued investor interest in the burgeoning AI sector. However, the Hindenburg report could intensify scrutiny on Super Micro's accounting practices and client relationships, particularly as the company has faced regulatory challenges in the past. In 2020, Super Micro resolved a U.S. SEC investigation by correcting its financial statements and paying a penalty for accounting issues from 2014 to 2017. As the AI market continues to expand, maintaining investor confidence will be crucial for Super Micro, especially amid concerns about the profitability of AI-optimized servers and the potential for increased regulatory oversight.

Technical Analysis Lesson - Reversal Day in Nvidia (NVDA).csv,"Every trader wants to know when the trend is changing from up to down or down to up. This happens when the leadership in the market changes from bulls to bears or bears to bulls. These trend changes are what every trader looks for. If they can accurately predict market turns, they can profit. That’s why they do what they do. Sometimes this change of leadership is slow and takes a long period of time to happen. These changes have price action that tends to show up on a chart as a ‘Rounded Top’ or ‘Rounded Bottom’ pattern. Sometimes the reversal is abrupt and takes place over a few time periods. This action tends to show up on a chart as a ‘V’ or ‘Inverted V’ reversal. But sometimes the trend changes just in one day... These dynamics can show up on a chart as a ‘Reversal Day’ pattern. One may have just happened in the stock of Nivida (NVDA). The Western world would call it an ‘Outside Reversal Day’. In candlestick terminology, it is called a ‘Bearish Engulfing Pattern’. It’s important to note that these candlestick patterns are at least 700 years old. They were developed by Japanese rice traders. It shows that the human nature which is illustrated in charts hasn’t changed. The name doesn’t matter. The action that it illustrates does. On Friday morning, it looked as though the uptrend in NVDA was going to continue for yet another day. It opened at a higher price than Thursday’s close. But then the tide turned… Over the day, the sellers came out of the woodwork. And not only did they hold off the assault. They overpowered the buyers and eventually pushed the price much lower. Importantly, Friday’s closing price was lower than Thursday’s opening price. This is frequently a characteristic of a trend that is reversing. Sometimes the change of leadership from bulls to bears happens over an extended time-period. But sometimes it occurs in just one day. That could be the case here.",0.5201,NEGATIVE,0.9938

AFRM - Reported a massive beat on earnings, following a beat on the top/bottom lines. EPS of -0.14 cents vs -0.51 cents expected, revenue of $659M vs $604M expected. Also cited a new goal of hitting operating profitability on a GAAP basis by 4th quarter of 2025. Analyst stated rate cuts would be beneficial for the company and allowed for greater loan sales.

TSM investment.csv,"Does anyone have any opinions on if this is a good investment? Given the recent AI boom everyone is focused on big players such as NVIDIA and AMD, but they are both supplied heavily by TSM for their chips. I don’t see much competition for TSM given they are so far advanced ahead of any American or Chinese competitor, and given the only increase in demand for AI technology, I don’t see how they wouldn’t grow. Yes the stock is expensive right now, but given the growth opportunity I would argue there is still plenty of room for expansion. Yes, China is a threat, but something tells me that China would not dare suffer the economic sanctions western nations would impose if they made a move in Taiwan. Trump has said he would likely put tariffs on the Taiwan semiconductor industry in order to grow domestic production, but still with tariffs, I don’t see big players switching to alternatives, as the gap between TSM and alternatives is very large.

TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand.csv,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

They are also mass producing 3nm chips which is starting to make up a nice chunk of their revenue. My main concern is obviously china but also that they are too tied to nvidia. Whenever i see them in the market, if NVIDIA is up 3%, they are up 6%, but if NVIDIA is down 3%, they are down 6-7%. Is it still a buy even though it has risen almost 50% this year?

Understand this about INTC.csv,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Below is a table showing the top 10 holdings for each ETF along with their percentage weight in the respective ETFs. This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings: Data Sources: SPY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Schwab, Yahoo Finance. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST) SFY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Zacks.com, Yahoo Finance. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST) Key Observations: Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting. It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation. I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors: Expense Ratio: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. Stock Selection Methodology: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. Performance Trends: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. Portfolio Diversification: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. Market Positioning: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. Innovative Approach of SoFi: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy. It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.

"Why Are Analysts Increasing NVIDIA’s Price Target Is It Out of Fear That Something Bad Will Happen, .csv","NVIDIA, often considered the heart of AI stocks, has recently been in the spotlight as analysts uniformly raise their stock targets. To me, this trend seems somewhat peculiar, even considering the current earnings season. The buoyant optimism surrounding the stock’s potential rise is sparking doubt in my mind.

In the broader context of the semiconductor sector, the recent quarterly earnings have been largely underwhelming. Yet, all semiconductor stocks appear to be buoyed by NVIDIA’s momentum. A stumble in NVIDIA’s stock could trigger a broader tech market downfall, while success could reignite a bullish trend for tech stocks.

So these have to be in the mix one way or another: Cocktail Potential Ingredients: Rising interest rates. Oil price shocks. Speculative tech investments. Overvaluation. Trade tensions. Stagflation. New round of Covid-19. Housing or Commercial Real Estate Bubble. So this is the speculative worse case scenario we could have without going as far as having a WWIII: February 13, 2024: CPI report comes in hot. S&P500 comes down 1.5%, some buy the tiny dip. February 15, 2024: Jobless claims rise. Doesn't alter the market but adds to the cocktail mix. February 16, 2024: A higher-than-expected PPI indicates increasing costs at the producer level, which can signal rising inflationary pressures. Producers might pass these higher costs onto consumers, leading to an increase in consumer prices and overall inflation. The Fed to consider tightening monetary policy more aggressively than previously anticipated to combat inflation. This could include raising interest rates or adjusting the pace of tapering asset purchases. Financial markets don't react negatively to a higher-than-expected PPI, as it they priced it in from the CPI report. February 21, 2024: Nvidia posts earnings, they actually do fine but investors realize that´s gonna be the ceiling for now so the stock falls 15%.

March 12, 2024: February´s CPI report comes in hot again, causing Algorithmic trades to sell and bring down the S&P500 another 2%. March 19-20, 2024: FOMC Meeting gives subtext of potentially not bringing interest rates down yet. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterates emphasis on the central bank's commitment to combating inflation, even if it requires keeping interest rates high for an extended period. This brings down the market sentiment down and numbers another 1%. April 5, 2024: In a CNBC YouTube video report, experts delve into the complexities of the current commercial real estate (CRE) market. The rise of remote work led to a decreased demand for office spaces, the pandemic trained people to make purchases online, commercial real estate bubble starts to show symptoms of cracking up. April 10, 2024: CPI report is on ambiguous. Not up, not down. Anything could happen at this point. Aprils report will define what the FED will do and the next 6 months of stock market activity. Market loses .5% April 17, 2024: Tom Lee's bullish perspective has been challenged by the prior events and during an interview he mentions that this was the turmoil he had been expecting but sees the S&P500 going back to 5,200 points by the end of the year. Currently at 4,600... 7.5% below all time highs. May 1, 2024: FOMC Meeting leaves a bad taste in mouth. Jerome shifts narrative towards not lowering interests rates yet. Market falls another 2.5% on the bad sentiment. May 15, 2024: Situations in the Middle East, such as tensions in Gaza or Iran, could impact global oil supplies by affecting regional stability and energy infrastructure. Saudi Arabia, a key OPEC member, might alter its oil production strategy in response to shifts in global politics, economic pressures, or changes in energy demand. Actions perceived as irrational could stem from strategic decisions to protect national interests, influence oil prices, or respond to international events. S&P500 falls 0.5%. July 8, 2024: A new wave of Covid-19 actually breaks through the collective deceit of it being over because death rates rise significantly and word spreads out again from hospital staff that's it's getting real bad. Stock market reacts in a mixed manner. Amazon and tech companies go up a little, small caps enter another bad rout. S&P500 falls 1%. July 20, 2024: Numbers start to confirm a Stagflation situation actually taking place. A significant slowdown in economic growth, rising unemployment rates, declining consumer spending, and a contraction in manufacturing. Inflation pressures, coupled with tightening monetary policies aimed at controlling price levels, contribute to decreased economic activity. Additionally, geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions serve as catalysts, further straining global markets. The interconnectedness of these factors in precipitate a recessionary environment. S&P500 falls .7%. July 23, 2024: Nvidia reports and disappoints, falls another 8% in tandem with other tech companies. July 25, 2024: Commercial Real Estate bubble pops and hits the news hard. S&P500 falls 1.4% At 13.6% the all time highs from January 2024. Currently at 4,400 points. August 14, 2024: After all the earnings reports it becomes increasingly clear: the FED won't lower rates and will keep them there for longer than expected; consumer spending is declining, companies keep firing people, the Bear narrative takes over.

Quarterly Highlights: • Earnings per share: 69 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected • Revenue: $5.83 billion vs. $5.72 billion expected • Expected Q3 Sales: $6.7 billion vs. $6.61 billion expected Financial Performance: • Net Income: $265 million (16 cents per share) vs. $27 million (2 cents per share) YoY • Data Center Revenue: Grew 115% YoY to $2.8 billion, driven by AI chip sales (Instinct GPUs) • Client Segment (PCs): Rose 49% YoY to $1.5 billion, indicating a recovering PC market • Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% YoY, below the expected $676 million • Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% YoY, slightly above the expected $856 million AMD’s AI chip sales, reported under the Data Center segment, saw significant growth, highlighting the company’s efforts to compete with Nvidia.

AMD to acquire server builder ZT Systems for 49 billion in cash and stock.csv,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced on Monday its plans to acquire server manufacturer ZT Systems for $4.9 billion, as part of its strategy to bolster its portfolio of artificial intelligence (AI) chips and hardware, and to compete more effectively against Nvidia. The acquisition will be financed with 75% cash and the remaining in stock, leveraging AMD’s $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments reported in the second quarter. The rising demands of AI computing have necessitated the use of thousands of interconnected chips to achieve the required processing power, making the design and construction of server systems increasingly critical. This acquisition will enable AMD to enhance its capabilities in this area. According to AMD CEO Lisa Su, the addition of ZT Systems’ engineers will accelerate the company’s ability to test and deploy its latest AI GPUs on a scale required by major cloud computing companies like Microsoft. Although AMD plans to incorporate ZT Systems into its operations, it has no intention of competing directly in the server manufacturing market. Instead, the company plans to divest its server manufacturing business after the acquisition is finalized, with no discussions yet held with potential buyers. ZT Systems CEO Frank Zhang will join AMD, reporting to Forrest Norrod, AMD’s data center chief. The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2025, will see AMD retaining about 1,000 of ZT Systems' roughly 2,500 employees. AMD anticipates that the acquisition will positively impact its adjusted financial performance by the end of 2025.

AMZN Earnings Preview- What to watch for tonight.csv,"Earnings from Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. will be crucial in guiding the Nasdaq 100 after a volatile period marked by extreme fluctuations. As the last megacaps to release results before Nvidia Corp. in August, these reports will set the tone for tech investors, particularly focusing on how artificial intelligence is driving growth in Amazon’s cloud-computing unit and boosting demand for Apple's next iPhone. The results will also provide valuable insights into the health of consumer spending, with Amazon shares already up about 25% this year. Amazon.com Inc. is set to release its Q2 earnings report after the market closes, with a conference call scheduled for 5:30 p.m. ET. Analysts project the company will report revenue of $148.8 billion, marking an 11% increase year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up from 65 cents in the same period last year. Amazon has guided for Q2 operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, signaling strong performance despite broader economic challenges. Key metrics expected by analysts include AWS revenue at nearly $26 billion, representing more than 17% year-over-year growth, and advertising revenue projected to reach $13 billion, a 21.7% increase from last year. The Stores segment, bolstered by events like Prime Day, is anticipated to show significant activity, while improvements in operating margins, especially in the North America segment, will be closely watched. Analysts also expect updates on AI initiatives and the overall capital expenditures for the year. Comments from analysts emphasize the importance of AI and cloud services for Amazon's future growth. Citi analysts, led by Ronald Josey, anticipate AWS revenue growth accelerated in Q2 due to generative AI tailwinds, while also predicting a beat in operating income thanks to improved retail efficiencies and strong advertising demand. Truist analyst Youssef Squali highlights Amazon's ability to gain share in global e-commerce and sees multiple growth vectors powering the company's continued expansion. Retail performance and consumer spending trends will be significant indicators, especially given mixed reports this earnings season. Analysts like Matt Stucky of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management note the importance of Amazon's retail margin expansion and its impact on profitability. Additionally, the potential for a surprise dividend announcement is a point of interest, as Amazon remains the last major tech company without a dividend program. Amazon's Q2 results will follow earnings reports from key competitors like Microsoft and Google, both of which had mixed receptions based on their cloud and AI performances. Wall Street's current focus is on tangible returns from AI investments, making Amazon's updates on its AI initiatives and AWS growth crucial for investor sentiment. The company's dominant position in the cloud market and ongoing efforts to enhance its e-commerce offerings will be under the microscope. Amazon saw its stock rise following a strong Q1 earnings report, showcasing impressive upside in both EPS and revenue. The standout metric was a significant 221% year-over-year increase in operating income to $15.31 billion, far surpassing the prior guidance of $8-12 billion. The company’s guidance for Q2 operating income of $10-14 billion also exceeded expectations. The Stores segment performed well, driven by successful shopping events like Amazon's Spring Deal Days in Europe and the first Big Spring Sale in Canada and the US. Faster delivery times, enhanced by regionalization efforts and cost-saving measures such as consolidating units into fewer boxes, boosted customer purchase frequency and overall spend. Additionally, Amazon is preparing for its 10th Prime Day event in July, which is expected to further drive sales. Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the highlight of the quarter, with a 17% growth in constant currency, an improvement from previous quarters. AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue business, with significant growth in both generative and non-generative AI workloads. The Advertising Services segment also showed robust growth, with a 24% increase in revenue to $11.82 billion, driven primarily by sponsored ads and early gains in Prime Video ads. Despite guiding Q2 revenue below consensus due to foreign exchange impacts, the strong performance in AWS and advertising has left investors optimistic.",0.5699,POSITIVE,0.9923

Some of it just recovered from 2022 to it's pre-2022 state, but Nvidia has 205% growth this year, which is crazy Index funds - the legendary S&P 500. Everyone says it's the most stable etc - but I've found other indexes with even better growth. SP500 usually have the 7-10% yearly return and last 5 years went up 56%, but for example the INDEX Vanguard Growth ETF went up 87% for the last 5 years - and it was also a steady growth, not a lucky spike during one period. What do you think, is it really smart to go with SP500 or are there other ones that are much better, even tho SP500 is so hyped by everyone? and if you agree - what other indexes with better return would you recommend? Leverage - I'm not familiar with how much can you leverage in stocks, but for people that invest in the top 10, which most likely will go up in the future, wouldn't be smarter to invest it with i.e 5x leverage, since the companies like Microsoft are stable, and eventually will grow? Stock Math - let's say I invest $10.000 in a stock and it declines -50%. I know have $5.000. If it goes up by 50%, do I get $7.500 or do I get my $10.000 back?

Dell Earnings.csv,"I wanted to get everyone’s take on DELL (down nearly 11% after hours.) I bought 106 shares at 130.5 during their recent run.

The company seems solid, especially with its strength in enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure, even though consumer PC sales have been an ongoing problem. Despite this Dell has been doubling down on AI, data centers, and hybrid cloud, which I believe should set them up well for growth in 2025. They also stand to benefit from SMCI’s issues and Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure. With the growing focus on AI and enterprise tech, it feels like Dell could see steady, long-term growth and break out to that $150 range by Q2 2024. Thoughts? Should I continue to hold?

"Feds set stage for antitrust probes of Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI.csv","The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are nearing an agreement to divvy up investigations of potential anticompetitive conduct by some of the world’s largest technology companies in the artificial intelligence industry, according to three people with knowledge of the negotiations. As part of the arrangement, the DOJ is poised to investigate Nvidia and its leading position in supplying the high-end semiconductors underpinning AI computing, while the FTC is set to probe whether Microsoft, and its partner OpenAI, have unfair advantages with the rapidly evolving technology, particularly around the technology used for large language models. The three companies have been leaders in AI, with the technology powering Nvidia today to a $3 trillion market value, second only to Microsoft. The deal has been negotiated for nearly a year. And while leaders of both agencies have expressed urgency in ensuring that the rapidly growing artificial intelligence technology is not dominated by existing tech giants, until an agreement is finalized, there was very little investigative work they could do.

Fundamentals behind a USA market drop this week & some positives.csv,"The problem areas in the USA: -------------------------- *- The Schiller PE is at a very high level. Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble. So stocks are highly expensive. *- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022! We are more of a service economy than a goods economy, *- World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle. That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local sales declines are offset. Additionally the trade war hampers both sides. *- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels. *- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers. You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term. People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank. However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials. AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth. AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales. So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia. This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW. I don't own any MKSI. This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording. So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN. Good areas: -------------------------------------- *- Labor productivity is up consistently since Q3 2022. one can see tradingeconomics dot com USA productivity *- Gasoline is lower than last year *- Retail sales are going fine, [ per a recent NPR radio article ] Nuetral ---------------------------------------- *- Labor force participation is not higher than Sept 2023. No more sales growth from people returning to work. Participation is up recently. tradingeconomics has this info. *- Consumer confidence is still down since January 2020. My one man's take ---------------- The problem areas are serious. There is enough weight in the bear issues to cause the stock market to give up most of its gains this year.",0.5628,NEGATIVE,0.9999

This divergence indicates that while the index appears strong, the underlying market health is weaker. Liz Ann Sonders, Chief Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab, pointed out that beneath the surface, the average stock in the Nasdaq has experienced a 37% drawdown, compared to the 7% maximum drawdown of the index from its year-to-date high. This suggests significant churn and rotation not visible when solely looking at index level changes. Further, the share of S&P 500 members trading above their 50-day moving average has dropped below 50%, while the index itself continues to trade above its intermediate-term average by more than 4%.

"Impacting NVDA is underlying logic,what does OpenAI is change in strategy mean.csv","Big model pre-training bottleneck: Silicon Valley AI labs are generally struggling with new model training, with OpenAI's Orion and Google's Gemini 2.0 failing to significantly outperform their predecessors, defying the “law of scaling”. This law used to mean that model performance would continue to increase with data and computation, but the scaling effect has now plateaued. Computing in the reasoning phase: To overcome pre-training bottlenecks, OpenAI and other labs are exploring “compute on test” techniques that enable human-like multi-step reasoning by allowing models to generate and evaluate multiple possibilities in real-time during the reasoning phase. This approach can be used more effectively for complex tasks such as mathematics and coding to optimize reasoning performance. Hardware Demand Shift: Market demand is likely to shift from large-scale pre-training clusters to inference clouds as new technologies reduce parameter requirements. This will weaken NVIDIA's monopoly in the training chip market, and the inference chip market may see more competition, especially as companies such as Groq may fill the new demand. Capital Trends: Venture capital organizations are highly concerned about this change, and are gradually investing more resources in distributed inference clouds to cater to the distributed server needs of inference computing.",0.5346,POSITIVE,0.6048

In Q3 2023, the company reported a total revenue of $14.2 billion, a decrease of 8% from the same quarter in the previous year. This decline was primarily due to decreases in revenue across its major segments: the Client Computing Group (CCG) revenue decreased by 3%, the Data Center and AI Group (DCAI) by 10%, and the Network and Edge Group (NEX) by a significant 32%. The company’s financial strategy also reflects a commitment to operational efficiency and cost management. By streamlining processes and optimizing resources, Intel aims to improve its profitability and shareholder value in the long term. This approach is crucial as the company faces intense competition from other tech giants and emerging players in the semiconductor industry. In conclusion, Intel’s recent financial performance, though marked by challenges, showcases the company’s strategic efforts to remain a dominant player in the tech industry. The company’s focus on innovation, operational efficiency, and market adaptability will be key to its future success and financial stability.

After conducting a comprehensive 10-year forecast, our analysis indicates that Intel’s current valuation appears to be justifiable, taking into account a range of scenarios. These scenarios are grounded in conservative (low), moderate (mid), and optimistic (high) financial assumptions, providing a robust framework for evaluating the company’s long-term potential. Concluding Remarks: In conclusion, Intel Corporation stands at a pivotal point. Its strategic pivots, financial resilience, and commitment to innovation are commendable. Yet, the road ahead is fraught with challenges and competition. Intel’s journey will be a testament to its adaptability and resilience in an ever-evolving tech landscape. For investors, keeping a keen eye on Intel’s execution of its ambitious plans will be crucial in assessing its long-term potential in the dynamic semiconductor industry.",0.5575,POSITIVE,0.9995
Intel potential comeback.csv,"Hey! Intel seems like a company that's really struggling right now. Their stock just dropped to around $20.16, and it’s not just the GPU market giving them trouble. They’re battling issues on multiple fronts. First off, their foundry business (where they manufacture chips) is bleeding money – about $7 billion in annual losses! They’re not expected to break even there until at least 2027. On top of that, they’re losing market share to AMD and Nvidia, both in CPUs and GPUs. Nvidia is dominating with AI, and AMD is taking more and more of the gaming market. It also feels like they completely missed the whole AI boom. Nvidia is raking in insane profits, while Intel seems to be… just watching? And to make things worse, their CEO recently stepped down, which makes their future even more uncertain. That said, they’ve just launched their new Arc B580 and B570 budget GPUs. Nvidia and AMD seem more focused on AI and data centers right now, so maybe Intel has a shot at carving out a space in gaming? But is that really enough to turn things around? What do you guys think?

Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,NEGATIVE,0.9443

Hi! I’m Dan Howley, the tech editor at Yahoo Finance, and Nvidia has seemingly been at the forefront of virtually everything I’ve covered since ChatGPT hit the scene in 2022. I’ve been covering the tech space for 13 years and tracking Nvidia for even longer. I built my first desktop PC with an Nvidia graphics card in high school and have continued using its products ever since. Now I, like everyone else, am focused on Nvidia’s AI efforts, from reporting on how they’re dealing with the threat of increased competition to attending the company’s GTC conference to chatting with CEO Jensen Huang alongside my colleague Julie Hyman. With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia’s chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like AMD are gaining steam, and Nvidia’s own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant. How that plays out over the next few years is anyone’s guess. In today’s fiscal 2025 third quarter earnings report, Nvidia beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines on the strength of sales of its high-powered AI chips. 💵 Revenue: $35.08B vs $33.2B expected 💲 Adjusted EPS: $0.81 vs $0.74 expected 💾 Data center revenue: $30.8B vs $29B expected Nvidia also said it anticipates revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, for the fiscal fourth quarter.

Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&P 500 gains.csv,"= just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing = The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023 https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9 The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions. It’s an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve’s inflation battle, noted FactSet’s Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post. The 10 top performing days for the S&P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%. The S&P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday’s close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%. Through Dec. 22, the S&P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%. Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said. That didn’t mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote. Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found. Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July. The strategy “indicates the Fed’s measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,” Jakobsen said. The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks’ bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group’s announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering. SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a “mini” banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown. Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks — Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78% , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, 0.16%, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%, Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%, Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%, and Meta Platforms Inc. META, 0.56%. See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024? Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind. The S&P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted. In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high: The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&P 500’s weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted. Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&P 500’s overall return, he wrote, with the company’s success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.",0.5482,NEGATIVE,0.9995
Mega-caps vs small caps.csv,"The current state of the stock market exhibits a stark contrast between the performance of mega-cap and small-cap stocks, as investors grapple with mixed signals from major corporations and broader market indices.  Recent developments have highlighted this divide, with Microsoft's upcoming earnings report set to further shape the narrative. Mega-Cap Weakness and Market Impact Microsoft, a key player in the technology sector, is set to report its earnings after the market close, and its performance could significantly influence investor sentiment.  The recent underperformance of large-cap stocks like Merck and Procter & Gamble, both of which have disappointed with earnings guidance, has contributed to the Nasdaq Composite's (-0.9%) and S&P 500's (-0.4%) downward pressure.  This weakness is reflected in the Vanguard Mega-Cap Growth ETF (MGK), which is down 1.1%. Small-Cap Resilience In contrast, small-cap stocks have shown relative strength, with the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 Value Index posting gains.  The equal-weighted S&P 500 is also holding its own, indicating that smaller companies are providing a stabilizing force in the market.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, buoyed by the financials and energy sectors, adds to this resilience. Sectors in Focus The IT sector, weighed down by NVIDIA's (-5.0%) decline ahead of AMD's earnings release, is leading the pack of losers.  Consumer staples, also negatively impacted, are lagging behind. On the other hand, financials, and energy sectors are posting gains, offering a glimmer of hope for investors seeking opportunities. Treasuries and Market Sentiment The Treasury market remains relatively calm, with the 2-yr note yield down to 4.38% and the 10-yr note yield at 4.17%.  Economic indicators, such as the better-than-expected consumer confidence index and the Bank of Japan's policy decision, have not sparked significant market movements, suggesting that investors are cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's FOMC decision on Wednesday. As we await Microsoft's earnings report, the stock market's divide between mega-cap and small-cap stocks is a cause for concern, especially for those relying on large-cap performance.  However, the resilience of small-cap companies and select sectors is providing a silver lining. Investors should stay vigilant, monitor market reactions to key earnings releases, and consider a diversified portfolio that takes into account the current market dynamics.  The Federal Reserve's decision will likely play a crucial role in determining the market's next course of action.",0.5419,NEGATIVE,0.9136

MSFT faces long-term potential disadvantages.csv,"I think one of the main reasons Microsoft is a great long-term investment is its long history of generating a lot of free cash flow. At the time of writing, the company's free cash flow margin is over 30%, with free cash flow rising from $15.9 billion in 2009 to $74.1 billion in the last 12 months. This financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments. While Microsoft may not seem like a value investment, in my opinion, its pricing is reasonable given its continued revenue and earnings growth, and it's likely to continue for the foreseeable future. I estimate EPS growth of 13% on a regular basis over the next 12 months. Based on this projection, I have a price target of $482.40 and estimate that the stock will trade at a non-GAAP P/E ratio of around 36. Looking ahead, I expect Microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15% over the next 5 to 10 years. While this prospect necessitates buying the stock at a fair valuation, I believe the current price provides an opportunity. The company's forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is only 6.5% above its five-year average, while its forward diluted earnings per share growth rate is nearly the same at 5.8%. MSFT faces long-term potential headwinds One potential challenge to Microsoft's long-term growth in AI is that its adoption can be cyclical. Currently, the demand for AI systems is high, which has prompted Microsoft and other big tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion. However, when the current trend peaks (likely due to macroeconomic constraints), growth may slow. According to the TipRanks risk analysis tool, Microsoft is exposed to 32% risk from legal and regulatory factors, which is higher than the industry average and could impact its AI operations due to increased scrutiny of data privacy and AI governance. Given this outlook, I expect some volatility in Microsoft's long-term growth trajectory, although it may not be as good as NVIDIA NVDA -0.06% ▼ and so on semiconductor companies so obvious. As market sentiment fluctuates, cyclical price and valuation declines coincide with temporarily lower growth rates and may provide more attractive buying opportunities. There is also a risk that Microsoft and other Big Tech players could over-invest in AI infrastructure. With 21% of its risk related to Tech & Innovation, Microsoft’s heavy investment in AI-driven initiatives, including data center infrastructure, could result in lower-than-expected returns if industry growth does not meet expectations. This may impact free cash flow margins in the medium term, contributing to further volatility.",0.5607,NEGATIVE,0.8794

Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is on a path to exceed its earnings expectations next month when its Q3 report comes out. While an earnings beat is not fully guaranteed, the latest earnings results of the company’s peers, suppliers, clients, and businesses that have a connection to the generative AI industry point to Nvidia having a stellar performance in Q3. The demand for its AI GPUs remains high, the company has been receiving upward revisions recently, and its stock is trading around its all-time high levels with a potential to appreciate even further in the upcoming months.

Nvidia announces 50 billion stock buyback.csv,"Nvidia said Wednesday that its board of directors has approved a $50 billion stock buyback. The computer chip giant announced the share repurchase as part of its fiscal second-quarter earnings, in which it reported earnings and guidance that surpassed Wall Street expectations. Nvidia returned $15.4 billion to shareholders in share repurposes and cash dividends as part of the company’s first half of its fiscal 2025. The company said it had $7.5 billion remaining under its share repurchase plan, as of the end of its fiscal second quarter. Last year, Nvidia announced a $25 billion share buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results. Companies often experience a boom to their stock price after revealing stock buyback plans. In May, for instance, Apple announced a $110 billion stock buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results that showed overall sales fell 4% year over year and iPhone sales dropped 10% year over year. However, the iPhone maker’s shares rose 7% in after-hours trading, likely because Apple’s share buyback was the biggest in corporate history. With Nvidia’s shares dropping 4% in extended trading despite reporting solid financial results and announcing a stock buyback, some experts believe the company has been doing so well that it is getting harder to impress investors.

Nvidia More Room to Run Just Getting Started.csv,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they’ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don’t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical. Yes, Nvidia’s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn’t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now. Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn’t possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia’s place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn’t happened and Nvidia’s only gotten stronger. That’s not to say over time Nvidia won’t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it’s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution. Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations. I don’t think AI is a bubble but I do think that Nvidia and the market as a whole can get ahead of themselves.

"Nvidia reports earnings, Fed gathers in Jackson Hole What about this week.csv","In the final week of August, investors will be focused on two major events: Nvidia's earnings and the Federal Reserve's annual meeting in Jackson Hole. The Jackson Hole Economic Symposium will kick off on Thursday, with Fed Chair Jay Powell's address serving as the major event. Powell's comments on interest rates, the economy, and any indication that inflationary pressures are driving a reassessment of the Fed's present aims will be scrutinized. On the corporate front, Nvidia headlines the earnings story this week, with the chipmaker scheduled to publish data from a quarter that caused the chipmaker to increase its revenue forecast by 50%. Lowe's, BJ's Wholesale Club, and Peloton are also set to announce earnings this week. August is shaping up to be the worst month for stocks this year, with all three main averages closing last week lower after a hawkish read of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting sent equities lower and Treasury rates higher in the second half of the week. Economic data continues to come in stronger than expected, with the July retail sales report indicating a 0.7% increase in sales for the month, about double what economists forecast. The AtlantaFed's GDPNow projection now predicts third-quarter GDP growth of 5.8%, the strongest rate since the fourth quarter of 2021. Inflation has declined dramatically since Powell's Jackson Hole speech last year, when he predicted rates will climb until the ""job is done,"" lowering inflation. Powell has stated as recently as July that inflation is ""well above"" the Fed's long-run objective of 2%. On the corporate front, all eyes will be on Nvidia, which predicted that artificial intelligence demand will increase its current quarter sales projection from $7 billion to $11 billion. Nvidia stock is up about 200% year to date, but its gains have slowed along with the market since mid-July.

Qualcomm Approached Intel About a Takeover in Recent Days.csv,"Qualcomm recently approached Intel with a takeover proposal, marking what could be one of the largest tech deals in recent memory, according to sources. Intel, once valued at over $290 billion, has seen its market cap fall to around $90 billion after a challenging year in which its shares dropped 60%. While a deal is far from guaranteed, Qualcomm’s interest comes as Intel struggles to recover under CEO Pat Gelsinger’s turnaround plan, which has yet to deliver significant results. Should Intel be receptive, the deal could face heavy antitrust scrutiny, though some argue it might bolster U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor industry. Qualcomm may consider offloading parts of Intel to complete the acquisition. Both companies have sought to capitalize on the AI boom, though they’ve lagged behind Nvidia. Intel, grappling with factory delays and cost-cutting measures, is receiving government subsidies as part of its efforts to build chip factories. A Qualcomm takeover could enhance its portfolio by adding Intel’s dominance in PCs and servers to its smartphone chip business. Despite this potential merger, Intel continues to face major hurdles, including the possible need to split its design and manufacturing operations amid growing calls for the company to separate its business divisions.

I know that the closer I got to the expiration the less profit I'll see as a percentage of my position. And I also understand that during high levels of volatility it can go both ways. And I'm not really asking for specific advice just kind of guidance or knowledge as to how that may affect my position. I'm holding them over the weekend and I'm expecting Monday to start off a little red but to finish off green and so I'm not quite sure if I want to sell half my positions and wait till earnings or if I should wait to earnings in general. I strongly believe that Nvidia is going to beat their earnings I just don't know how drastically that's going to affect the price action. Any and all input is definitely appreciated Thanks in advance,0.5421,NEGATIVE,0.9936

Super Micro Falls as Hindenburg Takes Aim With Short Report.csv,"Super Micro Computer Inc.'s shares took a hit on Tuesday following a short report from Hindenburg Research that questioned the company's financial practices and transparency. Hindenburg's report alleged significant accounting red flags, undisclosed related-party transactions, and potential violations of sanctions and export controls. Initially, the report caused Super Micro's stock to plummet by as much as 8.7%, but it later rebounded to close down 2.6%. The server manufacturer has been a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, with its high-performance servers in high demand for data centers. This surge in AI-related demand has driven significant growth for the company, doubling its revenue to $14.9 billion in the most recent fiscal year. Despite a steep decline from its March peak, Super Micro's stock remains up over 90% for the year, reflecting continued investor interest in the burgeoning AI sector. However, the Hindenburg report could intensify scrutiny on Super Micro's accounting practices and client relationships, particularly as the company has faced regulatory challenges in the past. In 2020, Super Micro resolved a U.S. SEC investigation by correcting its financial statements and paying a penalty for accounting issues from 2014 to 2017. As the AI market continues to expand, maintaining investor confidence will be crucial for Super Micro, especially amid concerns about the profitability of AI-optimized servers and the potential for increased regulatory oversight.

Technical Analysis Lesson - Reversal Day in Nvidia (NVDA).csv,"Every trader wants to know when the trend is changing from up to down or down to up. This happens when the leadership in the market changes from bulls to bears or bears to bulls. These trend changes are what every trader looks for. If they can accurately predict market turns, they can profit. That’s why they do what they do. Sometimes this change of leadership is slow and takes a long period of time to happen. These changes have price action that tends to show up on a chart as a ‘Rounded Top’ or ‘Rounded Bottom’ pattern. Sometimes the reversal is abrupt and takes place over a few time periods. This action tends to show up on a chart as a ‘V’ or ‘Inverted V’ reversal. But sometimes the trend changes just in one day... These dynamics can show up on a chart as a ‘Reversal Day’ pattern. One may have just happened in the stock of Nivida (NVDA). The Western world would call it an ‘Outside Reversal Day’. In candlestick terminology, it is called a ‘Bearish Engulfing Pattern’. It’s important to note that these candlestick patterns are at least 700 years old. They were developed by Japanese rice traders. It shows that the human nature which is illustrated in charts hasn’t changed. The name doesn’t matter. The action that it illustrates does. On Friday morning, it looked as though the uptrend in NVDA was going to continue for yet another day. It opened at a higher price than Thursday’s close. But then the tide turned… Over the day, the sellers came out of the woodwork. And not only did they hold off the assault. They overpowered the buyers and eventually pushed the price much lower. Importantly, Friday’s closing price was lower than Thursday’s opening price. This is frequently a characteristic of a trend that is reversing. Sometimes the change of leadership from bulls to bears happens over an extended time-period. But sometimes it occurs in just one day. That could be the case here.",0.5201,NEGATIVE,0.9938

TSM investment.csv,"Does anyone have any opinions on if this is a good investment? Given the recent AI boom everyone is focused on big players such as NVIDIA and AMD, but they are both supplied heavily by TSM for their chips. I don’t see much competition for TSM given they are so far advanced ahead of any American or Chinese competitor, and given the only increase in demand for AI technology, I don’t see how they wouldn’t grow. Yes the stock is expensive right now, but given the growth opportunity I would argue there is still plenty of room for expansion. Yes, China is a threat, but something tells me that China would not dare suffer the economic sanctions western nations would impose if they made a move in Taiwan. Trump has said he would likely put tariffs on the Taiwan semiconductor industry in order to grow domestic production, but still with tariffs, I don’t see big players switching to alternatives, as the gap between TSM and alternatives is very large.

TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand.csv,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

They are also mass producing 3nm chips which is starting to make up a nice chunk of their revenue. My main concern is obviously china but also that they are too tied to nvidia. Whenever i see them in the market, if NVIDIA is up 3%, they are up 6%, but if NVIDIA is down 3%, they are down 6-7%. Is it still a buy even though it has risen almost 50% this year?

Understand this about INTC.csv,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Below is a table showing the top 10 holdings for each ETF along with their percentage weight in the respective ETFs. This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings: Data Sources: SPY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Schwab, Yahoo Finance. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST) SFY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Zacks.com, Yahoo Finance. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST) Key Observations: Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting. It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation. I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors: Expense Ratio: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. Stock Selection Methodology: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. Performance Trends: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. Portfolio Diversification: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. Market Positioning: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. Innovative Approach of SoFi: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy. It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.

"Why Are Analysts Increasing NVIDIA’s Price Target Is It Out of Fear That Something Bad Will Happen, .csv","NVIDIA, often considered the heart of AI stocks, has recently been in the spotlight as analysts uniformly raise their stock targets.

Microsoft is privy to specific data regarding demand and metrics for OpenAI’s consumer and enterprise solutions, which serves as a crucial indicator of AI sentiment, second only to Nvidia. Remember the partnership with Apple? 2. AMD’s Earnings Report: AMD has projected significant demand and growth, suggesting a positive trend. If AMD is experiencing this level of demand, it’s worth considering what Nvidia might be experiencing. AMD indicated no signs of slowing down in AI product demand through 2025 and beyond.

Quarterly Highlights: • Earnings per share: 69 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected • Revenue: $5.83 billion vs. $5.72 billion expected • Expected Q3 Sales: $6.7 billion vs. $6.61 billion expected Financial Performance: • Net Income: $265 million (16 cents per share) vs. $27 million (2 cents per share) YoY • Data Center Revenue: Grew 115% YoY to $2.8 billion, driven by AI chip sales (Instinct GPUs) • Client Segment (PCs): Rose 49% YoY to $1.5 billion, indicating a recovering PC market • Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% YoY, below the expected $676 million • Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% YoY, slightly above the expected $856 million AMD’s AI chip sales, reported under the Data Center segment, saw significant growth, highlighting the company’s efforts to compete with Nvidia. AMD’s MI300X AI chip aims to capture market share from Nvidia, which has seen its stock double this year due to high demand for AI GPUs. Despite a challenging year with shares down 6% in 2024, AMD remains the second-largest vendor of data center GPUs, trailing Nvidia. Investors are focused on AMD’s ability to grow its AI business, with the company anticipating $4 billion in AI chip sales this year, accounting for 15% of its total expected sales. AMD’s core business in CPUs for laptops and servers and its growing AI chip segment position the company as a significant player in the evolving technology landscape.

AMD to acquire server builder ZT Systems for 49 billion in cash and stock.csv,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced on Monday its plans to acquire server manufacturer ZT Systems for $4.9 billion, as part of its strategy to bolster its portfolio of artificial intelligence (AI) chips and hardware, and to compete more effectively against Nvidia. The acquisition will be financed with 75% cash and the remaining in stock, leveraging AMD’s $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments reported in the second quarter. The rising demands of AI computing have necessitated the use of thousands of interconnected chips to achieve the required processing power, making the design and construction of server systems increasingly critical. This acquisition will enable AMD to enhance its capabilities in this area. According to AMD CEO Lisa Su, the addition of ZT Systems’ engineers will accelerate the company’s ability to test and deploy its latest AI GPUs on a scale required by major cloud computing companies like Microsoft. Although AMD plans to incorporate ZT Systems into its operations, it has no intention of competing directly in the server manufacturing market. Instead, the company plans to divest its server manufacturing business after the acquisition is finalized, with no discussions yet held with potential buyers. ZT Systems CEO Frank Zhang will join AMD, reporting to Forrest Norrod, AMD’s data center chief. The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2025, will see AMD retaining about 1,000 of ZT Systems' roughly 2,500 employees. AMD anticipates that the acquisition will positively impact its adjusted financial performance by the end of 2025.

AMZN Earnings Preview- What to watch for tonight.csv,"Earnings from Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. will be crucial in guiding the Nasdaq 100 after a volatile period marked by extreme fluctuations. As the last megacaps to release results before Nvidia Corp. in August, these reports will set the tone for tech investors, particularly focusing on how artificial intelligence is driving growth in Amazon’s cloud-computing unit and boosting demand for Apple's next iPhone. The results will also provide valuable insights into the health of consumer spending, with Amazon shares already up about 25% this year. Amazon.com Inc. is set to release its Q2 earnings report after the market closes, with a conference call scheduled for 5:30 p.m. ET. Analysts project the company will report revenue of $148.8 billion, marking an 11% increase year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up from 65 cents in the same period last year. Amazon has guided for Q2 operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, signaling strong performance despite broader economic challenges. Key metrics expected by analysts include AWS revenue at nearly $26 billion, representing more than 17% year-over-year growth, and advertising revenue projected to reach $13 billion, a 21.7% increase from last year. The Stores segment, bolstered by events like Prime Day, is anticipated to show significant activity, while improvements in operating margins, especially in the North America segment, will be closely watched. Analysts also expect updates on AI initiatives and the overall capital expenditures for the year. Comments from analysts emphasize the importance of AI and cloud services for Amazon's future growth. Citi analysts, led by Ronald Josey, anticipate AWS revenue growth accelerated in Q2 due to generative AI tailwinds, while also predicting a beat in operating income thanks to improved retail efficiencies and strong advertising demand. Truist analyst Youssef Squali highlights Amazon's ability to gain share in global e-commerce and sees multiple growth vectors powering the company's continued expansion. Retail performance and consumer spending trends will be significant indicators, especially given mixed reports this earnings season. Analysts like Matt Stucky of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management note the importance of Amazon's retail margin expansion and its impact on profitability. Additionally, the potential for a surprise dividend announcement is a point of interest, as Amazon remains the last major tech company without a dividend program. Amazon's Q2 results will follow earnings reports from key competitors like Microsoft and Google, both of which had mixed receptions based on their cloud and AI performances. Wall Street's current focus is on tangible returns from AI investments, making Amazon's updates on its AI initiatives and AWS growth crucial for investor sentiment. The company's dominant position in the cloud market and ongoing efforts to enhance its e-commerce offerings will be under the microscope. Amazon saw its stock rise following a strong Q1 earnings report, showcasing impressive upside in both EPS and revenue. The standout metric was a significant 221% year-over-year increase in operating income to $15.31 billion, far surpassing the prior guidance of $8-12 billion. The company’s guidance for Q2 operating income of $10-14 billion also exceeded expectations. The Stores segment performed well, driven by successful shopping events like Amazon's Spring Deal Days in Europe and the first Big Spring Sale in Canada and the US. Faster delivery times, enhanced by regionalization efforts and cost-saving measures such as consolidating units into fewer boxes, boosted customer purchase frequency and overall spend. Additionally, Amazon is preparing for its 10th Prime Day event in July, which is expected to further drive sales. Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the highlight of the quarter, with a 17% growth in constant currency, an improvement from previous quarters. AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue business, with significant growth in both generative and non-generative AI workloads. The Advertising Services segment also showed robust growth, with a 24% increase in revenue to $11.82 billion, driven primarily by sponsored ads and early gains in Prime Video ads. Despite guiding Q2 revenue below consensus due to foreign exchange impacts, the strong performance in AWS and advertising has left investors optimistic.",0.5699,POSITIVE,0.9923

Some of it just recovered from 2022 to it's pre-2022 state, but Nvidia has 205% growth this year, which is crazy Index funds - the legendary S&P 500. Everyone says it's the most stable etc - but I've found other indexes with even better growth. SP500 usually have the 7-10% yearly return and last 5 years went up 56%, but for example the INDEX Vanguard Growth ETF went up 87% for the last 5 years - and it was also a steady growth, not a lucky spike during one period. What do you think, is it really smart to go with SP500 or are there other ones that are much better, even tho SP500 is so hyped by everyone? and if you agree - what other indexes with better return would you recommend? Leverage - I'm not familiar with how much can you leverage in stocks, but for people that invest in the top 10, which most likely will go up in the future, wouldn't be smarter to invest it with i.e 5x leverage, since the companies like Microsoft are stable, and eventually will grow? Stock Math - let's say I invest $10.000 in a stock and it declines -50%. I know have $5.000. If it goes up by 50%, do I get $7.500 or do I get my $10.000 back?

The three companies have been leaders in AI, with the technology powering Nvidia today to a $3 trillion market value, second only to Microsoft. The deal has been negotiated for nearly a year. And while leaders of both agencies have expressed urgency in ensuring that the rapidly growing artificial intelligence technology is not dominated by existing tech giants, until an agreement is finalized, there was very little investigative work they could do. The agreement is not yet final, but could be completed as soon as this week. Spokespeople for the DOJ, FTC, Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",0.5569,NEGATIVE,0.9136

Freshman Thoughts.csv,"Got into stocks a couple months ago. Knew how they work for many years but saw it as gambling hehe, but here we are. A shaky start, freaked out, sold at a loss of 1300 some weeks ago, now riding the waves with more zen than before. Wanted some feedback from fellow comrades on this portfolio so far. Goal is to take diversified risk with a sprinkle of long term securities. Plan to withdraw some XEQT as funds are used for family vacations, rather keep them in that than an idle savings account. For other stocks, hoping they rocket over the next few years, and that looming monstrosity of WW3 doesn't kill this investment. Threw some dollars in SERV at a peak, holding to not realize that cost, but would rather have it in NVDA or WULF or something else.

Fundamentals behind a USA market drop this week & some positives.csv,"The problem areas in the USA: -------------------------- *- The Schiller PE is at a very high level. Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble. So stocks are highly expensive. *- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022! We are more of a service economy than a goods economy, *- World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle. That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local sales declines are offset. Additionally the trade war hampers both sides. *- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels. *- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers. You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term. People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank. However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials. AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth. AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales. So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia. This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW. I don't own any MKSI. This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording. So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN. Good areas: -------------------------------------- *- Labor productivity is up consistently since Q3 2022. one can see tradingeconomics dot com USA productivity *- Gasoline is lower than last year *- Retail sales are going fine, [ per a recent NPR radio article ] Nuetral ---------------------------------------- *- Labor force participation is not higher than Sept 2023. No more sales growth from people returning to work. Participation is up recently. tradingeconomics has this info. *- Consumer confidence is still down since January 2020. My one man's take ---------------- The problem areas are serious. There is enough weight in the bear issues to cause the stock market to give up most of its gains this year.",0.5628,NEGATIVE,0.9999

This divergence indicates that while the index appears strong, the underlying market health is weaker. Liz Ann Sonders, Chief Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab, pointed out that beneath the surface, the average stock in the Nasdaq has experienced a 37% drawdown, compared to the 7% maximum drawdown of the index from its year-to-date high.

"Impacting NVDA is underlying logic,what does OpenAI is change in strategy mean.csv","Big model pre-training bottleneck: Silicon Valley AI labs are generally struggling with new model training, with OpenAI's Orion and Google's Gemini 2.0 failing to significantly outperform their predecessors, defying the “law of scaling”. This law used to mean that model performance would continue to increase with data and computation, but the scaling effect has now plateaued. Computing in the reasoning phase: To overcome pre-training bottlenecks, OpenAI and other labs are exploring “compute on test” techniques that enable human-like multi-step reasoning by allowing models to generate and evaluate multiple possibilities in real-time during the reasoning phase. This approach can be used more effectively for complex tasks such as mathematics and coding to optimize reasoning performance. Hardware Demand Shift: Market demand is likely to shift from large-scale pre-training clusters to inference clouds as new technologies reduce parameter requirements. This will weaken NVIDIA's monopoly in the training chip market, and the inference chip market may see more competition, especially as companies such as Groq may fill the new demand. Capital Trends: Venture capital organizations are highly concerned about this change, and are gradually investing more resources in distributed inference clouds to cater to the distributed server needs of inference computing.",0.5346,POSITIVE,0.6048

So are you focusing your investments on AI platforms (if so, which), or hardware (Nvidia and others) or Data Center REITs (American Tower, Equinix) or things like the Global X ETFs (which seem underperforming to me).

Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,NEGATIVE,0.9443

Hi! I’m Dan Howley, the tech editor at Yahoo Finance, and Nvidia has seemingly been at the forefront of virtually everything I’ve covered since ChatGPT hit the scene in 2022. I’ve been covering the tech space for 13 years and tracking Nvidia for even longer. I built my first desktop PC with an Nvidia graphics card in high school and have continued using its products ever since. Now I, like everyone else, am focused on Nvidia’s AI efforts, from reporting on how they’re dealing with the threat of increased competition to attending the company’s GTC conference to chatting with CEO Jensen Huang alongside my colleague Julie Hyman. With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia’s chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like AMD are gaining steam, and Nvidia’s own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant. How that plays out over the next few years is anyone’s guess. In today’s fiscal 2025 third quarter earnings report, Nvidia beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines on the strength of sales of its high-powered AI chips. 💵 Revenue: $35.08B vs $33.2B expected 💲 Adjusted EPS: $0.81 vs $0.74 expected 💾 Data center revenue: $30.8B vs $29B expected Nvidia also said it anticipates revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, for the fiscal fourth quarter.

Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&P 500 gains.csv,"= just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing = The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023 https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9 The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions. It’s an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve’s inflation battle, noted FactSet’s Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post. The 10 top performing days for the S&P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%. The S&P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday’s close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%. Through Dec. 22, the S&P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%. Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said. That didn’t mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote. Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found. Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July. The strategy “indicates the Fed’s measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,” Jakobsen said. The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks’ bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group’s announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering. SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a “mini” banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown. Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks — Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78% , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, 0.16%, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%, Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%, Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%, and Meta Platforms Inc. META, 0.56%. See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024? Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind. The S&P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted. In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high: The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&P 500’s weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted. Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&P 500’s overall return, he wrote, with the company’s success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.",0.5482,NEGATIVE,0.9995
Mega-caps vs small caps.csv,"The current state of the stock market exhibits a stark contrast between the performance of mega-cap and small-cap stocks, as investors grapple with mixed signals from major corporations and broader market indices.  Recent developments have highlighted this divide, with Microsoft's upcoming earnings report set to further shape the narrative. Mega-Cap Weakness and Market Impact Microsoft, a key player in the technology sector, is set to report its earnings after the market close, and its performance could significantly influence investor sentiment.  The recent underperformance of large-cap stocks like Merck and Procter & Gamble, both of which have disappointed with earnings guidance, has contributed to the Nasdaq Composite's (-0.9%) and S&P 500's (-0.4%) downward pressure.  This weakness is reflected in the Vanguard Mega-Cap Growth ETF (MGK), which is down 1.1%. Small-Cap Resilience In contrast, small-cap stocks have shown relative strength, with the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 Value Index posting gains.  The equal-weighted S&P 500 is also holding its own, indicating that smaller companies are providing a stabilizing force in the market.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, buoyed by the financials and energy sectors, adds to this resilience. Sectors in Focus The IT sector, weighed down by NVIDIA's (-5.0%) decline ahead of AMD's earnings release, is leading the pack of losers.  Consumer staples, also negatively impacted, are lagging behind. On the other hand, financials, and energy sectors are posting gains, offering a glimmer of hope for investors seeking opportunities. Treasuries and Market Sentiment The Treasury market remains relatively calm, with the 2-yr note yield down to 4.38% and the 10-yr note yield at 4.17%.  Economic indicators, such as the better-than-expected consumer confidence index and the Bank of Japan's policy decision, have not sparked significant market movements, suggesting that investors are cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's FOMC decision on Wednesday. As we await Microsoft's earnings report, the stock market's divide between mega-cap and small-cap stocks is a cause for concern, especially for those relying on large-cap performance.  However, the resilience of small-cap companies and select sectors is providing a silver lining. Investors should stay vigilant, monitor market reactions to key earnings releases, and consider a diversified portfolio that takes into account the current market dynamics.  The Federal Reserve's decision will likely play a crucial role in determining the market's next course of action.",0.5419,NEGATIVE,0.9136

MSFT faces long-term potential disadvantages.csv,"I think one of the main reasons Microsoft is a great long-term investment is its long history of generating a lot of free cash flow. At the time of writing, the company's free cash flow margin is over 30%, with free cash flow rising from $15.9 billion in 2009 to $74.1 billion in the last 12 months. This financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments. While Microsoft may not seem like a value investment, in my opinion, its pricing is reasonable given its continued revenue and earnings growth, and it's likely to continue for the foreseeable future. I estimate EPS growth of 13% on a regular basis over the next 12 months. Based on this projection, I have a price target of $482.40 and estimate that the stock will trade at a non-GAAP P/E ratio of around 36. Looking ahead, I expect Microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15% over the next 5 to 10 years. While this prospect necessitates buying the stock at a fair valuation, I believe the current price provides an opportunity. The company's forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is only 6.5% above its five-year average, while its forward diluted earnings per share growth rate is nearly the same at 5.8%. MSFT faces long-term potential headwinds One potential challenge to Microsoft's long-term growth in AI is that its adoption can be cyclical. Currently, the demand for AI systems is high, which has prompted Microsoft and other big tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion. However, when the current trend peaks (likely due to macroeconomic constraints), growth may slow. According to the TipRanks risk analysis tool, Microsoft is exposed to 32% risk from legal and regulatory factors, which is higher than the industry average and could impact its AI operations due to increased scrutiny of data privacy and AI governance. Given this outlook, I expect some volatility in Microsoft's long-term growth trajectory, although it may not be as good as NVIDIA NVDA -0.06% ▼ and so on semiconductor companies so obvious. As market sentiment fluctuates, cyclical price and valuation declines coincide with temporarily lower growth rates and may provide more attractive buying opportunities. There is also a risk that Microsoft and other Big Tech players could over-invest in AI infrastructure. With 21% of its risk related to Tech & Innovation, Microsoft’s heavy investment in AI-driven initiatives, including data center infrastructure, could result in lower-than-expected returns if industry growth does not meet expectations. This may impact free cash flow margins in the medium term, contributing to further volatility.",0.5607,NEGATIVE,0.8794

Short term return also applicable would consider selling and banking profits and leaving the initial 5k in the market. One more thing, a good app for stock trading? I’ve used Robinhood a bit and love the layout. I’ve had fidelity before it just wasn’t as simplified.

For reference, my next potential entries will depend on developments in the bigger-picture macro sentiment toward artificial intelligence & microchip industries, but for now, are as follows: entry #1 is around $445, entry #2 is around $410, and entry #3 around $375. Was thinking I would add 1 or 2 shares at entry 1, and then larger numbers of shares if price action takes us down to the other 2 circled areas.

Currently, Nvidia has all the chances to once again exceed expectations and improve guidance when its Q3 earnings report comes out in November. NVDA stock remains a BUY for me, and its upside could be even greater than previously expected. Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is on a path to exceed its earnings expectations next month when its Q3 report comes out. While an earnings beat is not fully guaranteed, the latest earnings results of the company’s peers, suppliers, clients, and businesses that have a connection to the generative AI industry point to Nvidia having a stellar performance in Q3. The demand for its AI GPUs remains high, the company has been receiving upward revisions recently, and its stock is trading around its all-time high levels with a potential to appreciate even further in the upcoming months. While challenges are gradually mounting, it’s still safe to assume that all the growth opportunities currently exceed the existing risks.

Nvidia announces 50 billion stock buyback.csv,"Nvidia said Wednesday that its board of directors has approved a $50 billion stock buyback. The computer chip giant announced the share repurchase as part of its fiscal second-quarter earnings, in which it reported earnings and guidance that surpassed Wall Street expectations. Nvidia returned $15.4 billion to shareholders in share repurposes and cash dividends as part of the company’s first half of its fiscal 2025. The company said it had $7.5 billion remaining under its share repurchase plan, as of the end of its fiscal second quarter. Last year, Nvidia announced a $25 billion share buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results. Companies often experience a boom to their stock price after revealing stock buyback plans. In May, for instance, Apple announced a $110 billion stock buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results that showed overall sales fell 4% year over year and iPhone sales dropped 10% year over year. However, the iPhone maker’s shares rose 7% in after-hours trading, likely because Apple’s share buyback was the biggest in corporate history. With Nvidia’s shares dropping 4% in extended trading despite reporting solid financial results and announcing a stock buyback, some experts believe the company has been doing so well that it is getting harder to impress investors.

Nvidia More Room to Run Just Getting Started.csv,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they’ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don’t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical. Yes, Nvidia’s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn’t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now. Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn’t possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia’s place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn’t happened and Nvidia’s only gotten stronger. That’s not to say over time Nvidia won’t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it’s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution. Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations. I don’t think AI is a bubble but I do think that Nvidia and the market as a whole can get ahead of themselves.

"Nvidia reports earnings, Fed gathers in Jackson Hole What about this week.csv","In the final week of August, investors will be focused on two major events: Nvidia's earnings and the Federal Reserve's annual meeting in Jackson Hole. The Jackson Hole Economic Symposium will kick off on Thursday, with Fed Chair Jay Powell's address serving as the major event. Powell's comments on interest rates, the economy, and any indication that inflationary pressures are driving a reassessment of the Fed's present aims will be scrutinized. On the corporate front, Nvidia headlines the earnings story this week, with the chipmaker scheduled to publish data from a quarter that caused the chipmaker to increase its revenue forecast by 50%. Lowe's, BJ's Wholesale Club, and Peloton are also set to announce earnings this week. August is shaping up to be the worst month for stocks this year, with all three main averages closing last week lower after a hawkish read of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting sent equities lower and Treasury rates higher in the second half of the week. Economic data continues to come in stronger than expected, with the July retail sales report indicating a 0.7% increase in sales for the month, about double what economists forecast. The AtlantaFed's GDPNow projection now predicts third-quarter GDP growth of 5.8%, the strongest rate since the fourth quarter of 2021. Inflation has declined dramatically since Powell's Jackson Hole speech last year, when he predicted rates will climb until the ""job is done,"" lowering inflation. Powell has stated as recently as July that inflation is ""well above"" the Fed's long-run objective of 2%. On the corporate front, all eyes will be on Nvidia, which predicted that artificial intelligence demand will increase its current quarter sales projection from $7 billion to $11 billion. Nvidia stock is up about 200% year to date, but its gains have slowed along with the market since mid-July.

Qualcomm Approached Intel About a Takeover in Recent Days.csv,"Qualcomm recently approached Intel with a takeover proposal, marking what could be one of the largest tech deals in recent memory, according to sources. Intel, once valued at over $290 billion, has seen its market cap fall to around $90 billion after a challenging year in which its shares dropped 60%. While a deal is far from guaranteed, Qualcomm’s interest comes as Intel struggles to recover under CEO Pat Gelsinger’s turnaround plan, which has yet to deliver significant results. Should Intel be receptive, the deal could face heavy antitrust scrutiny, though some argue it might bolster U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor industry. Qualcomm may consider offloading parts of Intel to complete the acquisition. Both companies have sought to capitalize on the AI boom, though they’ve lagged behind Nvidia. Intel, grappling with factory delays and cost-cutting measures, is receiving government subsidies as part of its efforts to build chip factories. A Qualcomm takeover could enhance its portfolio by adding Intel’s dominance in PCs and servers to its smartphone chip business.

Serious question from someone who took a four-year trading break.csv,Hey everyone After a long long hiatus and licking my wounds I decided to try trading once again. Recently I've been changing up my approach and doing 5-7 DTE spy options. And it's been going pretty decent however recently I got a couple of August 30th calls for Nvidia I managed to get in at a good position for 133 calls. My thesis is that it's going to keep pumping up to the day of earnings. I don't have any intention of holding the position up until expiration. My question is regarding theta decay and volatility. I know that the closer I got to the expiration the less profit I'll see as a percentage of my position. And I also understand that during high levels of volatility it can go both ways. And I'm not really asking for specific advice just kind of guidance or knowledge as to how that may affect my position. I'm holding them over the weekend and I'm expecting Monday to start off a little red but to finish off green and so I'm not quite sure if I want to sell half my positions and wait till earnings or if I should wait to earnings in general. I strongly believe that Nvidia is going to beat their earnings I just don't know how drastically that's going to affect the price action.

Super Micro Falls as Hindenburg Takes Aim With Short Report.csv,"Super Micro Computer Inc.'s shares took a hit on Tuesday following a short report from Hindenburg Research that questioned the company's financial practices and transparency. Hindenburg's report alleged significant accounting red flags, undisclosed related-party transactions, and potential violations of sanctions and export controls. Initially, the report caused Super Micro's stock to plummet by as much as 8.7%, but it later rebounded to close down 2.6%. The server manufacturer has been a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, with its high-performance servers in high demand for data centers. This surge in AI-related demand has driven significant growth for the company, doubling its revenue to $14.9 billion in the most recent fiscal year. Despite a steep decline from its March peak, Super Micro's stock remains up over 90% for the year, reflecting continued investor interest in the burgeoning AI sector. However, the Hindenburg report could intensify scrutiny on Super Micro's accounting practices and client relationships, particularly as the company has faced regulatory challenges in the past. In 2020, Super Micro resolved a U.S. SEC investigation by correcting its financial statements and paying a penalty for accounting issues from 2014 to 2017. As the AI market continues to expand, maintaining investor confidence will be crucial for Super Micro, especially amid concerns about the profitability of AI-optimized servers and the potential for increased regulatory oversight.

Technical Analysis Lesson - Reversal Day in Nvidia (NVDA).csv,"Every trader wants to know when the trend is changing from up to down or down to up. This happens when the leadership in the market changes from bulls to bears or bears to bulls. These trend changes are what every trader looks for. If they can accurately predict market turns, they can profit. That’s why they do what they do. Sometimes this change of leadership is slow and takes a long period of time to happen. These changes have price action that tends to show up on a chart as a ‘Rounded Top’ or ‘Rounded Bottom’ pattern. Sometimes the reversal is abrupt and takes place over a few time periods. This action tends to show up on a chart as a ‘V’ or ‘Inverted V’ reversal. But sometimes the trend changes just in one day... These dynamics can show up on a chart as a ‘Reversal Day’ pattern. One may have just happened in the stock of Nivida (NVDA). The Western world would call it an ‘Outside Reversal Day’. In candlestick terminology, it is called a ‘Bearish Engulfing Pattern’. It’s important to note that these candlestick patterns are at least 700 years old. They were developed by Japanese rice traders. It shows that the human nature which is illustrated in charts hasn’t changed. The name doesn’t matter. The action that it illustrates does. On Friday morning, it looked as though the uptrend in NVDA was going to continue for yet another day. It opened at a higher price than Thursday’s close. But then the tide turned… Over the day, the sellers came out of the woodwork. And not only did they hold off the assault. They overpowered the buyers and eventually pushed the price much lower. Importantly, Friday’s closing price was lower than Thursday’s opening price. This is frequently a characteristic of a trend that is reversing. Sometimes the change of leadership from bulls to bears happens over an extended time-period. But sometimes it occurs in just one day. That could be the case here.",0.5201,NEGATIVE,0.9938

TSM investment.csv,"Does anyone have any opinions on if this is a good investment? Given the recent AI boom everyone is focused on big players such as NVIDIA and AMD, but they are both supplied heavily by TSM for their chips. I don’t see much competition for TSM given they are so far advanced ahead of any American or Chinese competitor, and given the only increase in demand for AI technology, I don’t see how they wouldn’t grow. Yes the stock is expensive right now, but given the growth opportunity I would argue there is still plenty of room for expansion. Yes, China is a threat, but something tells me that China would not dare suffer the economic sanctions western nations would impose if they made a move in Taiwan. Trump has said he would likely put tariffs on the Taiwan semiconductor industry in order to grow domestic production, but still with tariffs, I don’t see big players switching to alternatives, as the gap between TSM and alternatives is very large.

TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand.csv,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

Whenever i see them in the market, if NVIDIA is up 3%, they are up 6%, but if NVIDIA is down 3%, they are down 6-7%. Is it still a buy even though it has risen almost 50% this year?

Understand this about INTC.csv,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Which Quantum Stock to invest in Avoid QUBT.csv,"Following on from my recent DD on Quantum Computing Inc (QUBT), a lot of messages and a 70% rise in share price that has cooked my puts, I decided I'd dive a bit deeper QUBT does not have leading quantum physicists or innovation. Monroe has more talent in his pinky Similar to when evaluating biotechs, in the quantum computing industry you need to consider the academic and publishing background of employees. Quantum Computing is a pioneering area of science, innovations are typically borne out of research conducted by universities and research centres that are published and reviewed. As I explained in my past post, QUBT's staff did not attain their Phds at leading universities (something which is very important given the quantum computing academic field is relatively small and nascent). Furthermore, even if you thought they might be diamonds in the rough - their publication records indicate that they are abysmal researchers (see above). The citation count of QUBT's entire (quantum) employee count is unable to match the citation count of individual founders from competing firms. This is a clear indication that their 'innovations' and patents are likely to fail commercially. For every technical staff member at QUBT, there is $42million in market capitalisation. Bearish signal: Big capital raises and no hiring Furthermore, even if I was agnostic on education and publishing background, just from a headcount perspective, they do not have the people. They are the smallest of the four leading small cap quantum firms. And despite capital raises, including a recent $50 million capital raise and booming stock price, they have not shown signs of new hiring. The current market cap of $1.33 billion appears unsustainable, and works out to $42 million per technical staff member - that's more than my dad made in his entire life. Where has the money gone? If you believe what the company is saying, the money from their recent capital raises are going into a foundry dedicated to processing thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) chips for use in quantum computing. There are a number of commercial lithium niobate suppliers, and unlike what they claim on their website, suppliers do exist in countries other than China - see Switzerland, USA, UK. Given the relative obscurity of QUBT's employees, it is unlikely that they'll manage to either make functioning chips (which they are already falling behind on) or beat out their competitors who possess significantly more valuable patents, better manufacturing capability and greater commercial links (i.e. with Amazon, Nvidia, Google). Also here is what Quantum Computing Inc’s foundry looks like, which notably Iceberg Research exposed them for lying about its size. But would QUBT really mislead investors? QUBT has pivoted many times during its history: from beverage company, to quantum software, artificial intelligence, and now quantum chips. It naturally begs the question, should potential investors believe QUBT's claims?

This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings: Data Sources: SPY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Schwab, Yahoo Finance. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST) SFY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Zacks.com, Yahoo Finance. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST) Key Observations: Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting. It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation. I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors: Expense Ratio: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. Stock Selection Methodology: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. Performance Trends: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. Portfolio Diversification: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. Market Positioning: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. Innovative Approach of SoFi: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy. It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.

"Why Are Analysts Increasing NVIDIA’s Price Target Is It Out of Fear That Something Bad Will Happen, .csv","NVIDIA, often considered the heart of AI stocks, has recently been in the spotlight as analysts uniformly raise their stock targets.

AMD to acquire server builder ZT Systems for 49 billion in cash and stock.csv,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced on Monday its plans to acquire server manufacturer ZT Systems for $4.9 billion, as part of its strategy to bolster its portfolio of artificial intelligence (AI) chips and hardware, and to compete more effectively against Nvidia. The acquisition will be financed with 75% cash and the remaining in stock, leveraging AMD’s $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments reported in the second quarter. The rising demands of AI computing have necessitated the use of thousands of interconnected chips to achieve the required processing power, making the design and construction of server systems increasingly critical. This acquisition will enable AMD to enhance its capabilities in this area. According to AMD CEO Lisa Su, the addition of ZT Systems’ engineers will accelerate the company’s ability to test and deploy its latest AI GPUs on a scale required by major cloud computing companies like Microsoft. Although AMD plans to incorporate ZT Systems into its operations, it has no intention of competing directly in the server manufacturing market. Instead, the company plans to divest its server manufacturing business after the acquisition is finalized, with no discussions yet held with potential buyers. ZT Systems CEO Frank Zhang will join AMD, reporting to Forrest Norrod, AMD’s data center chief. The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2025, will see AMD retaining about 1,000 of ZT Systems' roughly 2,500 employees. AMD anticipates that the acquisition will positively impact its adjusted financial performance by the end of 2025.

AMZN Earnings Preview- What to watch for tonight.csv,"Earnings from Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. will be crucial in guiding the Nasdaq 100 after a volatile period marked by extreme fluctuations. As the last megacaps to release results before Nvidia Corp. in August, these reports will set the tone for tech investors, particularly focusing on how artificial intelligence is driving growth in Amazon’s cloud-computing unit and boosting demand for Apple's next iPhone. The results will also provide valuable insights into the health of consumer spending, with Amazon shares already up about 25% this year. Amazon.com Inc. is set to release its Q2 earnings report after the market closes, with a conference call scheduled for 5:30 p.m. ET. Analysts project the company will report revenue of $148.8 billion, marking an 11% increase year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up from 65 cents in the same period last year. Amazon has guided for Q2 operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, signaling strong performance despite broader economic challenges. Key metrics expected by analysts include AWS revenue at nearly $26 billion, representing more than 17% year-over-year growth, and advertising revenue projected to reach $13 billion, a 21.7% increase from last year. The Stores segment, bolstered by events like Prime Day, is anticipated to show significant activity, while improvements in operating margins, especially in the North America segment, will be closely watched. Analysts also expect updates on AI initiatives and the overall capital expenditures for the year. Comments from analysts emphasize the importance of AI and cloud services for Amazon's future growth. Citi analysts, led by Ronald Josey, anticipate AWS revenue growth accelerated in Q2 due to generative AI tailwinds, while also predicting a beat in operating income thanks to improved retail efficiencies and strong advertising demand. Truist analyst Youssef Squali highlights Amazon's ability to gain share in global e-commerce and sees multiple growth vectors powering the company's continued expansion. Retail performance and consumer spending trends will be significant indicators, especially given mixed reports this earnings season. Analysts like Matt Stucky of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management note the importance of Amazon's retail margin expansion and its impact on profitability. Additionally, the potential for a surprise dividend announcement is a point of interest, as Amazon remains the last major tech company without a dividend program. Amazon's Q2 results will follow earnings reports from key competitors like Microsoft and Google, both of which had mixed receptions based on their cloud and AI performances. Wall Street's current focus is on tangible returns from AI investments, making Amazon's updates on its AI initiatives and AWS growth crucial for investor sentiment. The company's dominant position in the cloud market and ongoing efforts to enhance its e-commerce offerings will be under the microscope. Amazon saw its stock rise following a strong Q1 earnings report, showcasing impressive upside in both EPS and revenue. The standout metric was a significant 221% year-over-year increase in operating income to $15.31 billion, far surpassing the prior guidance of $8-12 billion. The company’s guidance for Q2 operating income of $10-14 billion also exceeded expectations. The Stores segment performed well, driven by successful shopping events like Amazon's Spring Deal Days in Europe and the first Big Spring Sale in Canada and the US. Faster delivery times, enhanced by regionalization efforts and cost-saving measures such as consolidating units into fewer boxes, boosted customer purchase frequency and overall spend. Additionally, Amazon is preparing for its 10th Prime Day event in July, which is expected to further drive sales. Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the highlight of the quarter, with a 17% growth in constant currency, an improvement from previous quarters. AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue business, with significant growth in both generative and non-generative AI workloads. The Advertising Services segment also showed robust growth, with a 24% increase in revenue to $11.82 billion, driven primarily by sponsored ads and early gains in Prime Video ads. Despite guiding Q2 revenue below consensus due to foreign exchange impacts, the strong performance in AWS and advertising has left investors optimistic.",0.5699,POSITIVE,0.9923

Some of it just recovered from 2022 to it's pre-2022 state, but Nvidia has 205% growth this year, which is crazy Index funds - the legendary S&P 500. Everyone says it's the most stable etc - but I've found other indexes with even better growth. SP500 usually have the 7-10% yearly return and last 5 years went up 56%, but for example the INDEX Vanguard Growth ETF went up 87% for the last 5 years - and it was also a steady growth, not a lucky spike during one period. What do you think, is it really smart to go with SP500 or are there other ones that are much better, even tho SP500 is so hyped by everyone? and if you agree - what other indexes with better return would you recommend? Leverage - I'm not familiar with how much can you leverage in stocks, but for people that invest in the top 10, which most likely will go up in the future, wouldn't be smarter to invest it with i.e 5x leverage, since the companies like Microsoft are stable, and eventually will grow? Stock Math - let's say I invest $10.000 in a stock and it declines -50%. I know have $5.000. If it goes up by 50%, do I get $7.500 or do I get my $10.000 back?

Dell Earnings.csv,"I wanted to get everyone’s take on DELL (down nearly 11% after hours.) I bought 106 shares at 130.5 during their recent run. Didn’t sell today because I like their growth prospects wanted to exit around $150. The company seems solid, especially with its strength in enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure, even though consumer PC sales have been an ongoing problem. Despite this Dell has been doubling down on AI, data centers, and hybrid cloud, which I believe should set them up well for growth in 2025. They also stand to benefit from SMCI’s issues and Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure. With the growing focus on AI and enterprise tech, it feels like Dell could see steady, long-term growth and break out to that $150 range by Q2 2024. Thoughts? Should I continue to hold?

"Feds set stage for antitrust probes of Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI.csv","The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are nearing an agreement to divvy up investigations of potential anticompetitive conduct by some of the world’s largest technology companies in the artificial intelligence industry, according to three people with knowledge of the negotiations. As part of the arrangement, the DOJ is poised to investigate Nvidia and its leading position in supplying the high-end semiconductors underpinning AI computing, while the FTC is set to probe whether Microsoft, and its partner OpenAI, have unfair advantages with the rapidly evolving technology, particularly around the technology used for large language models. The three companies have been leaders in AI, with the technology powering Nvidia today to a $3 trillion market value, second only to Microsoft. The deal has been negotiated for nearly a year. And while leaders of both agencies have expressed urgency in ensuring that the rapidly growing artificial intelligence technology is not dominated by existing tech giants, until an agreement is finalized, there was very little investigative work they could do.

Fundamentals behind a USA market drop this week & some positives.csv,"The problem areas in the USA: -------------------------- *- The Schiller PE is at a very high level. Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble. So stocks are highly expensive. *- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022! We are more of a service economy than a goods economy, *- World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle. That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local sales declines are offset. Additionally the trade war hampers both sides. *- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels. *- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers. You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term. People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank. However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials. AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth. AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales. So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia. This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW. I don't own any MKSI. This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording. So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN. Good areas: -------------------------------------- *- Labor productivity is up consistently since Q3 2022. one can see tradingeconomics dot com USA productivity *- Gasoline is lower than last year *- Retail sales are going fine, [ per a recent NPR radio article ] Nuetral ---------------------------------------- *- Labor force participation is not higher than Sept 2023. No more sales growth from people returning to work. Participation is up recently. tradingeconomics has this info. *- Consumer confidence is still down since January 2020.

Liz Ann Sonders, Chief Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab, pointed out that beneath the surface, the average stock in the Nasdaq has experienced a 37% drawdown, compared to the 7% maximum drawdown of the index from its year-to-date high.

"Impacting NVDA is underlying logic,what does OpenAI is change in strategy mean.csv","Big model pre-training bottleneck: Silicon Valley AI labs are generally struggling with new model training, with OpenAI's Orion and Google's Gemini 2.0 failing to significantly outperform their predecessors, defying the “law of scaling”. This law used to mean that model performance would continue to increase with data and computation, but the scaling effect has now plateaued. Computing in the reasoning phase: To overcome pre-training bottlenecks, OpenAI and other labs are exploring “compute on test” techniques that enable human-like multi-step reasoning by allowing models to generate and evaluate multiple possibilities in real-time during the reasoning phase. This approach can be used more effectively for complex tasks such as mathematics and coding to optimize reasoning performance. Hardware Demand Shift: Market demand is likely to shift from large-scale pre-training clusters to inference clouds as new technologies reduce parameter requirements. This will weaken NVIDIA's monopoly in the training chip market, and the inference chip market may see more competition, especially as companies such as Groq may fill the new demand. Capital Trends: Venture capital organizations are highly concerned about this change, and are gradually investing more resources in distributed inference clouds to cater to the distributed server needs of inference computing.",0.5346,POSITIVE,0.6048

Intel potential comeback.csv,"Hey! Intel seems like a company that's really struggling right now. Their stock just dropped to around $20.16, and it’s not just the GPU market giving them trouble. They’re battling issues on multiple fronts. First off, their foundry business (where they manufacture chips) is bleeding money – about $7 billion in annual losses! They’re not expected to break even there until at least 2027. On top of that, they’re losing market share to AMD and Nvidia, both in CPUs and GPUs. Nvidia is dominating with AI, and AMD is taking more and more of the gaming market. It also feels like they completely missed the whole AI boom. Nvidia is raking in insane profits, while Intel seems to be… just watching? And to make things worse, their CEO recently stepped down, which makes their future even more uncertain. That said, they’ve just launched their new Arc B580 and B570 budget GPUs. Nvidia and AMD seem more focused on AI and data centers right now, so maybe Intel has a shot at carving out a space in gaming? But is that really enough to turn things around? What do you guys think?

Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,NEGATIVE,0.9443

Hi! I’m Dan Howley, the tech editor at Yahoo Finance, and Nvidia has seemingly been at the forefront of virtually everything I’ve covered since ChatGPT hit the scene in 2022. I’ve been covering the tech space for 13 years and tracking Nvidia for even longer. I built my first desktop PC with an Nvidia graphics card in high school and have continued using its products ever since. Now I, like everyone else, am focused on Nvidia’s AI efforts, from reporting on how they’re dealing with the threat of increased competition to attending the company’s GTC conference to chatting with CEO Jensen Huang alongside my colleague Julie Hyman. With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia’s chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like AMD are gaining steam, and Nvidia’s own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant. How that plays out over the next few years is anyone’s guess. In today’s fiscal 2025 third quarter earnings report, Nvidia beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines on the strength of sales of its high-powered AI chips. 💵 Revenue: $35.08B vs $33.2B expected 💲 Adjusted EPS: $0.81 vs $0.74 expected 💾 Data center revenue: $30.8B vs $29B expected Nvidia also said it anticipates revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, for the fiscal fourth quarter.

Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&P 500 gains.csv,"= just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing = The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023 https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9 The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions. It’s an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve’s inflation battle, noted FactSet’s Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post. The 10 top performing days for the S&P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%. The S&P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday’s close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%. Through Dec. 22, the S&P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%. Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said. That didn’t mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote. Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found. Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July. The strategy “indicates the Fed’s measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,” Jakobsen said. The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks’ bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group’s announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering. SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a “mini” banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown. Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks — Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78% , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, 0.16%, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%, Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%, Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%, and Meta Platforms Inc. META, 0.56%. See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024? Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind. The S&P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted. In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high: The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&P 500’s weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted. Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&P 500’s overall return, he wrote, with the company’s success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.",0.5482,NEGATIVE,0.9995
Mega-caps vs small caps.csv,"The current state of the stock market exhibits a stark contrast between the performance of mega-cap and small-cap stocks, as investors grapple with mixed signals from major corporations and broader market indices.  Recent developments have highlighted this divide, with Microsoft's upcoming earnings report set to further shape the narrative. Mega-Cap Weakness and Market Impact Microsoft, a key player in the technology sector, is set to report its earnings after the market close, and its performance could significantly influence investor sentiment.  The recent underperformance of large-cap stocks like Merck and Procter & Gamble, both of which have disappointed with earnings guidance, has contributed to the Nasdaq Composite's (-0.9%) and S&P 500's (-0.4%) downward pressure.  This weakness is reflected in the Vanguard Mega-Cap Growth ETF (MGK), which is down 1.1%. Small-Cap Resilience In contrast, small-cap stocks have shown relative strength, with the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 Value Index posting gains.  The equal-weighted S&P 500 is also holding its own, indicating that smaller companies are providing a stabilizing force in the market.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, buoyed by the financials and energy sectors, adds to this resilience. Sectors in Focus The IT sector, weighed down by NVIDIA's (-5.0%) decline ahead of AMD's earnings release, is leading the pack of losers.  Consumer staples, also negatively impacted, are lagging behind. On the other hand, financials, and energy sectors are posting gains, offering a glimmer of hope for investors seeking opportunities. Treasuries and Market Sentiment The Treasury market remains relatively calm, with the 2-yr note yield down to 4.38% and the 10-yr note yield at 4.17%.  Economic indicators, such as the better-than-expected consumer confidence index and the Bank of Japan's policy decision, have not sparked significant market movements, suggesting that investors are cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's FOMC decision on Wednesday. As we await Microsoft's earnings report, the stock market's divide between mega-cap and small-cap stocks is a cause for concern, especially for those relying on large-cap performance.  However, the resilience of small-cap companies and select sectors is providing a silver lining. Investors should stay vigilant, monitor market reactions to key earnings releases, and consider a diversified portfolio that takes into account the current market dynamics.  The Federal Reserve's decision will likely play a crucial role in determining the market's next course of action.",0.5419,NEGATIVE,0.9136

MSFT faces long-term potential disadvantages.csv,"I think one of the main reasons Microsoft is a great long-term investment is its long history of generating a lot of free cash flow. At the time of writing, the company's free cash flow margin is over 30%, with free cash flow rising from $15.9 billion in 2009 to $74.1 billion in the last 12 months. This financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments. While Microsoft may not seem like a value investment, in my opinion, its pricing is reasonable given its continued revenue and earnings growth, and it's likely to continue for the foreseeable future. I estimate EPS growth of 13% on a regular basis over the next 12 months. Based on this projection, I have a price target of $482.40 and estimate that the stock will trade at a non-GAAP P/E ratio of around 36. Looking ahead, I expect Microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15% over the next 5 to 10 years. While this prospect necessitates buying the stock at a fair valuation, I believe the current price provides an opportunity. The company's forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is only 6.5% above its five-year average, while its forward diluted earnings per share growth rate is nearly the same at 5.8%. MSFT faces long-term potential headwinds One potential challenge to Microsoft's long-term growth in AI is that its adoption can be cyclical. Currently, the demand for AI systems is high, which has prompted Microsoft and other big tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion. However, when the current trend peaks (likely due to macroeconomic constraints), growth may slow. According to the TipRanks risk analysis tool, Microsoft is exposed to 32% risk from legal and regulatory factors, which is higher than the industry average and could impact its AI operations due to increased scrutiny of data privacy and AI governance. Given this outlook, I expect some volatility in Microsoft's long-term growth trajectory, although it may not be as good as NVIDIA NVDA -0.06% ▼ and so on semiconductor companies so obvious. As market sentiment fluctuates, cyclical price and valuation declines coincide with temporarily lower growth rates and may provide more attractive buying opportunities. There is also a risk that Microsoft and other Big Tech players could over-invest in AI infrastructure. With 21% of its risk related to Tech & Innovation, Microsoft’s heavy investment in AI-driven initiatives, including data center infrastructure, could result in lower-than-expected returns if industry growth does not meet expectations. This may impact free cash flow margins in the medium term, contributing to further volatility.",0.5607,NEGATIVE,0.8794

Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is on a path to exceed its earnings expectations next month when its Q3 report comes out. While an earnings beat is not fully guaranteed, the latest earnings results of the company’s peers, suppliers, clients, and businesses that have a connection to the generative AI industry point to Nvidia having a stellar performance in Q3. The demand for its AI GPUs remains high, the company has been receiving upward revisions recently, and its stock is trading around its all-time high levels with a potential to appreciate even further in the upcoming months.

Nvidia announces 50 billion stock buyback.csv,"Nvidia said Wednesday that its board of directors has approved a $50 billion stock buyback. The computer chip giant announced the share repurchase as part of its fiscal second-quarter earnings, in which it reported earnings and guidance that surpassed Wall Street expectations. Nvidia returned $15.4 billion to shareholders in share repurposes and cash dividends as part of the company’s first half of its fiscal 2025. The company said it had $7.5 billion remaining under its share repurchase plan, as of the end of its fiscal second quarter. Last year, Nvidia announced a $25 billion share buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results. Companies often experience a boom to their stock price after revealing stock buyback plans. In May, for instance, Apple announced a $110 billion stock buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results that showed overall sales fell 4% year over year and iPhone sales dropped 10% year over year. However, the iPhone maker’s shares rose 7% in after-hours trading, likely because Apple’s share buyback was the biggest in corporate history. With Nvidia’s shares dropping 4% in extended trading despite reporting solid financial results and announcing a stock buyback, some experts believe the company has been doing so well that it is getting harder to impress investors.

Nvidia More Room to Run Just Getting Started.csv,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they’ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don’t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical. Yes, Nvidia’s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn’t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now. Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn’t possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia’s place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn’t happened and Nvidia’s only gotten stronger. That’s not to say over time Nvidia won’t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it’s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution. Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations. I don’t think AI is a bubble but I do think that Nvidia and the market as a whole can get ahead of themselves.

"Nvidia reports earnings, Fed gathers in Jackson Hole What about this week.csv","In the final week of August, investors will be focused on two major events: Nvidia's earnings and the Federal Reserve's annual meeting in Jackson Hole. The Jackson Hole Economic Symposium will kick off on Thursday, with Fed Chair Jay Powell's address serving as the major event. Powell's comments on interest rates, the economy, and any indication that inflationary pressures are driving a reassessment of the Fed's present aims will be scrutinized. On the corporate front, Nvidia headlines the earnings story this week, with the chipmaker scheduled to publish data from a quarter that caused the chipmaker to increase its revenue forecast by 50%. Lowe's, BJ's Wholesale Club, and Peloton are also set to announce earnings this week. August is shaping up to be the worst month for stocks this year, with all three main averages closing last week lower after a hawkish read of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting sent equities lower and Treasury rates higher in the second half of the week. Economic data continues to come in stronger than expected, with the July retail sales report indicating a 0.7% increase in sales for the month, about double what economists forecast. The AtlantaFed's GDPNow projection now predicts third-quarter GDP growth of 5.8%, the strongest rate since the fourth quarter of 2021. Inflation has declined dramatically since Powell's Jackson Hole speech last year, when he predicted rates will climb until the ""job is done,"" lowering inflation. Powell has stated as recently as July that inflation is ""well above"" the Fed's long-run objective of 2%. On the corporate front, all eyes will be on Nvidia, which predicted that artificial intelligence demand will increase its current quarter sales projection from $7 billion to $11 billion. Nvidia stock is up about 200% year to date, but its gains have slowed along with the market since mid-July.

Qualcomm Approached Intel About a Takeover in Recent Days.csv,"Qualcomm recently approached Intel with a takeover proposal, marking what could be one of the largest tech deals in recent memory, according to sources. Intel, once valued at over $290 billion, has seen its market cap fall to around $90 billion after a challenging year in which its shares dropped 60%. While a deal is far from guaranteed, Qualcomm’s interest comes as Intel struggles to recover under CEO Pat Gelsinger’s turnaround plan, which has yet to deliver significant results. Should Intel be receptive, the deal could face heavy antitrust scrutiny, though some argue it might bolster U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor industry. Qualcomm may consider offloading parts of Intel to complete the acquisition. Both companies have sought to capitalize on the AI boom, though they’ve lagged behind Nvidia. Intel, grappling with factory delays and cost-cutting measures, is receiving government subsidies as part of its efforts to build chip factories. A Qualcomm takeover could enhance its portfolio by adding Intel’s dominance in PCs and servers to its smartphone chip business. Despite this potential merger, Intel continues to face major hurdles, including the possible need to split its design and manufacturing operations amid growing calls for the company to separate its business divisions.

And it's been going pretty decent however recently I got a couple of August 30th calls for Nvidia I managed to get in at a good position for 133 calls. My thesis is that it's going to keep pumping up to the day of earnings. I don't have any intention of holding the position up until expiration. My question is regarding theta decay and volatility. I know that the closer I got to the expiration the less profit I'll see as a percentage of my position. And I also understand that during high levels of volatility it can go both ways. And I'm not really asking for specific advice just kind of guidance or knowledge as to how that may affect my position. I'm holding them over the weekend and I'm expecting Monday to start off a little red but to finish off green and so I'm not quite sure if I want to sell half my positions and wait till earnings or if I should wait to earnings in general. I strongly believe that Nvidia is going to beat their earnings I just don't know how drastically that's going to affect the price action. Any and all input is definitely appreciated Thanks in advance,0.5421,NEGATIVE,0.9936

Super Micro Falls as Hindenburg Takes Aim With Short Report.csv,"Super Micro Computer Inc.'s shares took a hit on Tuesday following a short report from Hindenburg Research that questioned the company's financial practices and transparency. Hindenburg's report alleged significant accounting red flags, undisclosed related-party transactions, and potential violations of sanctions and export controls. Initially, the report caused Super Micro's stock to plummet by as much as 8.7%, but it later rebounded to close down 2.6%. The server manufacturer has been a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, with its high-performance servers in high demand for data centers. This surge in AI-related demand has driven significant growth for the company, doubling its revenue to $14.9 billion in the most recent fiscal year. Despite a steep decline from its March peak, Super Micro's stock remains up over 90% for the year, reflecting continued investor interest in the burgeoning AI sector. However, the Hindenburg report could intensify scrutiny on Super Micro's accounting practices and client relationships, particularly as the company has faced regulatory challenges in the past. In 2020, Super Micro resolved a U.S. SEC investigation by correcting its financial statements and paying a penalty for accounting issues from 2014 to 2017. As the AI market continues to expand, maintaining investor confidence will be crucial for Super Micro, especially amid concerns about the profitability of AI-optimized servers and the potential for increased regulatory oversight.

Technical Analysis Lesson - Reversal Day in Nvidia (NVDA).csv,"Every trader wants to know when the trend is changing from up to down or down to up. This happens when the leadership in the market changes from bulls to bears or bears to bulls. These trend changes are what every trader looks for. If they can accurately predict market turns, they can profit. That’s why they do what they do. Sometimes this change of leadership is slow and takes a long period of time to happen. These changes have price action that tends to show up on a chart as a ‘Rounded Top’ or ‘Rounded Bottom’ pattern. Sometimes the reversal is abrupt and takes place over a few time periods. This action tends to show up on a chart as a ‘V’ or ‘Inverted V’ reversal. But sometimes the trend changes just in one day... These dynamics can show up on a chart as a ‘Reversal Day’ pattern. One may have just happened in the stock of Nivida (NVDA). The Western world would call it an ‘Outside Reversal Day’. In candlestick terminology, it is called a ‘Bearish Engulfing Pattern’. It’s important to note that these candlestick patterns are at least 700 years old. They were developed by Japanese rice traders. It shows that the human nature which is illustrated in charts hasn’t changed. The name doesn’t matter. The action that it illustrates does. On Friday morning, it looked as though the uptrend in NVDA was going to continue for yet another day. It opened at a higher price than Thursday’s close. But then the tide turned… Over the day, the sellers came out of the woodwork. And not only did they hold off the assault. They overpowered the buyers and eventually pushed the price much lower. Importantly, Friday’s closing price was lower than Thursday’s opening price. This is frequently a characteristic of a trend that is reversing. Sometimes the change of leadership from bulls to bears happens over an extended time-period. But sometimes it occurs in just one day. That could be the case here.",0.5201,NEGATIVE,0.9938

TSM investment.csv,"Does anyone have any opinions on if this is a good investment? Given the recent AI boom everyone is focused on big players such as NVIDIA and AMD, but they are both supplied heavily by TSM for their chips. I don’t see much competition for TSM given they are so far advanced ahead of any American or Chinese competitor, and given the only increase in demand for AI technology, I don’t see how they wouldn’t grow. Yes the stock is expensive right now, but given the growth opportunity I would argue there is still plenty of room for expansion. Yes, China is a threat, but something tells me that China would not dare suffer the economic sanctions western nations would impose if they made a move in Taiwan. Trump has said he would likely put tariffs on the Taiwan semiconductor industry in order to grow domestic production, but still with tariffs, I don’t see big players switching to alternatives, as the gap between TSM and alternatives is very large.

TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand.csv,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

Understand this about INTC.csv,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Which Quantum Stock to invest in Avoid QUBT.csv,"Following on from my recent DD on Quantum Computing Inc (QUBT), a lot of messages and a 70% rise in share price that has cooked my puts, I decided I'd dive a bit deeper QUBT does not have leading quantum physicists or innovation. Monroe has more talent in his pinky Similar to when evaluating biotechs, in the quantum computing industry you need to consider the academic and publishing background of employees. Quantum Computing is a pioneering area of science, innovations are typically borne out of research conducted by universities and research centres that are published and reviewed. As I explained in my past post, QUBT's staff did not attain their Phds at leading universities (something which is very important given the quantum computing academic field is relatively small and nascent). Furthermore, even if you thought they might be diamonds in the rough - their publication records indicate that they are abysmal researchers (see above). The citation count of QUBT's entire (quantum) employee count is unable to match the citation count of individual founders from competing firms. This is a clear indication that their 'innovations' and patents are likely to fail commercially. For every technical staff member at QUBT, there is $42million in market capitalisation. Bearish signal: Big capital raises and no hiring Furthermore, even if I was agnostic on education and publishing background, just from a headcount perspective, they do not have the people. They are the smallest of the four leading small cap quantum firms. And despite capital raises, including a recent $50 million capital raise and booming stock price, they have not shown signs of new hiring. The current market cap of $1.33 billion appears unsustainable, and works out to $42 million per technical staff member - that's more than my dad made in his entire life. Where has the money gone? If you believe what the company is saying, the money from their recent capital raises are going into a foundry dedicated to processing thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) chips for use in quantum computing. There are a number of commercial lithium niobate suppliers, and unlike what they claim on their website, suppliers do exist in countries other than China - see Switzerland, USA, UK. Given the relative obscurity of QUBT's employees, it is unlikely that they'll manage to either make functioning chips (which they are already falling behind on) or beat out their competitors who possess significantly more valuable patents, better manufacturing capability and greater commercial links (i.e. with Amazon, Nvidia, Google). Also here is what Quantum Computing Inc’s foundry looks like, which notably Iceberg Research exposed them for lying about its size. But would QUBT really mislead investors? QUBT has pivoted many times during its history: from beverage company, to quantum software, artificial intelligence, and now quantum chips. It naturally begs the question, should potential investors believe QUBT's claims?

Why am I bullish on SFY instead of SPY.csv,"A comparison analysis between the holdings of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY), I have compiled information from the most recent available data. Below is a table showing the top 10 holdings for each ETF along with their percentage weight in the respective ETFs. This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings: Data Sources: SPY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Schwab, Yahoo Finance. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST) SFY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Zacks.com, Yahoo Finance. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST) Key Observations: Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting. It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation. I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors: Expense Ratio: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. Stock Selection Methodology: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. Performance Trends: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. Portfolio Diversification: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. Market Positioning: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. Innovative Approach of SoFi: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy. It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.

I'm simply going the negative route, in a slow and systematic manner, without any huge trigger events. What am I missing and at what dates that's important and could also add to this? If you notice in the prior post list, three out of six times... rising interest rates were part of the cause that brought the market down at least 20%. Oil price shocks two out of 6. Then there´s speculative investments at the dotcom bubble. Covid, overvaluation, trade tensions... Stagflation. So these have to be in the mix one way or another: Cocktail Potential Ingredients: Rising interest rates. Oil price shocks. Speculative tech investments. Overvaluation. Trade tensions. Stagflation. New round of Covid-19. Housing or Commercial Real Estate Bubble. So this is the speculative worse case scenario we could have without going as far as having a WWIII: February 13, 2024: CPI report comes in hot. S&P500 comes down 1.5%, some buy the tiny dip. February 15, 2024: Jobless claims rise. Doesn't alter the market but adds to the cocktail mix. February 16, 2024: A higher-than-expected PPI indicates increasing costs at the producer level, which can signal rising inflationary pressures. Producers might pass these higher costs onto consumers, leading to an increase in consumer prices and overall inflation. The Fed to consider tightening monetary policy more aggressively than previously anticipated to combat inflation. This could include raising interest rates or adjusting the pace of tapering asset purchases. Financial markets don't react negatively to a higher-than-expected PPI, as it they priced it in from the CPI report. February 21, 2024: Nvidia posts earnings, they actually do fine but investors realize that´s gonna be the ceiling for now so the stock falls 15%. Other tech stocks get stained by the fear, bringing the S&P500 2.5% lower. AI investment sentiments leans towards potentially speculative for now. March 12, 2024: February´s CPI report comes in hot again, causing Algorithmic trades to sell and bring down the S&P500 another 2%. March 19-20, 2024: FOMC Meeting gives subtext of potentially not bringing interest rates down yet. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterates emphasis on the central bank's commitment to combating inflation, even if it requires keeping interest rates high for an extended period. This brings down the market sentiment down and numbers another 1%. April 5, 2024: In a CNBC YouTube video report, experts delve into the complexities of the current commercial real estate (CRE) market. The rise of remote work led to a decreased demand for office spaces, the pandemic trained people to make purchases online, commercial real estate bubble starts to show symptoms of cracking up. April 10, 2024: CPI report is on ambiguous. Not up, not down. Anything could happen at this point. Aprils report will define what the FED will do and the next 6 months of stock market activity. Market loses .5% April 17, 2024: Tom Lee's bullish perspective has been challenged by the prior events and during an interview he mentions that this was the turmoil he had been expecting but sees the S&P500 going back to 5,200 points by the end of the year. Currently at 4,600... 7.5% below all time highs. May 1, 2024: FOMC Meeting leaves a bad taste in mouth. Jerome shifts narrative towards not lowering interests rates yet. Market falls another 2.5% on the bad sentiment. May 15, 2024: Situations in the Middle East, such as tensions in Gaza or Iran, could impact global oil supplies by affecting regional stability and energy infrastructure. Saudi Arabia, a key OPEC member, might alter its oil production strategy in response to shifts in global politics, economic pressures, or changes in energy demand. Actions perceived as irrational could stem from strategic decisions to protect national interests, influence oil prices, or respond to international events. S&P500 falls 0.5%. July 8, 2024: A new wave of Covid-19 actually breaks through the collective deceit of it being over because death rates rise significantly and word spreads out again from hospital staff that's it's getting real bad. Stock market reacts in a mixed manner. Amazon and tech companies go up a little, small caps enter another bad rout. S&P500 falls 1%. July 20, 2024: Numbers start to confirm a Stagflation situation actually taking place. A significant slowdown in economic growth, rising unemployment rates, declining consumer spending, and a contraction in manufacturing. Inflation pressures, coupled with tightening monetary policies aimed at controlling price levels, contribute to decreased economic activity. Additionally, geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions serve as catalysts, further straining global markets. The interconnectedness of these factors in precipitate a recessionary environment. S&P500 falls .7%. July 23, 2024: Nvidia reports and disappoints, falls another 8% in tandem with other tech companies. July 25, 2024: Commercial Real Estate bubble pops and hits the news hard. S&P500 falls 1.4% At 13.6% the all time highs from January 2024. Currently at 4,400 points. August 14, 2024: After all the earnings reports it becomes increasingly clear: the FED won't lower rates and will keep them there for longer than expected; consumer spending is declining, companies keep firing people, the Bear narrative takes over. The S&P500 falls to 4,010 points. 23.5% below all time highs. It stays around here for the next 6 months, falls further and gets better by the end of 2025.",0.5298,NEGATIVE,1.0

Microsoft is privy to specific data regarding demand and metrics for OpenAI’s consumer and enterprise solutions, which serves as a crucial indicator of AI sentiment, second only to Nvidia. Remember the partnership with Apple? 2. AMD’s Earnings Report: AMD has projected significant demand and growth, suggesting a positive trend. If AMD is experiencing this level of demand, it’s worth considering what Nvidia might be experiencing. AMD indicated no signs of slowing down in AI product demand through 2025 and beyond.

Quarterly Highlights: • Earnings per share: 69 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected • Revenue: $5.83 billion vs. $5.72 billion expected • Expected Q3 Sales: $6.7 billion vs. $6.61 billion expected Financial Performance: • Net Income: $265 million (16 cents per share) vs. $27 million (2 cents per share) YoY • Data Center Revenue: Grew 115% YoY to $2.8 billion, driven by AI chip sales (Instinct GPUs) • Client Segment (PCs): Rose 49% YoY to $1.5 billion, indicating a recovering PC market • Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% YoY, below the expected $676 million • Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% YoY, slightly above the expected $856 million AMD’s AI chip sales, reported under the Data Center segment, saw significant growth, highlighting the company’s efforts to compete with Nvidia. AMD’s MI300X AI chip aims to capture market share from Nvidia, which has seen its stock double this year due to high demand for AI GPUs. Despite a challenging year with shares down 6% in 2024, AMD remains the second-largest vendor of data center GPUs, trailing Nvidia. Investors are focused on AMD’s ability to grow its AI business, with the company anticipating $4 billion in AI chip sales this year, accounting for 15% of its total expected sales. AMD’s core business in CPUs for laptops and servers and its growing AI chip segment position the company as a significant player in the evolving technology landscape.

AMD to acquire server builder ZT Systems for 49 billion in cash and stock.csv,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced on Monday its plans to acquire server manufacturer ZT Systems for $4.9 billion, as part of its strategy to bolster its portfolio of artificial intelligence (AI) chips and hardware, and to compete more effectively against Nvidia. The acquisition will be financed with 75% cash and the remaining in stock, leveraging AMD’s $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments reported in the second quarter. The rising demands of AI computing have necessitated the use of thousands of interconnected chips to achieve the required processing power, making the design and construction of server systems increasingly critical. This acquisition will enable AMD to enhance its capabilities in this area. According to AMD CEO Lisa Su, the addition of ZT Systems’ engineers will accelerate the company’s ability to test and deploy its latest AI GPUs on a scale required by major cloud computing companies like Microsoft. Although AMD plans to incorporate ZT Systems into its operations, it has no intention of competing directly in the server manufacturing market. Instead, the company plans to divest its server manufacturing business after the acquisition is finalized, with no discussions yet held with potential buyers. ZT Systems CEO Frank Zhang will join AMD, reporting to Forrest Norrod, AMD’s data center chief. The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2025, will see AMD retaining about 1,000 of ZT Systems' roughly 2,500 employees. AMD anticipates that the acquisition will positively impact its adjusted financial performance by the end of 2025.

AMZN Earnings Preview- What to watch for tonight.csv,"Earnings from Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. will be crucial in guiding the Nasdaq 100 after a volatile period marked by extreme fluctuations. As the last megacaps to release results before Nvidia Corp. in August, these reports will set the tone for tech investors, particularly focusing on how artificial intelligence is driving growth in Amazon’s cloud-computing unit and boosting demand for Apple's next iPhone. The results will also provide valuable insights into the health of consumer spending, with Amazon shares already up about 25% this year. Amazon.com Inc. is set to release its Q2 earnings report after the market closes, with a conference call scheduled for 5:30 p.m. ET. Analysts project the company will report revenue of $148.8 billion, marking an 11% increase year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up from 65 cents in the same period last year. Amazon has guided for Q2 operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, signaling strong performance despite broader economic challenges. Key metrics expected by analysts include AWS revenue at nearly $26 billion, representing more than 17% year-over-year growth, and advertising revenue projected to reach $13 billion, a 21.7% increase from last year. The Stores segment, bolstered by events like Prime Day, is anticipated to show significant activity, while improvements in operating margins, especially in the North America segment, will be closely watched. Analysts also expect updates on AI initiatives and the overall capital expenditures for the year. Comments from analysts emphasize the importance of AI and cloud services for Amazon's future growth. Citi analysts, led by Ronald Josey, anticipate AWS revenue growth accelerated in Q2 due to generative AI tailwinds, while also predicting a beat in operating income thanks to improved retail efficiencies and strong advertising demand. Truist analyst Youssef Squali highlights Amazon's ability to gain share in global e-commerce and sees multiple growth vectors powering the company's continued expansion. Retail performance and consumer spending trends will be significant indicators, especially given mixed reports this earnings season. Analysts like Matt Stucky of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management note the importance of Amazon's retail margin expansion and its impact on profitability. Additionally, the potential for a surprise dividend announcement is a point of interest, as Amazon remains the last major tech company without a dividend program. Amazon's Q2 results will follow earnings reports from key competitors like Microsoft and Google, both of which had mixed receptions based on their cloud and AI performances. Wall Street's current focus is on tangible returns from AI investments, making Amazon's updates on its AI initiatives and AWS growth crucial for investor sentiment. The company's dominant position in the cloud market and ongoing efforts to enhance its e-commerce offerings will be under the microscope. Amazon saw its stock rise following a strong Q1 earnings report, showcasing impressive upside in both EPS and revenue. The standout metric was a significant 221% year-over-year increase in operating income to $15.31 billion, far surpassing the prior guidance of $8-12 billion. The company’s guidance for Q2 operating income of $10-14 billion also exceeded expectations. The Stores segment performed well, driven by successful shopping events like Amazon's Spring Deal Days in Europe and the first Big Spring Sale in Canada and the US. Faster delivery times, enhanced by regionalization efforts and cost-saving measures such as consolidating units into fewer boxes, boosted customer purchase frequency and overall spend. Additionally, Amazon is preparing for its 10th Prime Day event in July, which is expected to further drive sales. Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the highlight of the quarter, with a 17% growth in constant currency, an improvement from previous quarters. AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue business, with significant growth in both generative and non-generative AI workloads. The Advertising Services segment also showed robust growth, with a 24% increase in revenue to $11.82 billion, driven primarily by sponsored ads and early gains in Prime Video ads. Despite guiding Q2 revenue below consensus due to foreign exchange impacts, the strong performance in AWS and advertising has left investors optimistic.",0.5699,POSITIVE,0.9923

Some of it just recovered from 2022 to it's pre-2022 state, but Nvidia has 205% growth this year, which is crazy Index funds - the legendary S&P 500. Everyone says it's the most stable etc - but I've found other indexes with even better growth. SP500 usually have the 7-10% yearly return and last 5 years went up 56%, but for example the INDEX Vanguard Growth ETF went up 87% for the last 5 years - and it was also a steady growth, not a lucky spike during one period. What do you think, is it really smart to go with SP500 or are there other ones that are much better, even tho SP500 is so hyped by everyone? and if you agree - what other indexes with better return would you recommend? Leverage - I'm not familiar with how much can you leverage in stocks, but for people that invest in the top 10, which most likely will go up in the future, wouldn't be smarter to invest it with i.e 5x leverage, since the companies like Microsoft are stable, and eventually will grow? Stock Math - let's say I invest $10.000 in a stock and it declines -50%. I know have $5.000. If it goes up by 50%, do I get $7.500 or do I get my $10.000 back?

Dell Earnings.csv,"I wanted to get everyone’s take on DELL (down nearly 11% after hours.) I bought 106 shares at 130.5 during their recent run.

The company seems solid, especially with its strength in enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure, even though consumer PC sales have been an ongoing problem. Despite this Dell has been doubling down on AI, data centers, and hybrid cloud, which I believe should set them up well for growth in 2025. They also stand to benefit from SMCI’s issues and Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure. With the growing focus on AI and enterprise tech, it feels like Dell could see steady, long-term growth and break out to that $150 range by Q2 2024. Thoughts? Should I continue to hold?

As part of the arrangement, the DOJ is poised to investigate Nvidia and its leading position in supplying the high-end semiconductors underpinning AI computing, while the FTC is set to probe whether Microsoft, and its partner OpenAI, have unfair advantages with the rapidly evolving technology, particularly around the technology used for large language models. The three companies have been leaders in AI, with the technology powering Nvidia today to a $3 trillion market value, second only to Microsoft. The deal has been negotiated for nearly a year. And while leaders of both agencies have expressed urgency in ensuring that the rapidly growing artificial intelligence technology is not dominated by existing tech giants, until an agreement is finalized, there was very little investigative work they could do.

Fundamentals behind a USA market drop this week & some positives.csv,"The problem areas in the USA: -------------------------- *- The Schiller PE is at a very high level. Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble. So stocks are highly expensive. *- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022! We are more of a service economy than a goods economy, *- World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle. That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local sales declines are offset. Additionally the trade war hampers both sides. *- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels. *- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers. You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term. People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank. However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials. AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth. AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales. So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia. This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW. I don't own any MKSI. This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording. So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN. Good areas: -------------------------------------- *- Labor productivity is up consistently since Q3 2022. one can see tradingeconomics dot com USA productivity *- Gasoline is lower than last year *- Retail sales are going fine, [ per a recent NPR radio article ] Nuetral ---------------------------------------- *- Labor force participation is not higher than Sept 2023. No more sales growth from people returning to work. Participation is up recently. tradingeconomics has this info. *- Consumer confidence is still down since January 2020.

Liz Ann Sonders, Chief Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab, pointed out that beneath the surface, the average stock in the Nasdaq has experienced a 37% drawdown, compared to the 7% maximum drawdown of the index from its year-to-date high.

"Impacting NVDA is underlying logic,what does OpenAI is change in strategy mean.csv","Big model pre-training bottleneck: Silicon Valley AI labs are generally struggling with new model training, with OpenAI's Orion and Google's Gemini 2.0 failing to significantly outperform their predecessors, defying the “law of scaling”. This law used to mean that model performance would continue to increase with data and computation, but the scaling effect has now plateaued. Computing in the reasoning phase: To overcome pre-training bottlenecks, OpenAI and other labs are exploring “compute on test” techniques that enable human-like multi-step reasoning by allowing models to generate and evaluate multiple possibilities in real-time during the reasoning phase. This approach can be used more effectively for complex tasks such as mathematics and coding to optimize reasoning performance. Hardware Demand Shift: Market demand is likely to shift from large-scale pre-training clusters to inference clouds as new technologies reduce parameter requirements. This will weaken NVIDIA's monopoly in the training chip market, and the inference chip market may see more competition, especially as companies such as Groq may fill the new demand. Capital Trends: Venture capital organizations are highly concerned about this change, and are gradually investing more resources in distributed inference clouds to cater to the distributed server needs of inference computing.",0.5346,POSITIVE,0.6048

The high cost of chip manufacturing and R&D, coupled with the uncertain global economic landscape, poses significant challenges. The company’s ability to execute its ambitious plans while maintaining financial stability is a key factor to watch in the coming years. Recent Financials: Intel Corporation’s recent financial performance reflects the challenges and resilience of a tech giant in a volatile market. In Q3 2023, the company reported a total revenue of $14.2 billion, a decrease of 8% from the same quarter in the previous year. This decline was primarily due to decreases in revenue across its major segments: the Client Computing Group (CCG) revenue decreased by 3%, the Data Center and AI Group (DCAI) by 10%, and the Network and Edge Group (NEX) by a significant 32%. The company’s financial strategy also reflects a commitment to operational efficiency and cost management. By streamlining processes and optimizing resources, Intel aims to improve its profitability and shareholder value in the long term. This approach is crucial as the company faces intense competition from other tech giants and emerging players in the semiconductor industry. In conclusion, Intel’s recent financial performance, though marked by challenges, showcases the company’s strategic efforts to remain a dominant player in the tech industry. The company’s focus on innovation, operational efficiency, and market adaptability will be key to its future success and financial stability. Financial Bullet Points: Revenue (Q3 2023): $14.2 billion, down 8% YoY. Client Computing Group Revenue: Decreased by 3%. Data Center and AI Group Revenue: Decreased by 10%. Network and Edge Group Revenue: Decreased by 32%. Gross Margin (Q3 2023): 42.5%, slightly down from 42.6% YoY. Net Income (Q3 2023): $297 million, a substantial decline from $1.019 billion YoY. Earnings Per Share (Q3 2023): $0.07, with non-GAAP EPS at $0.41. Business Model & Competitors Analysis: Intel’s business model revolves around its dominance in CPUs, with expansion into data center solutions, IoT, and AI.

Intel potential comeback.csv,"Hey! Intel seems like a company that's really struggling right now. Their stock just dropped to around $20.16, and it’s not just the GPU market giving them trouble. They’re battling issues on multiple fronts. First off, their foundry business (where they manufacture chips) is bleeding money – about $7 billion in annual losses! They’re not expected to break even there until at least 2027. On top of that, they’re losing market share to AMD and Nvidia, both in CPUs and GPUs. Nvidia is dominating with AI, and AMD is taking more and more of the gaming market. It also feels like they completely missed the whole AI boom. Nvidia is raking in insane profits, while Intel seems to be… just watching? And to make things worse, their CEO recently stepped down, which makes their future even more uncertain. That said, they’ve just launched their new Arc B580 and B570 budget GPUs. Nvidia and AMD seem more focused on AI and data centers right now, so maybe Intel has a shot at carving out a space in gaming? But is that really enough to turn things around? What do you guys think?

Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings.csv,"This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights. The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected. The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market. Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies. The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion. Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%. However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time. Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price. At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down. Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven. Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk? Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations. According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report. The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability. Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June. However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025. Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence? The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time. Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications. JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable. Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed. LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",0.5811,NEGATIVE,0.9443

Hi! I’m Dan Howley, the tech editor at Yahoo Finance, and Nvidia has seemingly been at the forefront of virtually everything I’ve covered since ChatGPT hit the scene in 2022. I’ve been covering the tech space for 13 years and tracking Nvidia for even longer. I built my first desktop PC with an Nvidia graphics card in high school and have continued using its products ever since. Now I, like everyone else, am focused on Nvidia’s AI efforts, from reporting on how they’re dealing with the threat of increased competition to attending the company’s GTC conference to chatting with CEO Jensen Huang alongside my colleague Julie Hyman. With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia’s chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like AMD are gaining steam, and Nvidia’s own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant. How that plays out over the next few years is anyone’s guess. In today’s fiscal 2025 third quarter earnings report, Nvidia beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines on the strength of sales of its high-powered AI chips. 💵 Revenue: $35.08B vs $33.2B expected 💲 Adjusted EPS: $0.81 vs $0.74 expected 💾 Data center revenue: $30.8B vs $29B expected Nvidia also said it anticipates revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, for the fiscal fourth quarter.

Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&P 500 gains.csv,"= just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing = The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023 https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9 The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions. It’s an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve’s inflation battle, noted FactSet’s Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post. The 10 top performing days for the S&P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%. The S&P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday’s close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%. Through Dec. 22, the S&P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%. Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said. That didn’t mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote. Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found. Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July. The strategy “indicates the Fed’s measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,” Jakobsen said. The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks’ bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group’s announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering. SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a “mini” banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown. Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks — Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78% , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, 0.16%, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%, Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%, Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%, and Meta Platforms Inc. META, 0.56%. See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024? Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind. The S&P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted. In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high: The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&P 500’s weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted. Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&P 500’s overall return, he wrote, with the company’s success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.",0.5482,NEGATIVE,0.9995
Mega-caps vs small caps.csv,"The current state of the stock market exhibits a stark contrast between the performance of mega-cap and small-cap stocks, as investors grapple with mixed signals from major corporations and broader market indices.  Recent developments have highlighted this divide, with Microsoft's upcoming earnings report set to further shape the narrative. Mega-Cap Weakness and Market Impact Microsoft, a key player in the technology sector, is set to report its earnings after the market close, and its performance could significantly influence investor sentiment.  The recent underperformance of large-cap stocks like Merck and Procter & Gamble, both of which have disappointed with earnings guidance, has contributed to the Nasdaq Composite's (-0.9%) and S&P 500's (-0.4%) downward pressure.  This weakness is reflected in the Vanguard Mega-Cap Growth ETF (MGK), which is down 1.1%. Small-Cap Resilience In contrast, small-cap stocks have shown relative strength, with the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 Value Index posting gains.  The equal-weighted S&P 500 is also holding its own, indicating that smaller companies are providing a stabilizing force in the market.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, buoyed by the financials and energy sectors, adds to this resilience. Sectors in Focus The IT sector, weighed down by NVIDIA's (-5.0%) decline ahead of AMD's earnings release, is leading the pack of losers.  Consumer staples, also negatively impacted, are lagging behind. On the other hand, financials, and energy sectors are posting gains, offering a glimmer of hope for investors seeking opportunities. Treasuries and Market Sentiment The Treasury market remains relatively calm, with the 2-yr note yield down to 4.38% and the 10-yr note yield at 4.17%.  Economic indicators, such as the better-than-expected consumer confidence index and the Bank of Japan's policy decision, have not sparked significant market movements, suggesting that investors are cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's FOMC decision on Wednesday. As we await Microsoft's earnings report, the stock market's divide between mega-cap and small-cap stocks is a cause for concern, especially for those relying on large-cap performance.  However, the resilience of small-cap companies and select sectors is providing a silver lining. Investors should stay vigilant, monitor market reactions to key earnings releases, and consider a diversified portfolio that takes into account the current market dynamics.  The Federal Reserve's decision will likely play a crucial role in determining the market's next course of action.",0.5419,NEGATIVE,0.9136

MSFT faces long-term potential disadvantages.csv,"I think one of the main reasons Microsoft is a great long-term investment is its long history of generating a lot of free cash flow. At the time of writing, the company's free cash flow margin is over 30%, with free cash flow rising from $15.9 billion in 2009 to $74.1 billion in the last 12 months. This financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments. While Microsoft may not seem like a value investment, in my opinion, its pricing is reasonable given its continued revenue and earnings growth, and it's likely to continue for the foreseeable future. I estimate EPS growth of 13% on a regular basis over the next 12 months. Based on this projection, I have a price target of $482.40 and estimate that the stock will trade at a non-GAAP P/E ratio of around 36. Looking ahead, I expect Microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15% over the next 5 to 10 years. While this prospect necessitates buying the stock at a fair valuation, I believe the current price provides an opportunity. The company's forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is only 6.5% above its five-year average, while its forward diluted earnings per share growth rate is nearly the same at 5.8%. MSFT faces long-term potential headwinds One potential challenge to Microsoft's long-term growth in AI is that its adoption can be cyclical. Currently, the demand for AI systems is high, which has prompted Microsoft and other big tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion. However, when the current trend peaks (likely due to macroeconomic constraints), growth may slow. According to the TipRanks risk analysis tool, Microsoft is exposed to 32% risk from legal and regulatory factors, which is higher than the industry average and could impact its AI operations due to increased scrutiny of data privacy and AI governance. Given this outlook, I expect some volatility in Microsoft's long-term growth trajectory, although it may not be as good as NVIDIA NVDA -0.06% ▼ and so on semiconductor companies so obvious. As market sentiment fluctuates, cyclical price and valuation declines coincide with temporarily lower growth rates and may provide more attractive buying opportunities. There is also a risk that Microsoft and other Big Tech players could over-invest in AI infrastructure. With 21% of its risk related to Tech & Innovation, Microsoft’s heavy investment in AI-driven initiatives, including data center infrastructure, could result in lower-than-expected returns if industry growth does not meet expectations. This may impact free cash flow margins in the medium term, contributing to further volatility.",0.5607,NEGATIVE,0.8794

The demand for its AI GPUs remains high, the company has been receiving upward revisions recently, and its stock is trading around its all-time high levels with a potential to appreciate even further in the upcoming months.

Nvidia announces 50 billion stock buyback.csv,"Nvidia said Wednesday that its board of directors has approved a $50 billion stock buyback. The computer chip giant announced the share repurchase as part of its fiscal second-quarter earnings, in which it reported earnings and guidance that surpassed Wall Street expectations. Nvidia returned $15.4 billion to shareholders in share repurposes and cash dividends as part of the company’s first half of its fiscal 2025. The company said it had $7.5 billion remaining under its share repurchase plan, as of the end of its fiscal second quarter. Last year, Nvidia announced a $25 billion share buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results. Companies often experience a boom to their stock price after revealing stock buyback plans. In May, for instance, Apple announced a $110 billion stock buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results that showed overall sales fell 4% year over year and iPhone sales dropped 10% year over year. However, the iPhone maker’s shares rose 7% in after-hours trading, likely because Apple’s share buyback was the biggest in corporate history. With Nvidia’s shares dropping 4% in extended trading despite reporting solid financial results and announcing a stock buyback, some experts believe the company has been doing so well that it is getting harder to impress investors.

Nvidia More Room to Run Just Getting Started.csv,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they’ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don’t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical. Yes, Nvidia’s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn’t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now. Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn’t possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia’s place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn’t happened and Nvidia’s only gotten stronger. That’s not to say over time Nvidia won’t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it’s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution. Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations. I don’t think AI is a bubble but I do think that Nvidia and the market as a whole can get ahead of themselves.

"Nvidia reports earnings, Fed gathers in Jackson Hole What about this week.csv","In the final week of August, investors will be focused on two major events: Nvidia's earnings and the Federal Reserve's annual meeting in Jackson Hole. The Jackson Hole Economic Symposium will kick off on Thursday, with Fed Chair Jay Powell's address serving as the major event. Powell's comments on interest rates, the economy, and any indication that inflationary pressures are driving a reassessment of the Fed's present aims will be scrutinized. On the corporate front, Nvidia headlines the earnings story this week, with the chipmaker scheduled to publish data from a quarter that caused the chipmaker to increase its revenue forecast by 50%. Lowe's, BJ's Wholesale Club, and Peloton are also set to announce earnings this week. August is shaping up to be the worst month for stocks this year, with all three main averages closing last week lower after a hawkish read of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting sent equities lower and Treasury rates higher in the second half of the week. Economic data continues to come in stronger than expected, with the July retail sales report indicating a 0.7% increase in sales for the month, about double what economists forecast. The AtlantaFed's GDPNow projection now predicts third-quarter GDP growth of 5.8%, the strongest rate since the fourth quarter of 2021. Inflation has declined dramatically since Powell's Jackson Hole speech last year, when he predicted rates will climb until the ""job is done,"" lowering inflation. Powell has stated as recently as July that inflation is ""well above"" the Fed's long-run objective of 2%. On the corporate front, all eyes will be on Nvidia, which predicted that artificial intelligence demand will increase its current quarter sales projection from $7 billion to $11 billion. Nvidia stock is up about 200% year to date, but its gains have slowed along with the market since mid-July.

Qualcomm Approached Intel About a Takeover in Recent Days.csv,"Qualcomm recently approached Intel with a takeover proposal, marking what could be one of the largest tech deals in recent memory, according to sources. Intel, once valued at over $290 billion, has seen its market cap fall to around $90 billion after a challenging year in which its shares dropped 60%. While a deal is far from guaranteed, Qualcomm’s interest comes as Intel struggles to recover under CEO Pat Gelsinger’s turnaround plan, which has yet to deliver significant results. Should Intel be receptive, the deal could face heavy antitrust scrutiny, though some argue it might bolster U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor industry. Qualcomm may consider offloading parts of Intel to complete the acquisition. Both companies have sought to capitalize on the AI boom, though they’ve lagged behind Nvidia. Intel, grappling with factory delays and cost-cutting measures, is receiving government subsidies as part of its efforts to build chip factories. A Qualcomm takeover could enhance its portfolio by adding Intel’s dominance in PCs and servers to its smartphone chip business. Despite this potential merger, Intel continues to face major hurdles, including the possible need to split its design and manufacturing operations amid growing calls for the company to separate its business divisions.

S&P 20 years ago versus today Via @alerts on IG.csv,2004: Walmart ExxonMobil Chevron Citi IBM General Electric GM Ford 2024: Microsoft (7.84%) Apple (6.83%) Nvidia (3.8%) Alphabet (3.72%) Amazon (3.5%) Meta (2.1%) Berkshire Hathaway (1.71%) Broadcom (1.28%) Interesting to see the discrepancies and differences in the top eight from 2004 compared to the top eight from 2024. Not exactly surprising to see these giants at the top of the list. The year is 2044... does the top eight look relatively similar to what it looks like now? Feels hard to argue otherwise. Then again they probably said similar things in 2004. It just seems like GAFAM will continue to purchase any successful companies of smaller size. Rarely do we see standalone companies anymore (at least big ones).,0.5401,NEGATIVE,0.9989
Serious question from someone who took a four-year trading break.csv,Hey everyone After a long long hiatus and licking my wounds I decided to try trading once again. Recently I've been changing up my approach and doing 5-7 DTE spy options. And it's been going pretty decent however recently I got a couple of August 30th calls for Nvidia I managed to get in at a good position for 133 calls. My thesis is that it's going to keep pumping up to the day of earnings. I don't have any intention of holding the position up until expiration. My question is regarding theta decay and volatility. I know that the closer I got to the expiration the less profit I'll see as a percentage of my position. And I also understand that during high levels of volatility it can go both ways. And I'm not really asking for specific advice just kind of guidance or knowledge as to how that may affect my position. I'm holding them over the weekend and I'm expecting Monday to start off a little red but to finish off green and so I'm not quite sure if I want to sell half my positions and wait till earnings or if I should wait to earnings in general. I strongly believe that Nvidia is going to beat their earnings I just don't know how drastically that's going to affect the price action. Any and all input is definitely appreciated Thanks in advance,0.5421,NEGATIVE,0.9936

Super Micro Falls as Hindenburg Takes Aim With Short Report.csv,"Super Micro Computer Inc.'s shares took a hit on Tuesday following a short report from Hindenburg Research that questioned the company's financial practices and transparency. Hindenburg's report alleged significant accounting red flags, undisclosed related-party transactions, and potential violations of sanctions and export controls. Initially, the report caused Super Micro's stock to plummet by as much as 8.7%, but it later rebounded to close down 2.6%. The server manufacturer has been a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, with its high-performance servers in high demand for data centers. This surge in AI-related demand has driven significant growth for the company, doubling its revenue to $14.9 billion in the most recent fiscal year. Despite a steep decline from its March peak, Super Micro's stock remains up over 90% for the year, reflecting continued investor interest in the burgeoning AI sector. However, the Hindenburg report could intensify scrutiny on Super Micro's accounting practices and client relationships, particularly as the company has faced regulatory challenges in the past. In 2020, Super Micro resolved a U.S. SEC investigation by correcting its financial statements and paying a penalty for accounting issues from 2014 to 2017. As the AI market continues to expand, maintaining investor confidence will be crucial for Super Micro, especially amid concerns about the profitability of AI-optimized servers and the potential for increased regulatory oversight.

Technical Analysis Lesson - Reversal Day in Nvidia (NVDA).csv,"Every trader wants to know when the trend is changing from up to down or down to up. This happens when the leadership in the market changes from bulls to bears or bears to bulls. These trend changes are what every trader looks for. If they can accurately predict market turns, they can profit. That’s why they do what they do. Sometimes this change of leadership is slow and takes a long period of time to happen. These changes have price action that tends to show up on a chart as a ‘Rounded Top’ or ‘Rounded Bottom’ pattern. Sometimes the reversal is abrupt and takes place over a few time periods. This action tends to show up on a chart as a ‘V’ or ‘Inverted V’ reversal. But sometimes the trend changes just in one day... These dynamics can show up on a chart as a ‘Reversal Day’ pattern. One may have just happened in the stock of Nivida (NVDA). The Western world would call it an ‘Outside Reversal Day’. In candlestick terminology, it is called a ‘Bearish Engulfing Pattern’. It’s important to note that these candlestick patterns are at least 700 years old. They were developed by Japanese rice traders. It shows that the human nature which is illustrated in charts hasn’t changed. The name doesn’t matter. The action that it illustrates does. On Friday morning, it looked as though the uptrend in NVDA was going to continue for yet another day. It opened at a higher price than Thursday’s close. But then the tide turned… Over the day, the sellers came out of the woodwork. And not only did they hold off the assault. They overpowered the buyers and eventually pushed the price much lower. Importantly, Friday’s closing price was lower than Thursday’s opening price. This is frequently a characteristic of a trend that is reversing. Sometimes the change of leadership from bulls to bears happens over an extended time-period. But sometimes it occurs in just one day. That could be the case here.",0.5201,NEGATIVE,0.9938

News: Nvidia Tumbles After Disappointing Forecast, Blackwell Chip Snags Mostly earnings aftermaths today. NVDA - Earnings yesterday, beat expectations but weren’t the blowout everyone expected. Executives said on the earnings call that NVDA still expects to begin earning revenue from Blackwell in this fiscal year. EPS of 0.68 vs 0.64 exp. $50B share buyback. Revenue grew close to 122% YoY. Overall, I don’t really see a reason to change one’s position if long/short. (I’m not changing mine, which is currently long.) AFRM - Reported a massive beat on earnings, following a beat on the top/bottom lines. EPS of -0.14 cents vs -0.51 cents expected, revenue of $659M vs $604M expected. Also cited a new goal of hitting operating profitability on a GAAP basis by 4th quarter of 2025. Analyst stated rate cuts would be beneficial for the company and allowed for greater loan sales. DG - Cuts outlook, blaming “financially constrained” customers. Forecast changed from $5.50-$6.20, from $6.80-$7.55. DLTR also down off this news because they trade similarly with each other. CRWD - Spiked initially due to beating quarterly estimates, but lowered FY guidance mainly due to incentives for a customer commitment package after a July 19th outage. $1.04 vs 97 cents expected. Revenue of $963.9M vs $959M expected. SMCI - Still watching after the Hindenburg Research report 2 days ago, they reported they were delaying postponing filing of their 10K. Keep in mind they could be delisted (again) because of these delays, will likely post a writeup about it this weekend. Earnings: DELL, LULU, ULTA, ADSK, MDB",0.5413,NEGATIVE,1.0

TSM investment.csv,"Does anyone have any opinions on if this is a good investment? Given the recent AI boom everyone is focused on big players such as NVIDIA and AMD, but they are both supplied heavily by TSM for their chips. I don’t see much competition for TSM given they are so far advanced ahead of any American or Chinese competitor, and given the only increase in demand for AI technology, I don’t see how they wouldn’t grow. Yes the stock is expensive right now, but given the growth opportunity I would argue there is still plenty of room for expansion. Yes, China is a threat, but something tells me that China would not dare suffer the economic sanctions western nations would impose if they made a move in Taiwan. Trump has said he would likely put tariffs on the Taiwan semiconductor industry in order to grow domestic production, but still with tariffs, I don’t see big players switching to alternatives, as the gap between TSM and alternatives is very large.

TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand.csv,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp. July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations. As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range. TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97. TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half. However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies. TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance. Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

They are also mass producing 3nm chips which is starting to make up a nice chunk of their revenue. My main concern is obviously china but also that they are too tied to nvidia. Whenever i see them in the market, if NVIDIA is up 3%, they are up 6%, but if NVIDIA is down 3%, they are down 6-7%. Is it still a buy even though it has risen almost 50% this year?

Understand this about INTC.csv,"INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is. What do I mean by this? Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing. Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet. This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert. What exactly is Intel's bet? The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both. Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets. With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one. What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets? Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years. Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler. TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies. Should I become a bagholder? Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it. Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.",0.5533,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Which Quantum Stock to invest in Avoid QUBT.csv,"Following on from my recent DD on Quantum Computing Inc (QUBT), a lot of messages and a 70% rise in share price that has cooked my puts, I decided I'd dive a bit deeper QUBT does not have leading quantum physicists or innovation. Monroe has more talent in his pinky Similar to when evaluating biotechs, in the quantum computing industry you need to consider the academic and publishing background of employees. Quantum Computing is a pioneering area of science, innovations are typically borne out of research conducted by universities and research centres that are published and reviewed. As I explained in my past post, QUBT's staff did not attain their Phds at leading universities (something which is very important given the quantum computing academic field is relatively small and nascent). Furthermore, even if you thought they might be diamonds in the rough - their publication records indicate that they are abysmal researchers (see above). The citation count of QUBT's entire (quantum) employee count is unable to match the citation count of individual founders from competing firms. This is a clear indication that their 'innovations' and patents are likely to fail commercially. For every technical staff member at QUBT, there is $42million in market capitalisation. Bearish signal: Big capital raises and no hiring Furthermore, even if I was agnostic on education and publishing background, just from a headcount perspective, they do not have the people. They are the smallest of the four leading small cap quantum firms. And despite capital raises, including a recent $50 million capital raise and booming stock price, they have not shown signs of new hiring. The current market cap of $1.33 billion appears unsustainable, and works out to $42 million per technical staff member - that's more than my dad made in his entire life. Where has the money gone? If you believe what the company is saying, the money from their recent capital raises are going into a foundry dedicated to processing thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) chips for use in quantum computing. There are a number of commercial lithium niobate suppliers, and unlike what they claim on their website, suppliers do exist in countries other than China - see Switzerland, USA, UK. Given the relative obscurity of QUBT's employees, it is unlikely that they'll manage to either make functioning chips (which they are already falling behind on) or beat out their competitors who possess significantly more valuable patents, better manufacturing capability and greater commercial links (i.e. with Amazon, Nvidia, Google). Also here is what Quantum Computing Inc’s foundry looks like, which notably Iceberg Research exposed them for lying about its size. But would QUBT really mislead investors? QUBT has pivoted many times during its history: from beverage company, to quantum software, artificial intelligence, and now quantum chips. It naturally begs the question, should potential investors believe QUBT's claims?

Why am I bullish on SFY instead of SPY.csv,"A comparison analysis between the holdings of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY), I have compiled information from the most recent available data. Below is a table showing the top 10 holdings for each ETF along with their percentage weight in the respective ETFs. This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings: Data Sources: SPY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Schwab, Yahoo Finance. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST) SFY Holdings: Stock Analysis, Zacks.com, Yahoo Finance. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST) Key Observations: Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting. It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation. I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors: Expense Ratio: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. Stock Selection Methodology: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. Performance Trends: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. Portfolio Diversification: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. Market Positioning: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. Innovative Approach of SoFi: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy. It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.

"Why Are Analysts Increasing NVIDIA’s Price Target Is It Out of Fear That Something Bad Will Happen, .csv","NVIDIA, often considered the heart of AI stocks, has recently been in the spotlight as analysts uniformly raise their stock targets. To me, this trend seems somewhat peculiar, even considering the current earnings season. The buoyant optimism surrounding the stock’s potential rise is sparking doubt in my mind.

A stumble in NVIDIA’s stock could trigger a broader tech market downfall, while success could reignite a bullish trend for tech stocks.

NVIDIA has a few major phases in its history: Dot-com boom: In the early 2000s, all you needed was a website with a .com domain ending. Gaming boom: Starting in the 2000s, technology entered the mass market, and the gaming industry began growing. It continues to grow today, and to play a high-quality video game, you would need an NVIDIA video card. Cryp* boom: This started in the early 2010s and continues to this day. To mine cryp*, you need an NVIDIA video card. AI boom: This is happening now. Can you imagine AI model training or running without an NVIDIA video card? What’s next? I think the next big wave is biotechnology. What do you think, what is the next step?",0.5482,POSITIVE,0.966
Worse case scenario the perfect Bear cocktail.csv,"After reading all the comments from my last post and doing some more thinking. I decided to entertain the idea of what would be the perfect Bear cocktail that could trigger a Stock Market destabilization. I'm not taking into account any type of positive news. I'm simply going the negative route, in a slow and systematic manner, without any huge trigger events. What am I missing and at what dates that's important and could also add to this? If you notice in the prior post list, three out of six times... rising interest rates were part of the cause that brought the market down at least 20%. Oil price shocks two out of 6. Then there´s speculative investments at the dotcom bubble. Covid, overvaluation, trade tensions... Stagflation. So these have to be in the mix one way or another: Cocktail Potential Ingredients: Rising interest rates. Oil price shocks. Speculative tech investments. Overvaluation. Trade tensions. Stagflation. New round of Covid-19. Housing or Commercial Real Estate Bubble. So this is the speculative worse case scenario we could have without going as far as having a WWIII: February 13, 2024: CPI report comes in hot. S&P500 comes down 1.5%, some buy the tiny dip. February 15, 2024: Jobless claims rise. Doesn't alter the market but adds to the cocktail mix. February 16, 2024: A higher-than-expected PPI indicates increasing costs at the producer level, which can signal rising inflationary pressures. Producers might pass these higher costs onto consumers, leading to an increase in consumer prices and overall inflation. The Fed to consider tightening monetary policy more aggressively than previously anticipated to combat inflation. This could include raising interest rates or adjusting the pace of tapering asset purchases. Financial markets don't react negatively to a higher-than-expected PPI, as it they priced it in from the CPI report. February 21, 2024: Nvidia posts earnings, they actually do fine but investors realize that´s gonna be the ceiling for now so the stock falls 15%. Other tech stocks get stained by the fear, bringing the S&P500 2.5% lower. AI investment sentiments leans towards potentially speculative for now. March 12, 2024: February´s CPI report comes in hot again, causing Algorithmic trades to sell and bring down the S&P500 another 2%. March 19-20, 2024: FOMC Meeting gives subtext of potentially not bringing interest rates down yet. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterates emphasis on the central bank's commitment to combating inflation, even if it requires keeping interest rates high for an extended period. This brings down the market sentiment down and numbers another 1%. April 5, 2024: In a CNBC YouTube video report, experts delve into the complexities of the current commercial real estate (CRE) market. The rise of remote work led to a decreased demand for office spaces, the pandemic trained people to make purchases online, commercial real estate bubble starts to show symptoms of cracking up. April 10, 2024: CPI report is on ambiguous. Not up, not down. Anything could happen at this point. Aprils report will define what the FED will do and the next 6 months of stock market activity. Market loses .5% April 17, 2024: Tom Lee's bullish perspective has been challenged by the prior events and during an interview he mentions that this was the turmoil he had been expecting but sees the S&P500 going back to 5,200 points by the end of the year. Currently at 4,600... 7.5% below all time highs. May 1, 2024: FOMC Meeting leaves a bad taste in mouth. Jerome shifts narrative towards not lowering interests rates yet. Market falls another 2.5% on the bad sentiment. May 15, 2024: Situations in the Middle East, such as tensions in Gaza or Iran, could impact global oil supplies by affecting regional stability and energy infrastructure. Saudi Arabia, a key OPEC member, might alter its oil production strategy in response to shifts in global politics, economic pressures, or changes in energy demand. Actions perceived as irrational could stem from strategic decisions to protect national interests, influence oil prices, or respond to international events. S&P500 falls 0.5%. July 8, 2024: A new wave of Covid-19 actually breaks through the collective deceit of it being over because death rates rise significantly and word spreads out again from hospital staff that's it's getting real bad. Stock market reacts in a mixed manner. Amazon and tech companies go up a little, small caps enter another bad rout. S&P500 falls 1%. July 20, 2024: Numbers start to confirm a Stagflation situation actually taking place. A significant slowdown in economic growth, rising unemployment rates, declining consumer spending, and a contraction in manufacturing. Inflation pressures, coupled with tightening monetary policies aimed at controlling price levels, contribute to decreased economic activity.

August 14, 2024: After all the earnings reports it becomes increasingly clear: the FED won't lower rates and will keep them there for longer than expected; consumer spending is declining, companies keep firing people, the Bear narrative takes over. The S&P500 falls to 4,010 points. 23.5% below all time highs. It stays around here for the next 6 months, falls further and gets better by the end of 2025.",0.5298,NEGATIVE,1.0

[NVDA] Today’s strong buying activity is driven by two main factors.csv,"1. Microsoft’s AI Developments and Capital Expenditure Projections: Unlike Google, Microsoft has already developed significant revenue-generating AI applications, such as CoPilot. Additionally, Microsoft has a unique advantage with its insights into OpenAI, the leading AI company globally, which remains privately held. No other public company has such a perspective. Microsoft is privy to specific data regarding demand and metrics for OpenAI’s consumer and enterprise solutions, which serves as a crucial indicator of AI sentiment, second only to Nvidia. Remember the partnership with Apple? 2. AMD’s Earnings Report: AMD has projected significant demand and growth, suggesting a positive trend. If AMD is experiencing this level of demand, it’s worth considering what Nvidia might be experiencing. AMD indicated no signs of slowing down in AI product demand through 2025 and beyond. This situation resembles a gap and go reversal driven by positive news and sentiment, which often signifies a market bottom. I’ve been suggesting that we are nearing this point, and I believe today has confirmed it.",0.5727,POSITIVE,0.9972
