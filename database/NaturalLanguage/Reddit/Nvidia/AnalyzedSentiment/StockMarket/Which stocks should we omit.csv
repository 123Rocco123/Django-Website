Gamble with 50k. That way you can guarantee 5/6 of your portfolio will be normalized equity returns and will be at least average over the long term. The difference between starting with 200k and 250k. Could be 2-3 years of compounding and at the tail end of your investment horizon, this could mean hundreds of thousands of dollars per year that you will miss out on.",0,0.535,0.999,NEGATIVE

I’m not saying they will go bankrupt. The gambling comes from the opportunity cost of selecting specific companies when you have no idea if their valuation or long term returns will be better than any index or any other investment vehicle.I’m totally fine if they want to do that with their money. It’s theirs to choose where and how they allocate those funds. I’m simply saying from a portfolio management and risk standpoint, it would be a more responsible decision to select individual stocks with less than 100k. Especially since that’s 33% of their entire portfolio",2,0.524,0.994,NEGATIVE

Apple Amazon Tesla Rocket lab USA C3.ai Salesforce Occidental petroleum Berkshire Hathaway McDonald’s Microsoft Google Nasdaq- Nvidia Soligenix","I think we’re agreeing and disagreeing at the same time here. You’re absolutely right about ETFs potentially not performing either. That’s the risk that the opportunity cost presents.However, the big ETFs have been reliably printing 8-10% average over LONG periods of time. Because of the nature of ETFs specifically like SPY or VOO, they are designed to capture the winners over time and discard the losers. You take the good with the bad, but it has historically proven to yield reliable returns.Individual stocks do not carry those attributes. Even the greatest stocks today, didn’t exist 50 years ago. Nor did the greatest 50 years ago exist 50 or so before that. I’m generalizing here but I think you see my point. Survivorship over long periods of time has never been in favor of the individual selector and a million other factors go into what drives returns in short, medium and long term for these stocks.Price returns generally follow a normal distribution and if you know a bit about statistics, it just means that your returns are generally destined to be zero or below zero given enough observations and including transaction costs. You generally need around 30 observations to make this principle bullet proof.Here there are 10 observations. These could go really well, these could go really bad. The point is that you don’t know and 2/3 of the time you’re going to do close to zero or below that significantly.I’m just ranting at this point so sorry.",4,0.524,1.0,NEGATIVE
