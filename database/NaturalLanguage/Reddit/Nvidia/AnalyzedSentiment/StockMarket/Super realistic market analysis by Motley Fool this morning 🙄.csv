,,"Years ago, Motley Fool provided worthwhile analysis and an alternative to all the hype that pervades some corners of the media. They had something called ‚ÄúThe Rulemaker Portfolio.‚Äù This was a collection of stocks that were so dominant in their respective industries that they set the trends their competitors copied.The ‚Äúrulemaker‚Äù representing retail was Gap. (That shows how long ago it was). They were mulling over whether to sell GPS. They actually convened a committee that agonized for hours over what to do. Eventually, they decided to sell. One of the committee members posted an article about the decision and how they wouldn‚Äôt know for years if they‚Äôd done the right thing. (Spoiler alert: they did).Contrast that with the worthless garbage they put out today. They spew a few paragraphs about why some stock went up/down a bunch (that anyone could figure out by reading the news). Then there‚Äôs a link to a stock ‚ÄúMotley Fool likes better.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs the ultimate hype site.",0,0.526,NEGATIVE,0.988
