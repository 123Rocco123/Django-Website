Never look at yourself as having an edge of advantage because, more often than not, someone better already has that edge. Ride the trend and follow successful strategies within your own risk.

A lot of people believe in an imminent squeeze since the case for good fundamentals has merit to it and dream of re-living the 2007 uranium bubble.Therefore and since it's a very volatile sector, every time there's a huge upside swing, a lot of people FOMO in, thinking ""this is it"". But it's never ""it"", it always goes up to go back down.What you do is buy on down periods and sell as fast as possible to secure your gains. Don't buy in the ""story buying"" of such companies. Don't be a sucker among hundreds.However, when doing so, avoid nano/micro-caps with high dilution potential. Especially junior mining stocks, which are lottery tickets. A lot of them are scams to milk investors, too, as you probably know.What I then usually do is reinvest the profits in more secure / less volatile assets (ex.: VOO, XEQT).Finally, you could always launch a junior mining company, build a credible board of directors, pump your stock on YouTube and pay yourself a huge salary without ever finding gold, silver, uranium, or whatever you're hypping.",0,0.528,NEGATIVE,0.96
