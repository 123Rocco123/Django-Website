,,"I'll see you below $15 a share, otherwise, hard pass.",0,0.535,0.999,NEGATIVE
,,$15 is a little too low. Softbank purchased it in 2016 for $36B and now offering is ~$54B. He is recouping his money by overpricing it. The big issue for me is 24% of the revenue is from ARM China but the financials are essential a black box. I will sit on the side-line until $20-25 range.,1,0.521,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"They’re in it 40B since they had to buy back the shares they sold through their visionfund for 2x what those investors paid.Overall that’s 3% annualized. Softbank is IPOing it at a loss.It’s priced at 25x earnings revenue, 104x profits with a negative growth trend.The buy zone is definitely $15.",2,0.536,1.0,NEGATIVE

,,What’s the reason for that?,3,0.497,0.994,NEGATIVE
,,"I do not know exactly. Exchanges have some rules, it takes about 6 weeks for companies to be added if they meet criteria. This is what I was able to find, but I don't know if it is accurate:The company must have a mimimum of 7,000,000 publicly held shares outstanding.The stock must be listed on the NYSE, Nasdaq, AMEX or any national stock exchange..For the past 5 trading days, the closing price of the stock must have a minimum per share price for a majority of trading days. This means that IPO issues cannot have options traded on them until 5 days after the initial public offering date.There must be at least 2,000 shareholders in the company.",4,0.567,0.935,NEGATIVE

,,"Right!! I feel the same way, VC bought in early, pushes for IPO to dump on retail. Not the first, won’t be the last",1,0.526,0.999,NEGATIVE
,,SoftBank isn’t a VC in the typical sense. They own 100% of ARM having repurchased the portion they sold to their customers through their visionfund.,2,0.522,0.607,NEGATIVE
,,"Well the run like a VC. And often pressured these companies to IPO so they can exit all or part of their portfolio by dumping on retail. Take “GRAB” for example, a Singapore based company that operates like Uber, it’s a young company, P&L and balance sheet are garbage, those conditions are not prime for IPO, and it was pressured to, the share price a launch was way overvalued and now anyone that bought in at the start it’s all red.Well ARM is a important part of the semi con ind, but they face many issues, even had their china office invaded and take over by a rouge ceo. If they are so profitable, why IPO and share a cut with retail? They could just do another round of funding to jack up the value of the company.Sry I’m just being extra cautious here, so should many, money is hard earn, don’t waste it.",3,0.55,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,ARM itself is a hardware architecture.They are commonly used in micro-computer boards for their low power consumption and low heat generation (important for small devices).So basically anything that isn't a desktop computer is probably using an ARM processor.The apple M1 laptops are using ARM. I wouldn't bet on apple sticking with ARM forever as they seem to be fair-weather-chip-partners.China is basically working on its own version of ARM; so that will come up eventually,0,0.517,0.876,NEGATIVE
,,Apple confirmed they expand their partnership with ARM beyond 2040,1,0.537,0.978,POSITIVE
,,Ya the phones definitely would be ARM. For desktops & laptops though they signaled they want to do their own chips again. I don't know of that was strategic or aspirational.I am also not an Apple fan boy; just a hardware nerd,2,0.526,0.999,NEGATIVE
,,The m1/m2 chips are arm based in architecture,3,0.529,0.868,POSITIVE
,,Well this statement is sort of right. Arm (architecture not the company) is the future.When you say anything that isn't a desktop; is incorrect there are plenty of devices that use the traditional processor such as Intel etc.Arm has been around it was just never powerful enough to compete.But to keep it simple anytnkng that can do computations without a fan is an arm based processor .. phones; auper thin laptops etc. As time goes on these processors are only gunna get better and one day it'll all be arm based instead of what we have now,1,0.539,0.998,NEGATIVE
,,you have no idea what you're talking about... the new apple chips are absolute powerhouses that are incredibly efficient... the future is ARM,1,0.55,0.996,POSITIVE
,,The real risk to ARM is RISC-V which is open source.,1,0.515,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"Naah, the total cost needed to verify a full risc-v build through the stack that is so widely distributed and less controlled is huge, costly affair. Can hardly match the focused 3000+ odd partners that Arm boasts on their site. I wouldn’t worry about RISC-V. And who is to say that Arm won’t open up their architecture as an end-game if it comes to that? The line between open and open-source is very thin and the wide established ecosystem for arm tilts it to their side.",2,0.514,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,Apple designs their own silicon - they only license the bare minimum from ARM. Same goes for Qualcomm.Since all of the major companies doing high powered implementations are using their own IP that’s why ARMs revenues have been on a downward trend.,1,0.519,0.983,NEGATIVE
,,"May I add that Amazon AWS Gravitons are all Arm, Veloce, Ampere based servers powering the data and infrastructure world, 90% of the mobile market is arm powered, From the canon cameras to small microcontrollers in the Philips Hues bulbs are Arm today. IOT on arm for most advanced Nordic semi chipsets to mbed on IOT. A large screen client compute like M1/M2 may be built by Apple using just the architecture and they could be an architecture licensee but there could be tons of other second tier mobile and laptop oems using arm not just their processors, their Mali GPUs or their interconnect or their physical IP which is the standard foundation library for anything chip design ! The future is certainly very very wide considering that they have enabled through their ecosystem partners shipments exceeding 250 Billion chips over the lifetime. The testament to their work as I see it is close to 5000 odd employees worldwide commanding the valuation with future wide open.",2,0.524,1.0,POSITIVE
,,Yes the ARM ISA as an ecosystem is huge. But licensing the ARM ISA doesn’t produce much revenue.Virtually all of the high powered processors being developed aren’t using ARM cores.For example: https://amperecomputing.com/briefs/ampereone-family-product-briefARM has been languishing for the last decade.,3,0.518,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,Raspberry Pi and Qualcomm Snapdragon use ARM architecture. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_SnapdragonThe competitor to ARM which Russia is backing is called RISC-V. I suspect China will use this too going forward. Intel should be dropping on ARM’s release since they’re a competitor to x86_64 architecture.,1,0.531,0.999,NEGATIVE

,,Go see Kevins video about the topic of how softbank possition itself to be able to sell after IPO good find on his part,1,0.523,0.944,NEGATIVE
,,They license out ISA where as AMD/Intel own the ISA (x86) and refuse to let any company use it.So they are making money.The problem is there's a rogue ARM division in China that's licensing out ARM ISA and keeping the money themselves. The China division is effectively another company.IIRC ARM tried to fire the guy who run the Chinese division and he went rogue...So yeeeeeahThere are other ISA license out there like RISC and MIPS but the momentum is on ARM because Android adopted it in masses iirc. And then from there the industry just coalesce around ARM ISA.As for what ISA is:It's chip instruction set. Or a set of commands.It's one level of abstraction above 1's and 0's.There much more to this though but that's the basic gist of it.,0,0.546,0.995,NEGATIVE
