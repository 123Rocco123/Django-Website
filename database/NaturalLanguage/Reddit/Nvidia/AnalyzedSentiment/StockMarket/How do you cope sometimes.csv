I scalped 40 bucks off it was waiting for it to go down just a little more before I jumped back in and I was bout to go all in, it shot up 70% Friday then 60% today. Couple weeks ago had ocea on my radar had order to buy in at 1.50 next thing you know its up 70% and ive learned not to fomo buy so I stayed out, then shot up 300% over the next week 😳.. I was mad yes but I looked at the fact I picked 2 good stocks that would have made me alot more money so I'm on the right track. What helped me get my mind off it was take notes, what day did they spike, what was volume like leading up, what time of the day did it spike, what news possibly came out, who holds that stock ect. Doing this gave me confidence ill do better on the next stock putting my mind at ease. Im in wisa right now and made the mistake of buying rigjt after first bell, I broke a rule and kicked my self in the ass, took down the note of my mistake cause it went down a bunch after I bought but dident ruin my day just relaxed did fat kid stuff lolz.
