,,"INTC has been touted as the ""value"" play out of the semi-conductor industry as companies like NVDA and AMD are trading at insane valuations... but when does ""insane"" become reality? NVDA is growing into it's valuation at an incredible pace.INTC: 10-year revenue growth of 20% (total).NVDA: 10-year revenue growth of 1,900%.Chart from ChartWiz.io",0,0.582,0.999,POSITIVE
,,"Based on this chart, NVDA revenue is about 40% larger than INTC, but based on market cap, it's worth 900% more.This only makes sense if you believe the exponential revenue growth will continue.",1,0.561,0.896,POSITIVE
,,Nvda also has massive profit growth to a point where nvda 2024 pe is still less than 40 and forward pe is closer to 30. Thats better than apple at peak.Intel has no profit growth,2,0.566,0.998,NEGATIVE
,,"Looking at INTC P/E makes no sense because they invest everything into building new fabs. They basically have no profit until the fabs are completed.Meanwhile NVDA has no fabs, they are fully reliant on TSMC and their huge profit is a result of long term production deals made years ago with TSMC. Once those deals run out, TSMC will want a larger cut and their profit margin will drop.",3,0.537,0.878,NEGATIVE
,,"Intel fab is few years behind tsmc. (Some projects up to 7 years)Gpus out runs cpus for ai and right now there is no way intel can catch up to nvda for at least next 3-4 years.If you are investing in intel, I feel like you are betting that intel succeeds on their tech to compete with tsmc and also to have meaningful clients that can compete with nvda (or even nvda changing to intel)",4,0.544,0.842,POSITIVE
,,"Intel fab is few years behind tsmc. (Some projects up to 7 years)This is 100% false. If that number could go higher, it would. Intel just started risk production on 18A WITH backside power delivery and GAAFET. Where is TSMC? On 3nm and on FINFET, and they won't have a comparable node until 2026 when their second 2nm plant comes online with backside power delivery.Gpus out runs cpus for ai and right now there is no way intel can catch up to nvda for at least next 3-4 years.The only truth to the statement here is that GPU's outperform CPU's in AI tasks. But what about a dedicated AI accelerator that's neither a CPU, nor GPU? They're already competitive in the hardware. Gaudi 2 already gives 90% of the performance of the H100 and yields 4x the performance per dollar of an H100. Later this year, Gaudi 3 is expected to be a 4x performance increase. Not to mention AMD's MI300X may or may not already beat the H100. Yes, Nvidia has a good product. But the only reason why Nvidia is dominant right now is because the industry was built with their software stack. The entire industry is shifting to open source, and even Nvidia publicly admits that CUDA won't be a moat for much longer. Plus, Intel is making huge strides in their ecosystem and tools to convert workloads over to Gaudi. This is just one of the dozen companies gunning for Nvidia. Everyone else is also making strides in their own development. As the industry moves to open source and the difference comes down to raw computational power, Nvidia is gonna drop like a rock because they're so incredibly price prohibitive.If you are investing in intel, I feel like you are betting that intel succeeds on their tech to compete with tsmc and also to have meaningful clients that can compete with nvda (or even nvda changing to intel)They already have meaningful clients. Microsoft, a multigenerational deal with ARM that gives them exposure to the vast majority of smart phones in the world, plus 2 or possibly 3 other unnamed players at this point (nobody knows if the ARM deal counts as one of those 4). One of which prepaid. Nvidia is using Intel for advanced packaging at the least, if not being one of the unnamed players that have reserved fab space. Then there's the huge defense contract to build all of the US governments high performance silicon. All of this with the limited capacity that their Oregon fab can put out. For all we know, these 4 deals could have bought up the entire fabs capacity. Nobody in the industry will have a comparable node until late 2025 when Samsung is the next to 2nm with backside power delivery and GAAFET. Clearwater Forest early next year will be the spark that starts the fire.",5,0.542,0.993,NEGATIVE

,,"Only one of those 2 companies designs and also has foundries, and is building much more, on home turf btw. That doesn’t mean Nvidia won’t stay the top dog for at least the next 3 years or so, but intel on a 5-10 year timeline has more upside potential.",0,0.569,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"The danger with NVDA valuation is that their revenues may not be able to keep up after this kind of explosive growth.What happens once the first wave of AI processor buying is done, and companies like MSFT are designing their own chips? You could see a drop in revenue like you can see on that chart for 2022-23, and the stock price will crater.This is a cyclical industry. Make sure you have an exit strategy, or be prepared to ride some epic volatility.",0,0.54,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"I think this is a valid fear and why Nvidia is probably a risky 10 year hold, but the risk on that in the 2y time frame is pretty low. 5y is a bit more of who knows.Also nvidia has gotten insanely lucky the last 10 years with the crypto balloon and just as that was faltering the ai balloon. How often do companies become market leaders three times in a row over the span of 15-20 years?",1,0.56,0.998,NEGATIVE
,,"Well said. Eventually the money train will end. I'm betting that it's sooner than later, so im staying the hell away from Nvidia at its current prices. It cannot possibly keep exponentially growing each quarter in a fab constrained market.",1,0.58,0.757,NEGATIVE

,,Great comparison. Let's show a graph of when Nvidia's tech is fully mature versus Intel in a rebuilding stage. Brilliant!,0,0.532,0.986,POSITIVE
,,"One thing NVDA has been consistent on, not ever fully maturing, but always innovating.",1,0.512,0.998,POSITIVE
,,"Well, their tech IS mature, but you are correct that they are always innovating. Still, it's useless comparing the two at this point. If Intel went fabless, with all the CapEx removed from the financials for the fab buildout, that would make Intel a single digit forward PE. Intel is in a rebuilding stage and making aggressive moves to improve its position in the long term. Gelsinger wasn't kidding when he said he bet the company on 18A. How that looks 3-4 years down the road would be a much better comparison if you're going to compare them at all.",2,0.556,1.0,NEGATIVE
