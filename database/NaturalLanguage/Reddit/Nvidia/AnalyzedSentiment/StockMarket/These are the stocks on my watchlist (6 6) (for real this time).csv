,"  Hi! I am an ex-prop trader that trades equities. This is a daily watchlist for trading. I might trade all of the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that don't appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). If you’re on old reddit, click “show images” at the top to see all the charts quickly. I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell. Many stocks I post are <$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade. If you have questions to ask, PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like “Thoughts on _____? will be ignored unless you add detail to the question. News: U.S. Clears Way for Antitrust Inquiries of Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI NVAX- Company said it would be able to deliver a regulator-recommended vaccine against a strain of COVID-19 by September.     NVDA- Watching the 1250 level. Might move down today on news of antitrust inquires from the Justice Dept. and FTC. LULU- Company raises full-year earnings guidance, $2.54 vs $2.38 EPS. Also authorized a $1B stock buyback.       GME- Interested in the $33 level today. Still short calls, will likely hedge if we get up higher and break that level. Had a super interesting conversation with a trader friend that I’ll write up when I have more time.   FIVE- Discount retailer, cut its sales forecast for the year. $.60 vs $.63 cents expected, net sales missed $812M vs $834.3M.
