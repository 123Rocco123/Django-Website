,Good enough for Nancy - good enough for me?,"Good enough for Nancy, good enough for me. Sold my DIS and NNI and shuffled that in. Fuck those guys. I'll probably buy more over this month.She did me a solid with PANW.",0,0.527,POSITIVE,0.984
,Good enough for Nancy - good enough for me?,"So if I understand this correctly, she's expecting it to reach $800+ per share by June 20th, 2025?Still figuring out options as I don't understand it don't want to touch it without knowing what I'm doing.",0,0.551,NEGATIVE,0.999
,Good enough for Nancy - good enough for me?,she's betting the stock will be higher than $800 + the premium by expiry. It's called a LEAPS option.,1,0.571,NEGATIVE,0.998
,Good enough for Nancy - good enough for me?,Options purchased are pre split options. So her 20 options will become 200 options with an $80 strike. At least that is my understanding. And that‚Äôs how my NVDA options worked.,2,0.513,NEGATIVE,0.983
,Good enough for Nancy - good enough for me?,Ya that's it.,3,0.5,POSITIVE,1.0
,Good enough for Nancy - good enough for me?,Got it. Avgo split next load up.,3,0.526,POSITIVE,0.979
,Good enough for Nancy - good enough for me?,"Value wise, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you buy pre-or post split you‚Äôre gonna end up with the same market value you‚Äôll just have more contracts later on what got me was when I buy and sell contracts I have to pay a $0.52 fee per contract per trade. Well when I had 5 NVDA options I paid it 5x. When that jumped to 50 and I wanted to close out I had to pay it 50x but the fee didn‚Äôt change",4,0.541,NEGATIVE,0.996
,Good enough for Nancy - good enough for me?,Interesting. Would there be anyway for us to find out what the premium would be? Or would this only be clear at the point of purchase?,3,0.523,POSITIVE,0.933
,Good enough for Nancy - good enough for me?,"Premium is simply the price she paid for the options, you can look at the date (it's in the picture) of the purchase and then look up the price range at that day.",4,0.521,POSITIVE,0.865
,Good enough for Nancy - good enough for me?,You buy leaps deep in the money to basically leverage your money. You can only buy 1000 shares or buy 20 calls worth 2000 shares,1,0.561,NEGATIVE,0.995
,Good enough for Nancy - good enough for me?,Avgo is currently trading at 1600 plus. does this mean she is betting on it to go down in half?,1,0.493,NEGATIVE,0.999
,Good enough for Nancy - good enough for me?,"I would also like to know thisSince she is buying 80$ calls post-split, and the price would assumingly be ~170-160$ after the split, is she saying it will go down, or is she saying, regardless of what happens, it will definitely be over 80$?In the second case, does she make any money, since she bought her calls at a higher price?",2,0.531,NEGATIVE,1.0
,Good enough for Nancy - good enough for me?,Damn I was about to dip my toes into AVGO but it‚Äôs so expensive per share‚Ä¶.damn millionaires and their advantages. Schwab won‚Äôt do fractional shares.,0,0.508,NEGATIVE,0.841
,Good enough for Nancy - good enough for me?,If their stock price was 1/10 what it is now then how many would you consider buying? 10 perhaps? You might be in luck,1,0.561,NEGATIVE,0.996
,Good enough for Nancy - good enough for me?,Schwab does do fractional shares of individual stocks like AVGO. Go to ‚ÄúTrade‚Äù on the app and look for ‚ÄúSchwab Stock Slices‚Äù under ‚ÄúExplore more ways to invest.‚Äù,1,0.535,NEGATIVE,0.95

,Good enough for Nancy - good enough for me?,I use robinhood for my fractional shares,1,0.522,POSITIVE,0.995
,Good enough for Nancy - good enough for me?,"I bought it at the top, dropped like 15% and since then it gained back 7.5%. If current momentum stays I could see green before the split, so those of you who hop in now can get some nice gains imo",0,0.513,NEGATIVE,0.964
,Good enough for Nancy - good enough for me?,Wouldnt it be better to hop on after split like nvidia or do you think the peak is still not here.,1,0.531,NEGATIVE,0.98
,Good enough for Nancy - good enough for me?,"Before the market correction I assumed that we could reach slightly below 2000 before the split and then some. I think it‚Äôs better to be there when the split happens, usually after such, prices rise",2,0.532,NEGATIVE,0.854
,Good enough for Nancy - good enough for me?,My predictions it will go up within the next few months.,0,0.551,NEGATIVE,0.972

,Good enough for Nancy - good enough for me?,And none of the chip act money goes to Nvidia since it's fabless,2,0.538,NEGATIVE,1.0
,Good enough for Nancy - good enough for me?,Didn't they also sell their shares at the top (at the start of 2022)? Their timing on NVIDIA seems to be spot on.Edit: it was July 2022 and they sold at a loss and then bought back in when it was even lower.,2,0.529,NEGATIVE,0.996
,Good enough for Nancy - good enough for me?,"saying if he has info, no clue is like saying is pope catholic? no clue or is blue a color? no clue or do we need to breath to stay alive? no clue",1,0.5,NEGATIVE,1.0
