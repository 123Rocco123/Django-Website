,"View my 1D chart analysis for Nvidia below, what do you guys think? With the AI boom showing no signs of slowing down (at least not that I'm aware of), I like the company on a fundamental level and have a few shares at around $300, so I'm just looking to add to my position at this point. The circled levels represent the next entry points I'll be looking to get in at. For reference, my next potential entries will depend on developments in the bigger-picture macro sentiment toward artificial intelligence & microchip industries, but for now, are as follows: entry #1 is around $445, entry #2 is around $410, and entry #3 around $375. Was thinking I would add 1 or 2 shares at entry 1, and then larger numbers of shares if price action takes us down to the other 2 circled areas. Wondering whether any of you guys think the price will reach as low as $370 in the coming months because it seems like the stock just keeps on running higher recently with so much positive media coverage 1D Chart",Wow such lines and formidable couleurs - very technical and very analysis,0,0.516,0.997,POSITIVE

That gap might get filled in the relatively near term.As a high probability bull play, anyone should have bought a significant long position as soon as the price gapped up to exceed its most recent previous (Nov/Dec 2021) high point.After any blue sky breakout on strong volume, the long position benefits from the fundamental reality of, who's going to sell the stock now? ... :) Answer: Not so many, until market conditions or company circumstances change.",0,0.551,0.52,NEGATIVE

If you are comfortable investing based on speculation I think your entry points are fair. Tesla is similar, these companies will take a decade for the value to catch up to current prices.

Even the CEO said this on the initial earnings call that made everyone lose their mind.“We believe we can be a $1T company in the next decade.”And then it started trading at $1T a couple of days later. He said decade not week.They have a very large revenue goal of $11B for this next earnings release. It’s partly what caused this mania. If they don’t get close to that I personally believe the stock will be slobberknockered. If they do, then game on.",1,0.587,1.0,NEGATIVE

I'd tend to agree though, the company is a mega-giant in the making if it isn't already considered one.

Tesla is definitely in the same boat though, perhaps you're right - buying after a bigger crash might be the best play. Thanks for the input",1,0.562,0.997,POSITIVE
