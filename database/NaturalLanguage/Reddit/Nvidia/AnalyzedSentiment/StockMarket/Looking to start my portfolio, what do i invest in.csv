What I’m saying is to use a portion of your money in long term investments and use an amount your not scared to lose to day trade with and earn money you can use to put into more long term investments. Using your logic every trade would be flawless so why can’t I assume the same thing and say day trading starting with $1 isn’t a risk lol so with that being said day trading with $100 also not a risk would make more return each day on day trading then most monthly returns,4,0.543,1.0,NEGATIVE
