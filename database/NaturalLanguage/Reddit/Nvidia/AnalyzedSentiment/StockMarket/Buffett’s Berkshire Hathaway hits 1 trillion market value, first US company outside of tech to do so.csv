,"Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reached a $1 trillion market capitalization on Wednesday, the first nontechnology company in the U.S. to score the coveted milestone. Shares of the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate have rallied more than 28% in 2024, far above the S&P 500′s 18% gain. The $1 trillion threshold was crossed just two days before the “Oracle of Omaha” turns 94 years old. The shares were up 0.8% to $696,502.02 on Wednesday, allowing it to top the $1 trillion mark, per FactSet. The milestone “is a testament to the firm’s financial strength and franchise value,” said Cathy Seifert, Berkshire analyst at CFRA Research. “This is significant at a time when Berkshire represents one of the few remaining conglomerates in existence today.” Unlike the six other companies in the trillion-dollar club (Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta), Berkshire is known for its old-economy focus as the owner of BNSF Railway, Geico Insurance and Dairy Queen. (Although its sizable Apple position has helped drive recent gains.)",🐐🐐🐐,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.761
