,,Negative. They started breaking even and getting a little in the green shortly after mostly due to selling carbon credits.,2,0.502,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,The profits are like two different scale as well,1,0.534,0.958,NEGATIVE
,,I couldn't think of two more incomparable scenarios. one has eye-watering revenues and 400% YoY with some of the sexiest margins you'll ever see barreling towards the future of technology. the other had a celebrity selling cars and a brand.,1,0.524,0.786,NEGATIVE

,,Still undervalued. Every single AI company is powered by them.,0,0.654,0.876,NEGATIVE
,,"Idk they aren‚Äôt nearly as diversified in their business as other large market cap companies. They‚Äôll surely do well in the short to medium term, but I think it‚Äôs over bought. If the AI hype dies down that could have a significant impact on their stock",1,0.571,1.0,NEGATIVE

,,"My point is that because their business is less diversified, i.e., less product offerings or market areas, it makes them more susceptible to risk. It also limits their ability to grow should the appetite for their chips wane. Other businesses like the ones you mentioned have larger portfolios of revenue streams. It‚Äôs hard for me to imagine that NVDA is more valuable than a company like AAPL, or even ones like AMZN and GOOGL. I certainly expect the rate of growth from NVDA to be higher than these companies in the short term, but I‚Äôm skeptical that it will become a similar or exceeding level of juggernaut.",3,0.543,0.999,NEGATIVE

,,I‚Äôd say more like a pharma company in the sense of the importance of intellectual property,2,0.583,0.794,NEGATIVE
,,"And that's why they have 60% margin, no company wants to fork out premiums for gpus just because nvidia is a monopoly, and a competitor, or big tech's in-house chips will lower nvidia's earnings at some point.",1,0.579,0.572,NEGATIVE
,,"believe it the margin was in the high 70's.in house could be a threat eventually, competitors will chip away at the market dominance but NVDA will always be #1, and this segment is growing and will for some time. Losing market share may not be losing revenue. And if you think NVDA is sitting around idle thinking they are going to be relying only on AI earnings in 2026..well...that's cute.",2,0.551,0.535,POSITIVE
,,They have 80 billion in sales...,1,0.783,0.993,POSITIVE
,,And they sell every single unit they make and they have zero competition from Intel or AMD anytime in the near future. It‚Äôs effectively a monopoly due to their early investment into CUDA. There is no catch up for at least a few decades.,2,0.539,0.992,POSITIVE
