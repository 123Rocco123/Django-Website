,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I only hold MAG7/market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions. I use IBKR TWS for my platform and charts, please stop asking what I use. Some stocks I post may be <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific questions. Questions like “Thoughts on _____?” or “Is ___ a good investment?” will be ignored or I’ll troll you unless you add detail and your own opinion. I will block you if you are a troll. News: Nvidia Tumbles After Disappointing Forecast, Blackwell Chip Snags Mostly earnings aftermaths today. NVDA - Earnings yesterday, beat expectations but weren’t the blowout everyone expected. Executives said on the earnings call that NVDA still expects to begin earning revenue from Blackwell in this fiscal year. EPS of 0.68 vs 0.64 exp. $50B share buyback. Revenue grew close to 122% YoY. Overall, I don’t really see a reason to change one’s position if long/short. (I’m not changing mine, which is currently long.) AFRM - Reported a massive beat on earnings, following a beat on the top/bottom lines. EPS of -0.14 cents vs -0.51 cents expected, revenue of $659M vs $604M expected. Also cited a new goal of hitting operating profitability on a GAAP basis by 4th quarter of 2025. Analyst stated rate cuts would be beneficial for the company and allowed for greater loan sales. DG - Cuts outlook, blaming “financially constrained” customers. Forecast changed from $5.50-$6.20, from $6.80-$7.55. DLTR also down off this news because they trade similarly with each other. CRWD - Spiked initially due to beating quarterly estimates, but lowered FY guidance mainly due to incentives for a customer commitment package after a July 19th outage. $1.04 vs 97 cents expected. Revenue of $963.9M vs $959M expected. SMCI - Still watching after the Hindenburg Research report 2 days ago, they reported they were delaying postponing filing of their 10K. Keep in mind they could be delisted (again) because of these delays, will likely post a writeup about it this weekend.
