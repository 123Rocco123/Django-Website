Essentially no one wants to give their money to china for chips that will most certainly pose a threat to their security.... it's a hard call because you just don't know when, and of course officials in Taiwan are fighting back but it's a losing battle.... one thing one could do is do a comparison with Honk Kong legislations passed and when China made their move... and compare them to see what is still missing in their puzzle and see if its in the pipeline, when will it be discussed/voted on.. etc... but thats a lot of work... we know they wont destroy TSMC.

If taking like the bottom 10% of the market (and thatâ€™s incredibly generous and due to nvidias shortages more likely than AMDâ€™s merits) constitutes competition than I am sure nvidia is shaking in their boots. People pretend like this is a competition, I hope both companies do fantastic and when AMD seems to be in a good position relative to its price Iâ€™ll jump in - but from an investing standpoint choosing over AMD over nvidia is pants on heads stupid based on financials and outlook.",3,0.544,NEGATIVE,1.0
