,,"If there were, every single person on earth would be rich. Also, 90% of the jobs in capital markets trading would be gone.Serious answer: there are theses one can develop, but are more likely to be wrong, and take years to develop. For example: The early 2000s. Even if you had developed the idea of a smartphone like the iPhone, that’s great—but what company is going to do it? Motorola? BlackBerry?Same goes for NVDA, you could have the correct thesis about AI and the resulting chip demand, but choose AMD instead.Most stocks that end up like NVDIA are a result of game changing innovations. Samsung could’ve been what Apple is, and no one would’ve been able to actually predict it. Hope that makes sense.",1,0.542,NEGATIVE,0.999
