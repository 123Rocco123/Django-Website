But I will tell you that I’ve been doing this for a while. I started out in IB and was a health care/tech analyst for decade at AMs and HFs. Not a flex and definitely not saying I’m a good investor, or even that smart. But (actually) the biggest lesson I’ve learned is walking around with a Bear narrative just ends up leaving you on the sidelines as the market trudges forward. That ‘20% correction’ you’ve been calling for will eventually happen, the market just may be up 50% when it happens. When you’ve seen the market go up and down long enough, and heard your 3,000th ‘this is the end’ speech, you realize how durable the economy is and how entrenched many of these companies are.I actually lost a boss to this Bear mentality. The PM of the growth fund I was in had a couple big years. Was getting CNBC time, quadrupled our AUM from new investment. Felt like a star. Then he just became scared. Like he didn’t want to lose, instead of trying to win. We ran a big cash drag for two years and basically sucked all the growth names out of our book. In a competitive mutual fund landscape, that 5-10% underperformance for 2yrs was enough to get him binned. And he’s not working in the industry anymore.Fck, now that I think about it, in his last CNBC interview he talked about his SHOP short. In 2018. At $15. As the quote goes ‘many an optimist has become rich by buying out a pessimist.’",6,0.524,NEGATIVE,1.0

Viacom crashed because they went to the market for a follow on equity offering and Archegos didn’t show up to participate because they were out of dry power.
