,"In the final week of August, investors will be focused on two major events: Nvidia's earnings and the Federal Reserve's annual meeting in Jackson Hole. The Jackson Hole Economic Symposium will kick off on Thursday, with Fed Chair Jay Powell's address serving as the major event. Powell's comments on interest rates, the economy, and any indication that inflationary pressures are driving a reassessment of the Fed's present aims will be scrutinized. On the corporate front, Nvidia headlines the earnings story this week, with the chipmaker scheduled to publish data from a quarter that caused the chipmaker to increase its revenue forecast by 50%. Lowe's, BJ's Wholesale Club, and Peloton are also set to announce earnings this week. August is shaping up to be the worst month for stocks this year, with all three main averages closing last week lower after a hawkish read of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting sent equities lower and Treasury rates higher in the second half of the week. Economic data continues to come in stronger than expected, with the July retail sales report indicating a 0.7% increase in sales for the month, about double what economists forecast. The AtlantaFed's GDPNow projection now predicts third-quarter GDP growth of 5.8%, the strongest rate since the fourth quarter of 2021. Inflation has declined dramatically since Powell's Jackson Hole speech last year, when he predicted rates will climb until the ""job is done,"" lowering inflation. Powell has stated as recently as July that inflation is ""well above"" the Fed's long-run objective of 2%. On the corporate front, all eyes will be on Nvidia, which predicted that artificial intelligence demand will increase its current quarter sales projection from $7 billion to $11 billion. Nvidia stock is up about 200% year to date, but its gains have slowed along with the market since mid-July. Nvidia's earnings release in late May signaled a shift in overall market mood for the year, with Wall Street strategists becoming more overtly bullish on stock market performance in 2023.","For NVIDIA, the release of its financial data will further influence the market's expectations for the demand in the field of artificial intelligence. The upward revision of the company's forecast numbers indicates the potential of this industry. However, the article also mentions the possible impact of overall market trends on NVIDIA's stock performance.",0,0.595,0.922,NEGATIVE
