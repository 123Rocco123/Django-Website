Quantum Computing is a pioneering area of science, innovations are typically borne out of research conducted by universities and research centres that are published and reviewed.

Furthermore, even if you thought they might be diamonds in the rough - their publication records indicate that they are abysmal researchers (see above). The citation count of QUBT's entire (quantum) employee count is unable to match the citation count of individual founders from competing firms.

If you believe what the company is saying, the money from their recent capital raises are going into a foundry dedicated to processing thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) chips for use in quantum computing.

Given the relative obscurity of QUBT's employees, it is unlikely that they'll manage to either make functioning chips (which they are already falling behind on) or beat out their competitors who possess significantly more valuable patents, better manufacturing capability and greater commercial links (i.e. with Amazon, Nvidia, Google).
