,,"All hail to your new king, NVIDIA. The protector of the stock market.",0,0.675,0.995,POSITIVE
,,"We're really in a strange situation where companies that reinvest in itself and keep innovating new technologies are going to exponentially become dominant above all the other companies still doing things the old ways.One of the big things people are looking into is AI & robotics manufacturing, I mean when you get to that level of technology (which I don't think is possible right now), but the yields from that would be as incredible as the first robotic-arm manufacturing plants. However, Nvidia already demonstrated how they could 3D design a factory blueprint and turn it into a video. Just think of the value of just the ""design"" aspect (let alone a future of robot-AIs which is still far off). It's hard to fathom and why long-term investing and companies investing heavily into R&D, works so well (but works poorly in short term at times).",1,0.538,0.949,NEGATIVE
,,"It's hard to fathom and why long-term investing and companies investing heavily into R&D, works so well (but works poorly in short term at times).This is survivorship bias.There are tonnes of companies that do/did innovative work that ultimately fail for one reason or another. It's high risk-high reward. The giant companies that make it like NVDA are just one of the few that end up with their innovations being an essential technology.",2,0.538,0.972,NEGATIVE
,,"My point is that when it's a big company already and they pride themselves in reinvesting in R&D and making tons of new innovative departments and R&D projects, it tends to pay off -- because the ""survivorship bias"" happens internally.As an example, lots of Google projects fail, but some end up taking the world by storm (e.g. YoutubeMusic has done well despite tough competition, Google Pixel has done well despite the toughest competition) etc.Yes sometimes it doesn't work out for a lot of companies but you can always end up like AOL or Yahoo...",3,0.539,0.752,NEGATIVE
,,"Your argument was about why ""investing in R&D works so well"". I'm pointing out that that isn't necessarily true because you just don't see all the innovations that fail to change the world (literally 99% of pharmaceuticals fail to get to market).It's not that R&D works or not, it's that the risk is higher, so when it does work, it tends to pay off a lot more, which is how the largest companies tend to be more innovative.",4,0.542,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"Pharma fails because of how difficult they've made the human trials process through over-safetyism. And then during the pandemic, they reversed gear and made it way too easy for pharma companies developing mRNA.It just becomes a question for regulatory agencies: ""why can't you just be normal?!?!""High-risk-high-reward is usually the main option. We are too quickly becoming a low-risk high-reward society which eventually becomes a stagnant economy through culture.",5,0.515,1.0,NEGATIVE
