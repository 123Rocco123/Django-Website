,"It is my first time trading and thought Nvidia would be a good buy, lost 22.56$ today and am wondering what more experienced stock traders think on Nvidia stocks today and if I should just cut my losses","Makes sense to me. Their valuation was mostly driven by excitement around AI computing, and there's a lot more competition in that space than there was a year ago. Apple's hardware is fantastic for the average user, and some clusters simply can't use the black box around a lot of NVIDIA's drivers (I'm thinking specifically of scientific computing clusters, which need to have a greater degree of control around compute tasks to make sure the math is actually supporting the physics of the underlying problem). Almost all of the fastest computing clusters in the world are built on AMD chips for this reason. Big servers like that also care more about efficiency, as in number of computes per watt of power consumed rather than raw power. NVIDIA server components perform well in efficiency metrics, but are not absolute winners like they are in raw power per unit.In consumer graphics, they've lost considerable ground in the mid-tier, which typically sells the vast majority of units. Weirdly, Intel is the only company that is really totally focused on that market, though AMD has always been strong there.On top of all that, they've essentially lost the Chinese market with these new export bans. This honestly might be the single largest factor limiting their potential growth, because that is a massive emerging market.Good news is that there simply isn't an alternative for the 4090 for a small to mid size user that needs a lot of graphics power, and it looks like there won't be for a long time. The 4090 clearly has the highest performance on the market for tasks like video editing, animation and graphics creation, and AI workloads that can use GPU compute. It's a no-brainer for professionals in that space where shaving 10% or so off of processing time is a big deal. On top of the direct value that market has, there is a certain prestige that comes from having the highest performing product, so even their lower tier products can see a bit of a sales boost from it even if an alternative might be a better choice on paper. Since AMD is simply bowing out of the race for best consumer performance in graphics cards and Intel has no interest in joining it, I don't think this is likely to change any time soon.Still a profitable company with a solid future, but the current valuation seems really wild to me. Just to state my bias clearly, I'm a prolific NVIDIA hater due to their outright disdain of the open source community, but I don't think that has any bearing on their profitability aside from some niche applications like scientific computing.",0,0.549,0.902,NEGATIVE
