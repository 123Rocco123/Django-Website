,,"I took out a put position at 480, put a tight stop loss because it was the gamma level so you don't need a big stop loss. Then I went about my dayI heard my phone say I stopped out. I was like ""oh its one of those set ups""As a bear it's very simple, always keep an open otm call over the 9ema, try to short at what should be a heavy resistance. If a short that was high probability didn't play out, wait until sentiment meter hits extreme greed and take 50% of a position above the Bollinger with plenty of time, the other 50% 3 trading sessions later if it is still above.Below the 9 Ema you do the opposite.

,,"How many times in history has the market gone up after reaching ATHs, and made new ATHs since the last ATHs? Literally every time. How you not seen a chart of the stock market over the past 250 years? Stocks go up and they will keep going up, sometimes they go down but then they go right back up, higher than before",2,0.564,POSITIVE,0.999

,,"I see what ur saying but if u look at the SPX any further back than 30ish years, you’ll find that initial ATH breakouts tend to fail pretty badly, sometimes even making lower lows afterwards. The second test though months later is usually a smash through.",4,0.506,NEGATIVE,0.999
,,"What you’re saying is if you lessen the sample size, x happens? If ATH breakouts mostly fail badly then the market would not be where it is today. Technically any bull market is making ATHs every other day and could continue for decades. What about the 50s, 60s, 80s, 90s, 2010s.I hear what you’re saying though, what I’m trying to say is that we really don’t know, and generally over time the market goes up, not investing because it looks like it’s going to go down is usually less beneficial than just buying & DCA no matter the state of the market, time in the market beats timing the market. The other thing psychologically is usually when people say “the market looks to high, I’ll wait”, and then the market goes down, they get too scared now cause it’s going down, and say I’ll wait til it comes up again, etc. realistically, timing the market is a trap because they won’t feel comfortable investing in a down market anyway. There’s some cases though, for example if a treasury bond is paying more than a stock’s returns over let’s say 5 or 10 years, then go with that, but otherwise, just keep buying",5,0.531,NEGATIVE,0.998
,,Initial ATH breakout is what Im talking about. It’s not stupid to short the first time a level is retested even if it breaks through by a few dollars. A 10 year long ATH crawl isn’t an necessarily an initial ath breakout which is why we need to expand our data pool to include more similar situations. Where we are now is the first breakout after a major decline. A failed breakout scenario could still very well be on the table. What happens after that could be more ATHs or a bear market who knows.,6,0.534,NEGATIVE,0.999
