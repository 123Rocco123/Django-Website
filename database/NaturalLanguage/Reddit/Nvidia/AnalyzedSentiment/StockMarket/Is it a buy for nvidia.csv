I work at a startup that is focused on using AI/LLMs in e-commerce. I come across a lot of startups using AI and LLMs.I think that end-user facing AI is kind of in a downward trajectory of the hype cycle. But AI for backend processes and automation in enterprise workflows is just scratching the surface. What AI is particularly good at is understanding and making sense of unstructured data (which isn't all that different from language). Whether you're talking APIs or documents, AI can eliminate A LOT of low level human resources when applied in the right context.The question is this: will demand for AI increase or decrease over the next decade?Do you think someone is building better hardware and/or software to power that demand than Nvidia? Do you see a competitor taking their share of a growing pie?If your answer to those questions is ""Yes"" and ""No one"", then you should invest in Nvidia. Whether you can time it right or not is the question. Is it overpriced? If you buy in now, will it still be overpriced in 10 years? So whether you buy or not I think depends on your horizon.

What are your opinions?,"As well as being on a downward trajectory for the hype cycle, the models themselves are trending towards being lighter and faster as well. I'm predicting that between regular hardware getting faster and models getting streamlined, 99%+ of text and audio AI use cases will be able to run comfortably on regular high street consumer hardware within a few years.A lot of it'll still be Nvidia hardware so they're not going bust any time soon, but the days of them selling $40,000 graphics cards faster than they can make them won't last forever.",1,0.539,NEGATIVE,1.0
,So nvidia is now ranging at $102.83. I just wanna if it is a good price range to build a buying position or i should wait for more correction. What are your opinions?,"The equation isn't quite that simple. For starters, training is still very expensive and time consuming and will never be done on consumer hardware. Companies training and fine-tuning models will continue to be using the high-end hardware because it will be faster. If you want to lead in this space, you need to be able to both iterate and train quickly as well as provide faster and faster inference.Assuming inference can be done well on consumer hardware, the fact would still remain that it would be faster on high-end hardware so SaaS services will continue to compete on speed and thus will continue to drive high-end hardware, even if inference can be done locally with high competence for some subset of use cases.Working in this space, I can say that the shift from GPT-4 to GPT-4o and GPT-4o Mini in terms of throughput has been groundbreaking because it opens up a new set of use cases which were not previously possible due to the latency of GPT-4.I think we are also just at the beginning of AI generated media. It's just getting to the point where AI generated video is getting scary good. The applications of this, given another 10 years, are going to have wide ranging effects across a variety of industries from video games to television/streaming to movies to who knows. Real-time video generation is going to require ever more powerful hardware. This is what diffusion was doing 10 years ago. This is what diffusion is doing today. Industries are going to feel a tectonic shift and all of it will need hardware.I think in general, the pie grows tremendously over the next decade in a way that even if on-device inference becomes realistic, accurate, and efficient, the overall demand for high-speed and high-throughput inference on the backend will drive increasingly more capable high-end hardware. There is a point of diminishing returns, for sure, but we're not close yet, IMO.And in this space, there doesn't appear to be any competition with AMD a distant second.One risk I can see is that China has been effectively cut off and is now has some pressure to build some of these capabilities internally. Given 10 years, could they eventually surpass TSMC and Nvidia? China could also invade Taiwan. China is the biggest question mark when it comes to Nvidia's dominance, IMO.

What are your opinions?,"I’ve gotten downvoted so many times on different forums for this, but it’s not a matter of if we are in an AI bubble, we ARE in a AI bubble.I use ARM as an example. They sell their CPU architecture for dirt cheap. They worked with NVIDIA before and still work for them. It’s currently a 125 BILLION dollar company with less than 1 Billion in Revenue (edit: meant yearly earnings here, but quarterly revenue does sit around 1 Billion).Here’s the thing, ARM exists because its CPU license architecture is cheap. ARM could provide its architecture to most of the market and that wouldn’t cause their earnings to match their current market cap. If they plan newer revenue streams they probably wouldn’t kick in soon enough.Thats just one company, there are so many that won’t be leaders in AI who have talked the talk to inflate their stock prices. The street is going to want to see results and it’s not going to materialize for many. If one part of the sector massively fails, confidence even for the successful parts of the sector wanes. Everyone drops in that scenario, some much more than others.The dot com bubble involved a lot more startups, but the premise is the same. New tech led to Skyrocketing valuations which may not be substantiated soon or rather soon enough. One characteristic of investor behavior during that time is that they totally overlooked ridiculous PE ratios, assuming the companies would pick up the slack. How many companies do you see today with PE ratios over 100 or nearing 100? ARM is currently over 300. The S&P 500 also went up 20% that year too. Is this all starting to sound familiar?When the bubble burst companies like Amazon and Cisco even lost a majority of their value. Famously, Cisco lost 80%.All to say be careful, history has a funny way of repeating itself. Sure you can go with the mantra that this time it’ll be different. But I’m not too excited at this point to put all my eggs in this basket.I also work with GenAI and data science.
