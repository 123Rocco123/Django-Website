No. For me it was just a matter of looking at P/Es. Could a P/E of 210 be a little pricey for NVDA? Well, for frame of reference, Apple is also often considered overbought, and its P/E is 30…So you tell me, is nVidia’s growth potential 7x that of Apple’s?",2,0.527,1.0,NEGATIVE

Plus, Google is out here developing their own ML hardware products “TPUs”I see their AI market advantage going another 5-10 years before other competitors are threatening them as the market leader.FYI - I’m talking about business and market context within the US, not too familiar with other markets for this industry.Disclaimer: I’m invested in NvidiaSource: I consult on and build AI and data pipelines for a living",1,0.548,0.972,POSITIVE
