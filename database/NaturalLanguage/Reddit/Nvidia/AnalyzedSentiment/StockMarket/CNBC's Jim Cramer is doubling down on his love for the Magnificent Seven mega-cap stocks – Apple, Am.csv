Interest rates weigh heavily on the explosiveness of an AI startup.My inference on all of this is that AI is going to continue to elvolve positively but all of the bad players are going to be shaken out. (Bad debt and weak AI growth). Most of the growth will be seen at AWS because we (cloud engineers) will utilize more foundational-models-a-service and increase our spend with AWA in pursuit of higher returns in our respective industries.Keep in mind China is at our heels threatening us with Alibaba… idk, I will also invest there as our Chinese people are weird, but they’re onto something big.TLDR; US finance bad, AI tech positive as long as no debt load, and China is learning.
