,,"Todayâ€™s news that Morgan Stanley increased Nvidiaâ€™s rating is noteworthy, but itâ€™s worth approaching with caution, as it could still be a form of market manipulation. Over the past two weeks, bearish investors have been signaling their intentions, and now Morgan Stanley, a traditionally bullish player, is revealing its stance. Nvidiaâ€™s stock may exhibit both downward and upward trends in anticipation of earnings reports.Itâ€™s essential to wait for full confirmation before making any decisions. After all, itâ€™s your money, and you have the final say in how you use it. I offer this insight simply as a sharing of knowledge.Lately, the market has been trending in a bearish direction. Investors are understandably hesitant to lose faith, and major players may take whatever actions they deem necessary to protect their interests. They might even announce a cut in their rating after earnings are revealed, a move that would be inconsequential for them but could have broader market implications.",3,0.53,0.982,NEGATIVE

,,Never go full regard. If you hold youâ€™re going to regret it when this retests $300 and then $200.The people that bought it were large banks and funds that are now selling that to move it to blue collars/medical/money markets. Much safer assets than a big speculative bubble in NVIDIA. If they miss expectations this quarter then this thing will flop before it regains itâ€™s market Dominance and retests ATHs.,4,0.526,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,10k shares are quite still big. Even if he has good amount of money still. He must have invested thinking something. My point is right now nvidia share is dumping quite hard. Maybe if the retail investors are viewing this as an opportunity to pump a little bit and then dump it.,2,0.526,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"none of these massive funds buy (or sell) their position outright. they invest and divest over months. If they go all in all at once, they cant move the market. Also I think there legal restrictions on how much they can buy/sell without scheduling it advance with the sec, so as not to ""manipulate"" the market",1,0.556,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"If it's a 13-F (which I didnt check) most likely the filing is made for the quarter ending 30 June 2023. Maybe he has already exited by now. We'll know in about 3 months at the next 13F filing.Also, for all practical purposes the new patriarch of the family is his son. George is already like 200 years old and I bet that shriveled fuck's day to day only consists of molesting his nurses...",0,0.536,1.0,NEGATIVE

,,"He simply sold the pound first and bought it back after. Most people buy first and sell later. This was at a time when the pound was being propped up by the corrupt establishment. All his political work has been about promoting open societies and democracy. His dad got his family out of Hungary when racist right wingers started getting violent on the Jews. Some people have tried to turn him into the devil, but most appreciate his work.",2,0.516,0.908,POSITIVE

,,"The article does not mention when he did that. Could have been well before the run up. Anyway to tell when this transaction happened? For a retail investor it does not make sense to jump in now. If you are a whale though, go crazy.",0,0.518,1.0,NEGATIVE
