,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they’ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don’t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical. Yes, Nvidia’s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn’t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now. Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn’t possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia’s place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn’t happened and Nvidia’s only gotten stronger. That’s not to say over time Nvidia won’t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it’s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution. Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations. I don’t think AI is a bubble but I do think that Nvidia and the market as a whole can get ahead of themselves.

AI is such a slam dunk win for everything, Nvidia is literally selling seeds for money trees and every other tech company that spends $1 on AI chips sees $10/year in additional revenue. There's no reason to stop spending short of $1000/year for every human on earth so Nvidia should see annual revenues of at least $8T within a few years, at that point their growth rate will have to slow to the global population growth rate and inflation so a very conservative valuation is around $200T which would be a PE of only 25.",0,0.57,POSITIVE,0.853

I'm not sure software side on these server will keep up with what the hardware can offer as I'm not privy to this info.Right now for the public all we see is chatbots that can feed us info and photos. But behind the scenes I can't really tell how it's improving companies.That being said in some way they are because no company would invest 10+ billion on servers over a period of half a decade to a decade if they didn't have a use for it. Part of me think they were going to build servers anyway so why not get the AI variant chips.Would have to dig deeper to really know the impact of AI on servers at least since the lions share of chips are going to that. And I can't really tell how exactly AI will help that. I'm sure they are useful but how exactly I'm at a loss.I won't fight the market momentum and I'll keep buying semis .,0,0.568,NEGATIVE,0.999

A lot of the companies start to make their own AI chip instead of relying on nvda but probably will make a small dent on the revenue. I think the only moat that nvda has is their SW stack is sticky.

Societal guidelines and rules that have been established over the last 100 years are going to be blurred.The late 90's bubble was high stock prices based on promises. Those companies were not earning billions of dollars a year. ..a big difference.Some analysts are saying that the amount of returns on the AI investment are miniscule which points to it being a bubble ..but what they don't seem to understand is that you have to invest in laying the train tracks before you can make profit from driving a train down that track. I see current AI training, the hardware and the eco system the same as the Railway tracks they started laying in the early 1800's ..and look how much money that investment eventually made them.I've increased my Nvidia position the day before they announce earnings on multiple occasions and I'm probably going to do it again.",0,0.558,NEGATIVE,0.987
