,"Nvidia said Wednesday that its board of directors has approved a $50 billion stock buyback. The computer chip giant announced the share repurchase as part of its fiscal second-quarter earnings, in which it reported earnings and guidance that surpassed Wall Street expectations. Nvidia returned $15.4 billion to shareholders in share repurposes and cash dividends as part of the company’s first half of its fiscal 2025. The company said it had $7.5 billion remaining under its share repurchase plan, as of the end of its fiscal second quarter. Last year, Nvidia announced a $25 billion share buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results. Companies often experience a boom to their stock price after revealing stock buyback plans. In May, for instance, Apple announced a $110 billion stock buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results that showed overall sales fell 4% year over year and iPhone sales dropped 10% year over year. However, the iPhone maker’s shares rose 7% in after-hours trading, likely because Apple’s share buyback was the biggest in corporate history. With Nvidia’s shares dropping 4% in extended trading despite reporting solid financial results and announcing a stock buyback, some experts believe the company has been doing so well that it is getting harder to impress investors. Second-quarter sales rose 122% year over year to $30.04 billion, while net income jumped 168% year over year to $16.6 billion, Nvidia said.",They better do it first thing tomorrow morning.,0,0.527,NEGATIVE,0.85

Because from all the things they could invest in, they believe that their own stock is the most worth it. They know what a risk it is. It's not just free money, ""buy our own stock and we make more money from it."" Because if they are wrong and the stock becomes overvalued, it can easily crash to a more ""reasonable hypothetical price,"" and they lose money on their 50 billion investment. Even worse is if it crashes, they could have bought the stock at that price and been in an even better position. So buybacks are not free money, especially risky for companies like NVDA when they are touted for being close to overvalued due to their meteoric rise. So considering all of that, them buying 50 billion of their OWN stock makes it seem that they are so positive about their own future that they see their own meteoric stock as still being undervalued. Unless they are wrong, it sounds like great news for investors. And if they're wrong, that's a problem for many other reasons. But no one knows NVDA as well as NVDA, and unless they are doing this as a ploy to save a potential crash, this is great news. Also, not sure how legal that last thing is... But as always... who would enforce it... In that case what they definitely loose is trust I the stock and they seem like they value that..",2,0.55,NEGATIVE,1.0

In May, for instance, Apple announced a $110 billion stock buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results that showed overall sales fell 4% year over year and iPhone sales dropped 10% year over year. However, the iPhone maker’s shares rose 7% in after-hours trading, likely because Apple’s share buyback was the biggest in corporate history.

If your ahead of 2nd place by multiple miles you can just set a pace and run. You dont need to walk it, but you sure dont need to sprint.NVDA has such a big lead that it would be stupid of them to squander it by going too fast or too slow. If they go much faster people it would likely interfere with ramping up product lines and getting a good return for each cycle of product. If they go slower though someone could close the gap a bit and that would likely impact margins.I get the impression Jensen and his team understand where the sweet spot is and they are dancing around it. Folks know they can speed up so there isnt much point in trying to close the gap. When NVDA finally runs into a problem that slows down advancement at some point it will be apparent and that is when someone will try to close the gap. Discovering that problem sooner will be a double edged sword. Sure they will know sooner so can work on solving it, but others will know about it and then things will happen that wont be comfortable for shareholders.With all that in mind I dont think the buyback is a terrible idea. They dont want to change the dividend policy, so buybacks are really the only other good use they have for the huge pile of cash they are generating.",3,0.51,NEGATIVE,0.943

,"Nvidia said Wednesday that its board of directors has approved a $50 billion stock buyback. The computer chip giant announced the share repurchase as part of its fiscal second-quarter earnings, in which it reported earnings and guidance that surpassed Wall Street expectations. Nvidia returned $15.4 billion to shareholders in share repurposes and cash dividends as part of the company’s first half of its fiscal 2025. The company said it had $7.5 billion remaining under its share repurchase plan, as of the end of its fiscal second quarter. Last year, Nvidia announced a $25 billion share buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results. Companies often experience a boom to their stock price after revealing stock buyback plans. In May, for instance, Apple announced a $110 billion stock buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results that showed overall sales fell 4% year over year and iPhone sales dropped 10% year over year. However, the iPhone maker’s shares rose 7% in after-hours trading, likely because Apple’s share buyback was the biggest in corporate history. With Nvidia’s shares dropping 4% in extended trading despite reporting solid financial results and announcing a stock buyback, some experts believe the company has been doing so well that it is getting harder to impress investors.

,"Nvidia said Wednesday that its board of directors has approved a $50 billion stock buyback. The computer chip giant announced the share repurchase as part of its fiscal second-quarter earnings, in which it reported earnings and guidance that surpassed Wall Street expectations. Nvidia returned $15.4 billion to shareholders in share repurposes and cash dividends as part of the company’s first half of its fiscal 2025. The company said it had $7.5 billion remaining under its share repurchase plan, as of the end of its fiscal second quarter. Last year, Nvidia announced a $25 billion share buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results. Companies often experience a boom to their stock price after revealing stock buyback plans. In May, for instance, Apple announced a $110 billion stock buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results that showed overall sales fell 4% year over year and iPhone sales dropped 10% year over year. However, the iPhone maker’s shares rose 7% in after-hours trading, likely because Apple’s share buyback was the biggest in corporate history. With Nvidia’s shares dropping 4% in extended trading despite reporting solid financial results and announcing a stock buyback, some experts believe the company has been doing so well that it is getting harder to impress investors. Second-quarter sales rose 122% year over year to $30.04 billion, while net income jumped 168% year over year to $16.6 billion, Nvidia said.","In the last half hour of trading, companies are restricted from buying their own shares.
