,"For the first time in 5 quarters, Nvidia's forward P/E ratio has DEVIATED from a key trend. Since the AI boom in May 2023, Nvidia's forward P/E decreased each time after earnings, even as its stock price surged. Now, Nvidia has not only BROKEN the 38x forward P/E level but also REVERSED the pattern where the stock became cheaper with each earnings report. Are we underestimating its rate of growth, or have we extrapolated too far too fast?",Moon,0,0.51,0.982,POSITIVE

Until it’s not.NVDA is dominating providing tools to the AI gold rush. And as the market sweethearts, are pricing their products accordingly. Everyone buying those products complain about pricing and availability and are working on alternatives- it is a matter of time- and the real question is how long.So no, NVDA will not continue up forever. That’s a pipe dream. And once their revenue from the AI rush is impacted because of many factors, who do you think will be holding the bag? It’s great to invest in a shovel company when shovels are rare and needed. It’s another thing when everyone has enough shovels or are making their own .One thing that is not being talked about is how every company is buying AI hardware hand over fist… without actually figuring out how to bring in revenue from it. A lot of them are going to fail, and I predict a lot of that hardware is going to end up flooding back into the market.",0,0.55,1.0,NEGATIVE
