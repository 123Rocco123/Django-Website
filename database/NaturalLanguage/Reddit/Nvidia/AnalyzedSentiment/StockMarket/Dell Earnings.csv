,"I wanted to get everyone’s take on DELL (down nearly 11% after hours.) I bought 106 shares at 130.5 during their recent run. Didn’t sell today because I like their growth prospects wanted to exit around $150. The company seems solid, especially with its strength in enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure, even though consumer PC sales have been an ongoing problem. Despite this Dell has been doubling down on AI, data centers, and hybrid cloud, which I believe should set them up well for growth in 2025. They also stand to benefit from SMCI’s issues and Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure. With the growing focus on AI and enterprise tech, it feels like Dell could see steady, long-term growth and break out to that $150 range by Q2 2024. Thoughts? Should I continue to hold? Or sell during the holiday rally? My portfolio time horizon is short giving I plan to liquidate July 2024 to buy a house.",It'll recover.- HPE holder.,0,0.502,0.999,NEGATIVE

Except it was only satisfactory compared to expectations, the call proved that they were not taking any noticeable market share in their ISG segment by capitalizing on SMCI's issues despite them still growing as outlook was light . Sure Dell is still a great company and growing business, however the market just had too high expectations that resulted in this current pullback.",0,0.564,1.0,NEGATIVE
