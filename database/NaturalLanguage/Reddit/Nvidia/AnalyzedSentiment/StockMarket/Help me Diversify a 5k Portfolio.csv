,"Iâ€™m 20, and after working for roughly four summers, Iâ€™ve accumulated a decent amount of money, roughly $30k.

So it's a fund (a combination of stocks, bonds etc.) which can directly be traded via exchange / your broker. Mostly being managed passively, they are bundled around an aim / sector / index. So there are ETFs for the semiconductor industry if you want to bet on this, but also more diversified ones like on the MSCI world (bundle of the biggest companies around the globe). One stock may fail, but others will arise as the demand is still there. ETFs tend to be safer and less volatile than single stocks, which also buffers potential gain and loss. In the long term a broadly diversified ETF will be better if you can't beat the market consistently (which even professional fund managers are struggling to do).",2,0.538,NEGATIVE,0.855
