,,"AMD is surprisingly good value for the money, and right now their GPGPUs are a lot more available than NVIDIA's products.They'd be grabbing a lot more market share, I think, except for two things: Weaker market messaging, and NVIDIA's head start, which means popular LLM stacks are much better optimized for CUDA right now than they are for CDNA.",0,0.562,NEGATIVE,0.833
,,The AMD AI play is all theoretical. NVIDIA is here right now and crushing it for the foreseeable future.,1,0.609,NEGATIVE,0.984
,,"That's NVIDIA's messaging talking.AMD's had some success stories, but they've been drowned out by the cacophany of NVIDIA's bought praises.Certainly local inference on older AMD hardware is more than theoretical. The AMD Instinct MI60 with llama.cpp is entirely practical, if not very well optimized. The MI300 should jfw with it, too.",2,0.566,NEGATIVE,0.877

,,"Wake me up when AMD earnings wake up.They are even further behind than that, because the DCs building out h200/B200 have been keyed in about Rubin, and likely even further ahead, so that when the inevitable is delivered the facilities are equipped.Which means, AMDs best shot is to make products that can slot into the established NVDA shaped infrastructure.... second fiddle, playing someone else's tune, for a fraction of the earnings.AMD is NVDAs closest competition and it still isn't even close. The ingrained nature of DC specs/build outs means CSPs are currently baking in multiple years of AMD inferiority.The problem isn't that AMD narrowly missed what NVDA is getting - its that they fundamentally didn't run their business to catch this apple as it fell from the tree. They don't meet their customers where they are, as they decided its too much work/too expensive to do all that software. Where's their omniverse? Where's their self-driving stack? Where's their robotic edge computing? AMD is the commodity-product in the space, by their own decisions.Anything reactionary is far too little and way too late. They don't have a history that instills confidence in those who worry about standing up and getting RoI on DCs.",5,0.538,NEGATIVE,1.0

,,This is one of the reasons I am so bullish on Google.Google just released the sixth generation TPUs which was a 5x improvement over the fifth generation.There is going to be a huge shortage of computation for AI applications. It is what is allowing Nvidia to charge such huge margins.Google has such a strong strategic position with the TPUs compared to all their competitors.,0,0.534,NEGATIVE,0.998
