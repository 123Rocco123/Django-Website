Thanks for the advice!","Instead of keeping something like 50% in checking accounts / saving accounts + 50% in stocks/investments (or some other combo) diversify it a bit of it (5-20%) with gold or other precious metals. And even shit hits the fan won't be a danger.(one more tip: stop keeping your money in shiitty checking accounts (that's highway robbery by the bank), get a good savings account with a high-yield % of savings 4%++, don't get duped by big banks who offer you no interest).And this comes from old tradition, you can ask people who've lived in wartorn regions what they do, and basically they distrust banks a bit, so they always have a cache of gold coins/bars and gold/diamond jewels somewhere for ""eras of war""... You'll be fine even with shit hitting the fan.Unless the electricity goes out which means water goes out, but hey, there's backup generators for that. And if you're that paranoid just move super rural.Also one more thing don't get so paranoid about life, you can't take your riches to heaven, so try to actually use the money and enjoy it--don't just be like ""oh I'm collecting all my money for my kids.""

If the interest rate is higher than average returns on mutual/market funds, that debt is losing you more money than the average (safe) investment would yield you. The stock market on average grows ~10% a year, mutual funds that reflect whole exchanges (s&p 500, Dow jones, etc) will pretty closely mirror that growth.
