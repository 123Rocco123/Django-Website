,"Every trader wants to know when the trend is changing from up to down or down to up. This happens when the leadership in the market changes from bulls to bears or bears to bulls. These trend changes are what every trader looks for. If they can accurately predict market turns, they can profit. That’s why they do what they do. Sometimes this change of leadership is slow and takes a long period of time to happen. These changes have price action that tends to show up on a chart as a ‘Rounded Top’ or ‘Rounded Bottom’ pattern. Sometimes the reversal is abrupt and takes place over a few time periods. This action tends to show up on a chart as a ‘V’ or ‘Inverted V’ reversal. But sometimes the trend changes just in one day... These dynamics can show up on a chart as a ‘Reversal Day’ pattern. One may have just happened in the stock of Nivida (NVDA). The Western world would call it an ‘Outside Reversal Day’. In candlestick terminology, it is called a ‘Bearish Engulfing Pattern’. It’s important to note that these candlestick patterns are at least 700 years old. They were developed by Japanese rice traders. It shows that the human nature which is illustrated in charts hasn’t changed. The name doesn’t matter. The action that it illustrates does. On Friday morning, it looked as though the uptrend in NVDA was going to continue for yet another day. It opened at a higher price than Thursday’s close. But then the tide turned… Over the day, the sellers came out of the woodwork. And not only did they hold off the assault. They overpowered the buyers and eventually pushed the price much lower. Importantly, Friday’s closing price was lower than Thursday’s opening price. This is frequently a characteristic of a trend that is reversing. Sometimes the change of leadership from bulls to bears happens over an extended time-period. But sometimes it occurs in just one day. That could be the case here.",This sounds chatGPT af,0,0.507,0.605,NEGATIVE

If Jay Powell had said ‘75bps interest rate cuts tomorrow’ the candle would be different that if Jesus H Christmas rose up and his first words were AI IS THE DEVIL’S WORKSHOP! That would be a candle to see.Kidding aside I follow technicals and hope to see support in the next few days.,0,0.551,0.979,POSITIVE
