,,"You're assuming that they will eventually grow enough to justify their current valuation. 100% the reason why it sits at $700 is because they were the first, and up until now, they had no competition. That's no longer the case, and there's a ton more heat coming their way. They can't produce more due to fab constraints, and viable alternatives are already on the market with a lot more coming, and they charge a fraction of the price.The only scenario that allows them to keep growing their margins is if they stay so far ahead technologically that the price to performance beats paying 5x what the competition charges AND they can eventually scale production. Analysts and stock holders are expecting exponential growth that isn't realistically possible. It's only a matter of time before it goes the way of Tesla.
