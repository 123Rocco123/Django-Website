In addition I hold a small amount of BTC which slightly helped my gains %","The value of advertising on popular social media is high. Meta market cap roughly 1.41 T by market close Friday. Rddt was 25.75 billion. Obviously there's a lot of work to do to become that valuable, but in terms of popularity it's one of the three best worldwide if I'm not mistaken. I'm bullish to the point that I think it will surpass meta just on the value of the conversations held here training capable a.i./advertising potential/creator space potential. But if you think that, right at this moment, based on current performance and forward guidance, that it's even 1/14th as valuable as meta, that would mean right now you value it at 4x it's current cost. When it was even cheaper I felt that much more strongly about it, however just because of my personal investing philosophy I haven't been able to put much more in for a while now. (I just like to evenly invest amongst my picks)",3,0.535,0.932,POSITIVE

Don't be afraid of the threat from China. Diamond hands on TSMC just like me. I have 2000 shares in TWSE and keeps going.I have held AAPL 100 shares and GOOG 200 shares since their stock splits. I just started to accumulate NVDA and ARM this month for 5 shares each. Hopefully, I will have small fortune by 2030.I got 3 stocks(INVZ/AMBP/RNW) from SPAC since IPO but they were still losing money. Let's see how these three babies will grow by 2030 too.

They're making tons of investment in wildfire prevention and have infrastructure that is hard to compete with in the area. And California will be in dire need of energy,1,0.552,0.996,POSITIVE
