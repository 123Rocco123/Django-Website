,,"You pay taxes on your gains when you sell your sharesIf the total profit is say 3000$, and capital gains is at 50%, you pay taxes on 1500$. If your tax bracket is 30%, thats about 500$ due next year.Instead, if you hold and don't sell, that 500$ growing at say 8% will give you an extra 40$ by the end of next year compounding for as long as you don't sell",3,0.565,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"You're maybe just using imaginary numbers but there is no way it's 50% tax if you're American. With these percentage gains they are likely long term gains so it would be 15%. Even if they were short term gains, the amounts are so small it makes me think OP probably isn't high income so their tax bracket even on short term gains is probably in the 22-24% range.That said, with this risky of a portfolio NEVER make investment decisions based on taxes. You could hold a stock to wait for it to go long term to save 7% in taxes and meanwhile the stock drops 10%. The opposite can be true too, you figure it's already long term so taxes are fixed at 15% and sell and then it shoots up more.There are only some rare conditions where you should be concerned about taxes and it's minimal. Things like getting laid off so you'll have a down income year that puts you in a lower bracket for short term gains. Stuff like that.",4,0.541,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"You're right, I'm in Canada and we don't have short/long term gains taxes anymore and a blanket 50% capital gains tax on all equity returns but it's conceptually similar to the USI agree with your point on not making decisions primarily on tax loss harvesting. I was responding to how ""not selling helps save money"" in a broad sense",5,0.528,0.83,NEGATIVE
,,Agree to this. I made a mistake of not selling my espp to save taxes when it was high and now the stock is lower than my purchase price.Not selling to save taxes is a bad decision,5,0.528,0.818,NEGATIVE

,,"Yep! But when you sell that eventuallySo assume that the 40$ you earned in my hypothetical here is realized and sold in 2026, 20$(here in Canada) of that gain will be added to your annual income and you'll have to pay 30% of that 20$ in taxes in 2027 - 6$",5,0.516,0.977,NEGATIVE

,,As you are getting close to retirement converting some in Dividend stocks could be a good options and regarding the selling you can sell it and you will just have to put the 20% capital gains tax at max no matter the amount is and if it's less then 500k then you have to just pay 15% tax which is reasonable.,5,0.516,0.997,NEGATIVE

,,"If you have descendants then it's best to never sell tbh. When you die the cost basis gets reset and none of the taxes on gains are collected.That said most people don't think like that. It's probably a good idea for you to sell some and rebalance. Be careful about realizing the gains. Depending on which state you're in (e g. WA), there's additional taxes if you exceed a certain amount (250k>).Also, the ACA tax applies if you make a certain amount (250k as a single), which you probably won't after you retire. So it could be preferable to defer sales until then.I usually rebalance at the end of the year and try to take advantage of tax loss harvesting, but I also have a slew of unrealized long term gains that I'm sitting on. Everyone has their own unique set of circumstances.",5,0.552,1.0,NEGATIVE

,,Great idea. You’ll be diversified and have international exposure too. 40% of S&P 500 revenue is from overseas. On average if you include dividends the S&P 500 returns about 10% annually we are in a bull market so you can do better than that the next few years.
