Companies like NVIDIA are positioned to support and drive this future in ways that weren't previously possible, and the valuation reflects the anticipation of that long-term value.Actually I was eyeing on grapic cards years ago due to blockchain tech but the shift on tech advancements seems to be too fast. AI, in particular, has become a major transformative force globally, and NVIDIA’s hardware is central to making those AI advancements possible. Investors are betting on the immense potential of these technologies to redefine industries and create value far beyond traditional measures of inventory or locations. I'm betting on tech products like chip creating companies.Another thing. Comparing a country’s GDP to a company’s market cap is misleading because they measure different things: GDP represents the total annual economic output, while market cap reflects a company’s current market value based on future growth expectations. NVIDIA’s market cap is high because investors see long-term potential in its AI and GPU technologies, which are anticipated to drive future growth across many industries. GDP covers a nation’s entire economy, whereas a company’s market cap focuses on its perceived value, making direct comparisons between them inaccurate.",0,0.543,POSITIVE,0.588

For NVIDIA to continue its climb, it would need to sustain an exceptionally high level of growth in revenue and profit, likely through both innovative products and expanding into new AI-driven markets. Ultimately, its valuation reflects a high-stakes bet on these future possibilities, but that growth is not guaranteed, making it a risk that some view as potentially overpriced if they’re more cautious about the speed or scale of AI adoption.Whether NVIDIA is overpriced depends largely on how investors view its potential for future growth and the value they see in emerging markets like AI and machine learning. NVIDIA’s stock price is built not just on current earnings but on expectations of continued leadership and innovation in these areas, which investors believe will drive substantial profits over time.

NVIDIA has 30,000 (probably way less now that they’re all quitting since they’re millionaires thanks to their ridiculous shares) You can call me stupid if you want but there’s no way NVIDIA’s AI products are worth anything close to $1 billion let alone a trillion…. How can this company be worth 3.5 trillion dollars. They earned $30 billion in earning for 2024… that’s not even close to a trillion let alone 3. Home Depot should be a trillion dollar company with that logic. I just don’t get how this company grows to the biggest company in the literal world in the matter for 3-5 years selling GPUs and AI. And I get they have a good financial year or two lately but that’s no reason to be 3.5 trillion.",How is it future value when it’s the current value. If the stock is $140 today it’s $3.5 trillion today. Not $3.5 trillion 5 years from now. Bc 5 years from now it’ll be whatever it’s worth then on the stock market.,1,0.593,NEGATIVE,0.859

NVIDIA is held in dividend funds, value funds, global growth funds. The industry has turned into a closet index due to fears of underperforming. It’s really really hard to buy anything but the Fab 7 if you’re dollar cost averaging into a managed or passive instrument.Stair case on the way up, elevator on the way down.",0,0.529,NEGATIVE,0.999

In the case of companies like NVDA, you should look at it more like a product with it's value being what people are willing to pay for it. Some of it is simply it's market position and being owned in probably 90%+ of mutual funds and ETFs, some are betting on insane future profits, some are betting on short term gain, and some are simply playing the volatility. All of that is driving the price up. Will it fall eventually? Logic says it should but those on the ride up can afford to sell after peak on the way down and still make insane profits while those waiting on the sidelines miss out.",0,0.526,NEGATIVE,1.0
