,"Big model pre-training bottleneck: Silicon Valley AI labs are generally struggling with new model training, with OpenAI's Orion and Google's Gemini 2.0 failing to significantly outperform their predecessors, defying the ‚Äúlaw of scaling‚Äù. This law used to mean that model performance would continue to increase with data and computation, but the scaling effect has now plateaued. Computing in the reasoning phase: To overcome pre-training bottlenecks, OpenAI and other labs are exploring ‚Äúcompute on test‚Äù techniques that enable human-like multi-step reasoning by allowing models to generate and evaluate multiple possibilities in real-time during the reasoning phase. This approach can be used more effectively for complex tasks such as mathematics and coding to optimize reasoning performance. Hardware Demand Shift: Market demand is likely to shift from large-scale pre-training clusters to inference clouds as new technologies reduce parameter requirements. This will weaken NVIDIA's monopoly in the training chip market, and the inference chip market may see more competition, especially as companies such as Groq may fill the new demand. Capital Trends: Venture capital organizations are highly concerned about this change, and are gradually investing more resources in distributed inference clouds to cater to the distributed server needs of inference computing.","I read somewhere about 6 months ago that to simulate the inference capability of a lab rat takes enough storage space to fill up a football field.So yeah, until there is more technological advancement, distributed models will be more viable for use cases. That will change overnight at some point, but to be first...",0,0.514,NEGATIVE,0.997
