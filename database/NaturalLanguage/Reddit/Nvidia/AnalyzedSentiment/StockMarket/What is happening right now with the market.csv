The resulting figure is a double top, which confirms the previous belief that the market can't get past that price, and that's when the big crash begins because now everybody is firmly convinced that the self fulfilled prophecy is happening because of some fundamentals that are found afterwards.",0,0.537,NEGATIVE,1.0

One popular site would be Forex Factory. Today Jerome Powell will give a speech. Markets are always nervous when a Fed Chair starts talking. We are expecting a possible rate cut come September. However Jerome Powell hasn't made it official. Hence the downturn in the markets. If Jerome Powell approves the rate cut we should see a rally. However if its a vague statement or denial.
