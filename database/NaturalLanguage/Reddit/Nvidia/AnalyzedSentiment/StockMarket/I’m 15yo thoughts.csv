Also, make sure you do your own research on stocks. Don’t trust the guys on the financial networks that are pushing a stock unless they give a reason you believe in. In all honesty, you’re probably best off investing in ETF’s or the S&P 500. The SP500 is one of the safest ways to grow wealth & you have an amazing head start vs. most people. So many ppl don’t think about investing until they’re in their late 20’s/early 30’s so you’re doing great!!",5,0.523,POSITIVE,0.763

I graduated high school 07' and what I was taught how to balance a checkbook. I had zero idea about the stock market, and didn't care.Because? Somehow it doesn't seem important to teach critical aspects of sections of economics.Like he said before, most people don't start investing until they are twenty or thirty. It was 34 for me (now 35) my ADHD brain said ""wait how tf does the stock market work? Screw it. I'm going to learn"".Made 200 dollars from May to the beginning of this year. Absolutely nothing. But I made 200 dollars while learning.This year I've supplemented my firefighter salary by 50% plus by listening to people like the comment above.Stick to it. Teach yourself, don't mess with options until you have mastered them so well that while paper trading you are that good. I haven't even started.For 15 years old I'm jealous.

,Everything has 1 share besides asts (2) and bought nvidia at 877 b4 the split so I have 10 shares now,"Good stuff.You’ve got plenty of time to figure it out but I think you could benefit a lot from putting about 10% - 20% of your portfolio into some ETFs.Basically allows you to still make your individual stock picks and have fun with it, but also will solidify some “guaranteed/ safe” gains.But like I said you’ve got tons of time to figure out what your strategy will be.",4,0.557,POSITIVE,0.999

,Everything has 1 share besides asts (2) and bought nvidia at 877 b4 the split so I have 10 shares now,"It’s pretty tech heavy for a long term portfolio with 6 out of 8 being tech (plus Amazon is basically tech too) but it’s a nice start. The truth is nobody here knows where any of these companies will be in 10 years. I personally LOVE Goog, if I had to pick one company that will be the biggest in the world in 10 years that’s who I’d pick (as long as government doesn’t force a break up). I also bought AMZN and NVDA starter positions last week, obviously great companies that are printing money.ERJ looks like a Brazil plane manufacturer? Personally I think investing in a Brazilian company is sketch as hell, there’s a lot of political risk there but I know nothing about the company. If you know it and like it for some reason, go for it. The chart speaks for itself, it looks great.ASTS I personally think is a stupid company but I’m biased because growing up my family had satellite internet for over a decade and it was straight up trash. I feel like ASTS will be a huge disappointment but I don’t actually follow the tech so I’m probably wrong.",2,0.55,NEGATIVE,0.672

I would encourage you to continue buying individual stocks over funds - not because your performance will be better (it maybe won’t be) but because it will keep you interested. At your age, I think that’s the most important thing.Buy companies you like. Blue chips like AMZN and GOOG have much much less risk, so keep those as your bread and butter. Risky stocks should be a small part of your portfolio, if at all. Buy companies you are a customer of or at least know what they do. That way when they dip, you won’t freak out.Lastly, don’t invest to be rich when you’re 20. Play the long game. Invest to be rich when you’re 65. It seems a lifetime away, but it will come faster than you think. And in the meantime, maybe you’ll find yourself rich at 40.Good luck.",0,0.526,POSITIVE,0.982
