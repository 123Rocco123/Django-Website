,NVIDIA is down $1T from its all time high. Is it a regular correction or AI was a bubble thats popping?,"From Dan Niles (@DanielTNiles)- he was on CNBC this morning. He has always seemed level headed.$NVDA: During the internet infrastructure buildout, $CSCO revs increased ~15.5x over 5+ years from the end of 1994 to its peak and the stock rose ~4000%. Nvidia, since the end of 2022 when ChatGPT was introduced has seen revenues go up ‚Äúonly‚Äù ~4.5x with the stock up over 600% over the past 1 ¬Ω years. I believe the ultimate peak is still several years in the future. However Cisco‚Äôs stock had intra-year declines of 26% in late 95, 38% in early 97; and 37% in late 98 during periods when growth slowed. I anticipate similar volatility for Nvidia over the next several years while both the revenues and stock more than double over that time as the AI buildout continues. Also unlike Cisco that had multiple competitors back then in Alcatel, Lucent and Nortel to name just a few, $NVDA is in a class of its own today. I expect them to beat revenue/EPS expectations in their July quarter and to guide above current expectations for the October quarter when they report in late August.",0,0.565,NEGATIVE,0.797

The proper questions you need to answer are:(1) do I believe in AI moving forward and understand this market?(2) am I a long term investor in this field?If your answer to both is yes, then congratulations. You are on your way to becoming a more savvy investor in this field. Stop freaking out over every little dip and play the long game. Stock dips offer opportunity to buy it while it‚Äôs on sale.When the market is greedy, be fearful. When the market is fearful, be greedy.",0,0.556,NEGATIVE,0.999

,NVIDIA is down $1T from its all time high. Is it a regular correction or AI was a bubble thats popping?,Forgive my ignorance but are you saying to buy NVIDIA and hold because it‚Äôs likely to eventually go up besides the occasional dip? Im brand spanking new to investing and Ive been looking at NVIDIA stocks because it feels sort of self explanatory to invest in newish technology such as AI and large tech corporations.,1,0.556,NEGATIVE,0.993
,NVIDIA is down $1T from its all time high. Is it a regular correction or AI was a bubble thats popping?,"I would say you‚Äôre curious to learn rather than ignorant, and learning is always a good thing. Historically, funds that track the S&P 500 average about 8-10% growth per year. This includes the largest 500 companies in the world and many of the tech stocks that are currently dropping. You will reach peaks and valleys over time, but the savvy investor understands this and doesn‚Äôt overreact to what happens on a day-to-day basis.Will there be times to sell? Yes, but it depends on everyone‚Äôs unique financial situation. Selling a stock because it goes down and buying a stock because it goes up is a sure way to lose money if you‚Äôre only buying at the peaks and only selling at the valleys. It‚Äôs better to continuously invest your money over time in automated transfers from each paycheck rather than time the market. I can‚Äôt stress this enough. You also need to invest in industries that you understand and invest with your risk tolerance in mind.",2,0.544,POSITIVE,1.0

,NVIDIA is down $1T from its all time high. Is it a regular correction or AI was a bubble thats popping?,"I think a lot of people think of investing like some sweaty nerd day trading in their basement with high-risk stocks. That‚Äôs not it at all. Day trading is a form of gambling. Sure some people are intelligent enough to do it and have enough information, but for 99% of the population it is a losing game.Investing in highly diversified index funds is not gambling. It‚Äôs been proven over 100 years that we can expect on average 8-10% returns per year. Sure some years will go down, but other years like last year will boom. The only way you lose your money on a fund that tracks the S&P 500 with the top 500 stocks is if we enter a complete worldwide economic apocalypse, and at that point the fall of humanity will be much more of a concern.",4,0.536,NEGATIVE,1.0
