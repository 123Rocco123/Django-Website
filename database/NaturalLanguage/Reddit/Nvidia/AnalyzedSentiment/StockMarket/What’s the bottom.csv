,Nvidia at its lows? ðŸ¤”,Only smart comment here. Pelosi one coming close second.It hit resistance at 101 and already bouncing back up. All big tech have reported increased spending on their products. Hard to miss earnings now. The post is moved to 1-2 year guidance.,1,0.568,NEGATIVE,0.981
,Nvidia at its lows? ðŸ¤”,"I have been around, investing since I was a kid back in the late 70's.A quick perception. Supply and demand will always tell you the truth. And I have to admit, Nvidia behavior reminds me of the beautiful times of the 6502, 8088 and 68000 chips , we were young, full of hope and loved every day because the nukes were going to drop.So understand the supply chain needed by the chips Nvidia makes and learn who is buying them.You have no idea what a beautiful moment you're in right now if you're thinking 2 to 7 years outHow I traded chip stocks back in the day, and still to this day, is using simple trend following spreadsheets (visi-calc & lotus 1 2 3) and when the trend was down, I would write deep in the money calls.Did I get burned a few times, yes very much so. Did I enjoy a huge long-term return, very much so.I am very positive to say, that my cost basis is less than 20 cents a share. And the dividends have been reinvested consistently. But the stock is for me way too volatile to enjoy. It requires that I look at it daily. Not something that I really wanted to do now that I'm older.",0,0.533,POSITIVE,0.6
,Nvidia at its lows? ðŸ¤”,Are you saying youâ€™re selling deep ITM calls on Nvidia? Isnâ€™t this extremely risky if it starts to trend upward again? Also whatâ€™s to stop someone from exercising the call and screwing up your cost basis? Maybe Iâ€™m missing something and you can explain.,1,0.524,NEGATIVE,1.0
,Nvidia at its lows? ðŸ¤”,"Fear of being called away is possible Back on the 31st, I was able to write some 80 calls, expiring in December for $37.50 , by that day is closer we're probably worth closer to 47. But because I was expecting a downtrend, now they're worth 31. And they'll probably start losing some value once the volatility starts shrinking. I'm really not worried about being called away they got too much time value. Also another thing that I do is I ratio with puts. I bought the 90 puts what about 40% of the premium I've collected.It really does help buying those puts. Because currently those puts went from four and a half to eight and a half.When the time comes I'll close out the position. When I feel that the trend has changed",2,0.521,NEGATIVE,0.948
,Nvidia at its lows? ðŸ¤”,"Nice! Thanks for sharing your strategy this is great. I havenâ€™t sold options but I was considering trying it out sometime. Do you hold these calls until December or are you selling (or is it called buying back?) them before that date? This is interesting, it seems this is a good way to make some extra cash off shares I already own.",3,0.52,POSITIVE,0.871
,Nvidia at its lows? ðŸ¤”,"Because I'm a trend follower, I'm just following the signal that I have used for years.So usually I try to write it 17% to 20% deep in the money call. I also use some of the funds received to purchase puts. Those are between 12% and 17% and are based on the consolidation areas of the chart. So while there is some science, it's a little bit of witchcraft kicked in.And if necessary, I roll the options. Because I get two signals a month, I'm more or less know what I have to do. So let's say I am 75 days ( 2 months and 15 days) into the sell signal, I reevaluate the option position, and maybe roll it 90 days forward. On the buy signal, I close the option positions, and pay the taxes or park the loss.The goal is to have the protection, and the little bit of cushion right as a transfers from a sell to a buy ( think of it as a sideways move ), that little bit of cushion has enough premium that when I buy it back, it won't be painfulDuring the crash of 87 the market went down 21% . But it ended up settling at around 16 or 17% I can't remember. But that's why I use that number.",4,0.541,NEGATIVE,0.998
,Nvidia at its lows? ðŸ¤”,"Back to around 50, where it was at the beginning of the year.",0,0.682,NEGATIVE,0.724
,Nvidia at its lows? ðŸ¤”,"If you study history. Even in the recession of 1982, computers ( big iron ) and PCs were being bought like crazy.I am comfortable with the concept of thinking that we are in something similar for the past few years, and we are just watching one of the most beautiful-est moments for technology to grow.I was around to see 1976 and onwards as a kid.I can only imagine the wonderment of these new generations and what amazing things will happen.Just the thoughts of fuel efficiency through AI, is an astounding thing.And, these type of chips are already being used in logistics efficiency. And the gains there should be amazing also.The self-driving cars, personally because I come from the horsepower age, I think that the efficiencies are already achieved, and it's just more high horsepower CPUs to get better driving success and collision avoidance.I don't know where the world is going to but it looks like it's going to be amazing. I hope I last long enough to see some of the things that I dream.",1,0.531,POSITIVE,1.0

,Nvidia at its lows? ðŸ¤”,NVDA probably heads back to 90 before earnings. From there it depends on the results. Another smash should give some support to SOX. Otherwise any HINT of a weaker 2025 than expected and it could be down another 20-30% in a month.,0,0.527,NEGATIVE,1.0
