,"Oracle lifted its fiscal 2026 revenue forecast on Thursday, pushing its stock up nearly 6% in after-hours trading. The tech giant now anticipates at least $66 billion in revenue for fiscal 2026, about $1.5 billion higher than analysts’ estimates. Looking further ahead, Oracle projects over $104 billion in revenue by fiscal 2029, along with a 20% year-over-year growth in earnings per share. Speaking at the Oracle CloudWorld event in Las Vegas, CEO Safra Catz expressed confidence in achieving these ambitious targets, pointing to new partnerships that allow Oracle’s database software to be offered through major cloud providers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Oracle’s strong performance continued this week as its stock gained roughly 15% over the past three trading days, setting a new record and marking a 55% increase for the year—second only to Nvidia among large-cap tech companies. Oracle’s cloud infrastructure revenue jumped 45% last quarter, outpacing its competitors and benefiting from businesses transitioning their workloads to the cloud. The company is also positioning itself to capitalize on the growing demand for artificial intelligence, announcing its cloud unit has secured orders for over 131,000 next-generation Nvidia GPUs. As Oracle scales up its cloud and AI capabilities, it plans to double its capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 to support this growth, signaling continued momentum in its expansion efforts.

They are the worst to deal with and some of their apps are designed to make the user experience miserable.Pass.,0,0.581,NEGATIVE,1.0
