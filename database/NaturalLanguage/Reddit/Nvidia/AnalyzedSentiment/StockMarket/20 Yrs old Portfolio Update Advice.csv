,"Hey guys so i’ve taken some advice from the last time i posted and decided to cut out google from my holdings because i’ve seen the impact that chatgpt has had especially through my experience on my college campus seeing the increased use. I’ve added PLTR before the induction into the S&P after carefully consideration and research I believe that it could be a great player in the future especially after reading about how effectively it reduces the time of underwriting at insurance companies from 2weeks to 2hours. I believe that other companies will eventually have to invest in their products and services, maybe not now, but certainly in the future and this isn’t including their military side. I’m iffy on holding NVIDIA because of how much hype it’s gotten this year but it’s hard to gage how much demand is needed , i have no problem holding for the next year but after that I might sell. I’ve added 6 more shares of CRWD because I genuinely think that bigger companies in this day and age cannot operate without Cybersecurity. The last company i worked at (Cigna) uses Crowd-strikes malware scan and in the midst of CRWDs downturn with delta etc i had a good feeling that it would recover. AMZ remains my biggest holding and i think it’s still so undervalued. I’d like to hear your guys perspectives on the balance of my portfolio. In the coming months i want to invest $100-200 a month into VOO, BRK and SCHD but i want to hear opinions because my goal is growth and i have a long horizon and don’t plan on selling.",if you want to keep your stocks sure. makes investing fun. but from here on out try to make VOO like 70+ percent of your portfolio,0,0.541,NEGATIVE,0.651

Ur too young and if ur not trading or buying and selling so much, id say keep it up. Im also 20 turning in feb and my portfolio rn: 20 shares of nvdia, 12 googl, 5 crm, 6 amzn, 2 V, and 5 smh. I recently sold since we’re going into elections, so that i can buy any dips from my list: crwd, googl, amzn, nflx, tsm, & bkng. any good drop from either would be good to buy since trump is threatening with tariffs and harris w/ corporate taxes. Also, these will probably keep growing since nothing in their fundamental’ showing any reason to not out perform spy other than the high prices which might get investors to sell on elections just to buy back after. So, if ur for the long term, then take a little care and not just put in indices. I watch Joseph Carlson and the plain bagel. They’re great if u don’t got all the time to do research urself.",0,0.522,NEGATIVE,0.999
