(unless otherwise noted in these tickers) To clarify since I've been asked: I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel: they're just my perspective of where a stock could potentially go. Percentages signify what the stock is trading at when I write up the report and are NOT predictions of stock price EOD. Some of the stocks I post are <$500M market cap and are NOT good long-term investments, but are good candidates to day trade. News: Nvidia Rally Rekindles AI Frenzy in Stocks Not much to watch today besides the AI stocks. NVDA- Blowout earnings and we broke past that $750 level I was interested in. From here? I genuinely don’t know where we’re going to go, but obviously still worth watching for the foreseeable future. Will be watching $800 level closely. This has dragged SMH/SOXL/AMD/the entire market up with it. **RIVN-**Poor earnings, laying off 10% of workforce, Lucid production has underwhelmed. Musk has posted that he expects Rivian to go bankrupt in about a year and a half. Projected to product 9k vehicles, down from 14K. SMCI- We’re making another leg up- thinking of making a small long from 900, but other than that I don’t want to be short until we break previous highs AMD- Up in conjunction with NVDA, small level I’m watching around 180-181- nothing clear cut. Earnings today: BKNG, EIX, NE",Appreciate your posts. Thank you.,0,0.5,0.942,POSITIVE
