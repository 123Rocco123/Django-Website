,,"why make it more complicated? Just ask yourself...- NVDA fPE is 35, and PEG is .7. These are not nosebleed territory for the stock- Street is estimating 60% rev growth this year and 25% rev growth next year. Are they over or under estimating?- Street has 800-900 price target.- If they are underestimating and Jensen guides higher, the stock goes higher.That's it.",0,0.606,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"Yep, I agree.Playing devilâ€™s advocate, Iâ€™d say the risk is that competition heats up in GPUs and margins get crunched. Their ecosystem and software make them super entrenched, but who knows where that will stand in 10yrs (and start to be priced in much earlier). Also, doesnâ€™t TSMC make literally all their chips? Bit of supplier risk.Anyway, all the people saying the stock is in crazy bubble territory are out to lunch. 50% higher valuation than S&P but 10x the EPS growth.",1,0.526,0.997,NEGATIVE
,,"Does anyone know what will happen 10 years from now? Let's be honest, we can barely predict 3 years out for any tech. What is most likely is that in 2024 and 2025, NVDA will command 90% of the AI GPU chips market. The next two years will see massive ramp up from Mag7, foreign corps and govs.Sure, China could invade Taiwan and TSM could become a China company. Th entire stock market will crash at that point, not just NVDA. I don't see that happening this year or next. Within 10 years, sure.Competition will eat away at margins, sure. New software will improve efficiency of existing chips, sure. But in the next 1-2 years? Unlikely.Own it for 1-2 years and get out. Chips are cyclical. There is no doubt NVDA, along with every other chip stock will crash. But in the next 1-2 years? Unlikely.",2,0.567,0.997,NEGATIVE
,,I think thatâ€™s all fair to say. TSMC comment was more based on them waking up and deciding to monopoly price things. Hope we get some better diversification options within chip fabs,3,0.52,0.999,NEGATIVE
,,"my man, the 10 year horizon no longer is relevant for most. This isn't 1989 where you buy and hold for 30 years. Especially in tech. A new company can literally pop up tomorrow that can make NVDA obsolete. Odds are against it, but recent history is littered with high flying tech companies that basically became obsolete because smart people, often breaking away from said company, started a new company that came out with a far better product and boom, game over.If you want to go long for 30 years, buy microsoft, the end.",2,0.61,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"Not really sure it was like that back in the day. Iâ€™m sure mutual funds and institutional AM were always pretty active. If anything I think holding periods have gone up due to more fundamentally driven investment approaches. When my old boss would talk about his boss when he was coming up, money management sounded like the Wild West",3,0.509,0.996,NEGATIVE

,,Great long term stock. Iâ€™m a holder of 412 sharesâ€¦ but this thing gonna correct in 2024. Probably will hit 500 againIâ€™ve held it along time and part of nvidia game is huge runsâ€¦. And huge crashes ðŸ˜‚,0,0.541,0.994,POSITIVE
,,"When did NVDA have a huge crash? 2022 wasn't a great year, but it was a down year across the board.",1,0.649,0.991,NEGATIVE
,,Ummâ€¦. When it went from almost 400 to 100Look at the charts,2,0.508,0.995,NEGATIVE
,,"Did that. All charts in my brokerage interface go back 5 years at most and don't show it going from 400 to 100. There's ~$120 in 10/2022 down from around $335 a year earlier. That's the closest it gets to the numbers you're mentioning, and it's a one time occurrence drawn out over nearly a year during an overall bear market. That's the only thing that comes close to what you're describing, which doesn't exactly paint the roller coaster ride picture you're painting, unless there's an actual time it went from $400 to $100 that isn't really part of a larger trend.Strictly speaking, you're correct there was a crash, though your implication it's very volatile doesn't really make sense since it was up ~50% in the three years leading up to that and is up >500% in the 2 years and change since.",3,0.536,0.996,NEGATIVE
,,Been a long time holder. Iâ€™m very bullish but as mentioned the charts show large swings and for someone who is new to this stock if you feel like there wonâ€™t be massive corrections in this stock you donâ€™t understand the marketItâ€™s market cap when from a few hundred billion to almost 2 trillion quickly. The chart of this stock goes straight up. You gonna buy at these levels? Go for it. Good luck . Long term it will probably do ok but not alot of money to be made on this one. If it double from here do the math of the companies valuation,4,0.56,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"Been a long time holder. Iâ€™m very bullish but as mentioned the charts show large swingsIt shows a large swing, as pointed out, though one that's not that unusual given it was a bear market.and for someone who is new to this stock if you feel like there wonâ€™t be massive corrections in this stock you donâ€™t understand the marketWho said that? What are you on about? If you say there will you don't know what you're talking about, you might just be a broken clock reasoning in reverse. Neither one of us really knows what'll happen over a particular time horizon, and you're not really making a case for it otherItâ€™s market cap when from a few hundred billion to almost 2 trillion quickly.Yeah, and?The chart of this stock goes straight up.A stock that only goes straight up on the chart isn't one that's had crashes, which is what your whole point was about.You gonna buy at these levels? Go for it. Good luckWhen did I say that? You're imagining an argument that never happened. If you want to pretend it did in the hopes of making it so, go for it, but no amount of luck will make it real.Long term it will probably do ok but not alot of money to be made on this one. If it double from here do the math of the companies valuationThat's what they said about Apple at $1T. 5 years and it tripled. MSFT has gone up about 400% to >$3T in 6 years. Basically, your argument is ""big numbers are scary"". $1T to $2T isn't any different than $100B to $200B, the company you're talking about is what matters. Meta increased its market cap $200B in a day. 20 years ago that would be more than all but the largest market caps in the world. Different times. Dollar amounts still don't mean anything, it's percentages.Now, you may be right. Maybe NVDA has peaked or will soon. Again, didn't make an argument about it since it was really neither here nor there, the discussion about what had happened which you were only kind of right about. As far as NVDA's future, I'll say as someone up on the stock about 520% I'm a little shaky as to where it'll go. But your argument isn't very compelling.",5,0.549,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"Ive gotta gently push back on your criticism of the big numbers are scary criticism. Using your example of MSFT running 400% in 6 years to 3T, how reasonable is it that MSFT can continue that? Is it in the range of probabilities that MSFT trades at a 48T market cap in 12 years? GDP better pick up quite a bit in the meantime.Im just saying big numbers ARE scary and its a hell of a lot easier to go from 3 million market cap to 100 million than it is to go from 3 trillion to 100 trillion.",6,0.539,0.999,NEGATIVE

,,That was back when everyone was buying Nvidia cards to mine Ethereum and even they said that this kind of growth is unsustainable. The stock fell once Proof-of-Stake was introduced.,3,0.587,1.0,NEGATIVE
,,"Why it may be justified:Jensen is now meeting with state-level/sovereign customers for massive compute deals. Saudi Arabia, Japan, India.It may be a state-level imperative for many countries to have large-scale AI compute infra. So going forward, it may become a new normal that parts of national budgets get regularly pumped directly into NVIDIA coffers.NVIDIA is now eating up the custom chip market. Not for training, but for inference. Many companies were going to build their own or vendors competing are either going to buy more NVIDIA or get wiped out by NVIDIA.",0,0.548,0.989,NEGATIVE
