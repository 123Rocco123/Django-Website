,"I believe most of people will be using some kind of Augmented/ Virtual Reality device in the next 20 - 30 years, just like all of us use smartphones today.

Samsung to make the hardware, Google to make the software.Which is good thing because I think Google has laid off their VR/MR/XR hardware teams twice in the last decade.MSFT has Hololens, but they had a huge layoff last year in that division. They do have a contract with the US military for Hololens so I suspect that's strictly an enterprise product now. They also had WIndows Mixed Reality, but they announced that it is being sunset and will shutdown in 2026.",2,0.543,0.998,NEGATIVE
