,"Broadcom (AVGO) is an excellent opportunity to ride the AI future outside of Nvidia and GPU's. Broadcom #AVGO has a $11Bn annual AI run rate from datacenter ASICs/TPU's and datacenter networking. It is unique in its aggregation of firms - it has a high-value semiconductor business and a sticky SaaS business, with recurring, and sustainable higher quality software revenues from the VMware acquisition. There is a tremendous amount of operating efficiency in their business. Broadcom has been a great performer in the last 10 years with revenue, operating income and EPS CAGR's of 27%, 38% and 32% respectively. My average cost is in the mid $1,500's, it's gone up to $1,700+ but I'll add on declines if it comes down.",ChatGPT ahh post,0,0.508,0.999,NEGATIVE

So this post is probably AI generated from his written article as the AppLovin post was clearly pulled from the Seeking Alpha article. Not sure why he doesn't post the links to his better written articles.,1,0.519,1.0,NEGATIVE
