I think that's explained by it was originally issued at a much higher than fair price to maximize capital, lots of stocks especially small do it like that. *And* they also had shrinking income -> negative going into that stretch down you're talking about. My guess is they bought new farms -> higher expenses -> income goes down with stock price -> revenues finally catch up -> back to the upside.I both own the stock and buy the eggs they sell.

Could they become a $10T company? $20T? $30T? Who the heck knows.Amazon has been a slow mover since the pandemic and sells off everytime it’s about to make a run. I think Jassy will finally pivot to profitability but the days of 50%+ growth are behind us. Also Trump winning will cause this stock to randomly sell off over the next 4 years as he berates Bezos in public and works behind the scenes to screw Amazon over. He interfered on the Pentagon cloud procurement process which cost AWS a $10b contract. He’ll also come at their retail business and keep the antitrust suit going.Google is definitely undervalued but antitrust and perceptions of complacency and other AI companies taking share from them will keep it weighed down.
