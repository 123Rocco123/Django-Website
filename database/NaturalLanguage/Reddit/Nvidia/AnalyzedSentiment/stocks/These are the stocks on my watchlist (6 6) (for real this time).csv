," Hi! I am an ex-prop trader that trades equities. This is a daily watchlist for trading. I might trade all of the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that don't appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). If you’re on old reddit, click “show images” at the top to see all the charts quickly. I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell. Many stocks I post are <$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade. If you have questions to ask, PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like “Thoughts on _____? will be ignored unless you add detail to the question. News: U.S. Clears Way for Antitrust Inquiries of Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI NVAX- Company said it would be able to deliver a regulator-recommended vaccine against a strain of COVID-19 by September. NVDA- Watching the 1250 level. Might move down today on news of antitrust inquires from the Justice Dept. and FTC. LULU- Company raises full-year earnings guidance, $2.54 vs $2.38 EPS. Also authorized a $1B stock buyback. GME- Interested in the $33 level today. Still short calls, will likely hedge if we get up higher and break that level.

Last update before this showed his position around $30,000,000. Obviously he did so some trading of the stock inbetween then and now but he's never publicly disclosed any trades he has made during that time frame. Just ask yourself, if RK was in this to make a dime and didn't care about anything else then why hasn't he sold? He could literally make tens of millions with his balance just by putting into a savings account. I have no fear whatsoever about RK dumping on anyone except the idiots who are short GME",3,0.525,1.0,NEGATIVE
