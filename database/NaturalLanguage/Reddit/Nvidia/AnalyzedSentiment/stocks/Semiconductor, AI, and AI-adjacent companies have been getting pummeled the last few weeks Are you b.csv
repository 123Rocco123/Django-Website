X company is doing good products, so it s a good investiment. but stock markets have so many variables, geopolitical, economical, macro economics etc. obviously good companies have better luck to outperform, but the question should be, the price currently priced is overpriced or not ? will the company achieve its revenue target ? it's only mathematics you can't control at the end of the day, not only rational thinking. once i start thinking like this, i stop stressing and looking at green or red. it doesn't matter, what matter is if you planify well how much you r investing, why u r doing it, what u expect from it. if u expect quick gains, ie outperforming the market, good luck, many people also wish to have a crystal ball. investment is not a job with a contract, nothing is promised, since you are yourself making a bet at the $ dollar invested. i didn't like VT and chill posts, but now i understand them. i'm thinking going 50% vt 10% vgt and 40% schd",4,0.548,0.995,NEGATIVE

(China knows they won't capture tsmc factories, as Taiwan would rather bomb their own factories and ship out their machines under US escort than giving them to China)The question for people who are interested in TSMC on the long run is if they also view the Chinese threat to be overblown.TSMC without geopolitical controversies is one of the AI companies with fewest risks.

I think we might be nearing a sustained wave of liquidation as the market realizes more growth is priced in than is justified by the current macro outlook. Really wouldn’t be surprised if 30% or more melts off the Nasdaq over the next 12 months. I’m also of the belief that it’s gonna take a year or two for early adopters to demonstrate significant value creation before the next wave of AI investment really takes off. I think hardware investment will level off in the short term, and that services have yet to take off (at least in terms of profitability), so not much upside potential in the immediate term.
