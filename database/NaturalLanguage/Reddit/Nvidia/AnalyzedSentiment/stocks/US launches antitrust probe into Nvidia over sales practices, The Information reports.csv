,"Aug 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice has launched an investigation into Nvidia (NVDA.O) after complaints from competitors that it may have abused its market dominance in selling chips that power artificial intelligence, The Information reported on Thursday. Shares of the company fell around 3.6% in premarket trading on Friday. DOJ investigators are looking at whether Nvidia pressured cloud providers to buy multiple products, the report said, citing people involved in the discussions. The investigation is also looking into whether Nvidia charges its customers more for networking gear if they want to buy AI chips from rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) and Intel (INTC.O), it added. Nvidia commands roughly 80% of the AI chip market. The company did not comment on the report, but said that it would provide any information that regulators require.

Someone actually think Nvidia needs to get ppl to buy their AI chips? I'm not gonna bother googling it but their earnings report might've had a comment from their CEO talking about being sold out for years.
