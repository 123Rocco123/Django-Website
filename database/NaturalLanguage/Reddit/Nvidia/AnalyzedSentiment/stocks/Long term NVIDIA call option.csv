Your Dec 2026 call options would need Nvidia to go up by over 30%. Which is not going to happen, you're never going to sustain off trading the trend, you're not the first person to think about this, all the options are already priced in, you are going to be paying a ridiculous amount for premiums betting that it will somehow gain trillions of dollars. Your break even point is so high that any slight dip like it's had a few days ago will instantly tank your entire life savings Everyone wants to blindly believe it will go up forever and ever because they want to get rich quick when it is going to drop, you're not predicting something 2 years ahead, no one is, especially if you put ALL of your money on ONE trade. If you want long term growth for your life savings invest in a diversified portfolio and index funds. There is a lot more to the market than one single stock.
