,"Alright folks, mega caps and AI are all the rave but there's plenty of rather unknown companies which are growing their earning's at a tremendous rate. My portfolio in 2022 was Costco, Nvidia, Apple, Google and MSFT. They all did beautifully but they're too big for my liking now. Here's the speculative crap I'm investing in now 1. GigaCloud Technology - Is like an Amazon or Alibaba but removes the consumer and does B2B ecommerce, no debt, strong cash flow, P/E ratio still reasonable for massive YoY growth. Already up a lot on this company and earning's coming up Q4 which expecting big beat. 2. Vita-Coco - Everyone's all about Celsius or Monster, Coconut Water imo is the next best thing with a growing market, COCO, is the market leader. Summer's here, coming off winter lows and just had big beat in Q4 which normally worst quarter when its cold. Summer they partner with alcoholic brands and all the weight loss craze leads me to believe ppl are choosing healthy drink alternatives. 3. Braze - Companies need a way to stay in touch with their customers, Braze creates a subscription model which handles all types of communication with customers and automates the process. This company is working its way towards becoming profitable. I was watching YT channel who interviews entrepreneurs, saw freelancer making $150k+ a year using the software to help companies so to me that's huge to see in the real world without even having looked for the company. 4. Draft Kings - California and Texas still have not legalized online gambling which those two states alone are absolutely massive. Texas won't vote on it again until 2025, casino's in Oklahoma donate to Texan politicians to help influence keeping gambling out of the state but 2025 imo we see big changes. There's a huge catalyst here and earning's are growing with combat sports massively growing. 5. Sofi - The numbers don't lie. When rate cuts were plausibly announced we saw a massive jump. This company wants to run when rate cuts come but until then ppl really weary even though the numbers and guidance are phenomenal. 6. Palantir - S&P500 inclusion didn't come after 5 quarters now of GAAP profitability, so in June imo we'll see it happen which is a huge catalyst. The earning's are growing as a we all know. I don't like the P/E ratio but this is a company I'd buy and immediately sell CC's on and keep selling CC""s until reaching my assigned price and repeating while holding long term. Everyone of these companies imo has strong growing earning's, relatively unknown still compared to what everyone's piling into, and most have major catalysts coming up. COCO has summer, DK has legalization of massive states, Sofi has pending rate cuts, Palantir has sp500 inclusion, at least Braze and Giga about to report and beat as they do Q4 which should act as minor catalysts imo.","Enjoyed your short write up, I have a position in SOFI already and agree with. GigaCloud however has already run up 700% over the year and still looks reasonably priced. What has caused this explosion in growth?",0,0.553,POSITIVE,0.803

My portfolio in 2022 was Costco, Nvidia, Apple, Google and MSFT. They all did beautifully but they're too big for my liking now. Here's the speculative crap I'm investing in now 1. GigaCloud Technology - Is like an Amazon or Alibaba but removes the consumer and does B2B ecommerce, no debt, strong cash flow, P/E ratio still reasonable for massive YoY growth. Already up a lot on this company and earning's coming up Q4 which expecting big beat. 2. Vita-Coco - Everyone's all about Celsius or Monster, Coconut Water imo is the next best thing with a growing market, COCO, is the market leader. Summer's here, coming off winter lows and just had big beat in Q4 which normally worst quarter when its cold. Summer they partner with alcoholic brands and all the weight loss craze leads me to believe ppl are choosing healthy drink alternatives. 3.

This company is working its way towards becoming profitable. I was watching YT channel who interviews entrepreneurs, saw freelancer making $150k+ a year using the software to help companies so to me that's huge to see in the real world without even having looked for the company. 4.

Texas won't vote on it again until 2025, casino's in Oklahoma donate to Texan politicians to help influence keeping gambling out of the state but 2025 imo we see big changes. There's a huge catalyst here and earning's are growing with combat sports massively growing. 5. Sofi - The numbers don't lie. When rate cuts were plausibly announced we saw a massive jump. This company wants to run when rate cuts come but until then ppl really weary even though the numbers and guidance are phenomenal. 6.

GigaCloud Technology - Is like an Amazon or Alibaba but removes the consumer and does B2B ecommerce, no debt, strong cash flow, P/E ratio still reasonable for massive YoY growth.

Vita-Coco - Everyone's all about Celsius or Monster, Coconut Water imo is the next best thing with a growing market, COCO, is the market leader. Summer's here, coming off winter lows and just had big beat in Q4 which normally worst quarter when its cold. Summer they partner with alcoholic brands and all the weight loss craze leads me to believe ppl are choosing healthy drink alternatives. 3. Braze - Companies need a way to stay in touch with their customers, Braze creates a subscription model which handles all types of communication with customers and automates the process. This company is working its way towards becoming profitable. I was watching YT channel who interviews entrepreneurs, saw freelancer making $150k+ a year using the software to help companies so to me that's huge to see in the real world without even having looked for the company. 4. Draft Kings - California and Texas still have not legalized online gambling which those two states alone are absolutely massive. Texas won't vote on it again until 2025, casino's in Oklahoma donate to Texan politicians to help influence keeping gambling out of the state but 2025 imo we see big changes. There's a huge catalyst here and earning's are growing with combat sports massively growing. 5. Sofi - The numbers don't lie. When rate cuts were plausibly announced we saw a massive jump. This company wants to run when rate cuts come but until then ppl really weary even though the numbers and guidance are phenomenal. 6. Palantir - S&P500 inclusion didn't come after 5 quarters now of GAAP profitability, so in June imo we'll see it happen which is a huge catalyst. The earning's are growing as a we all know.
