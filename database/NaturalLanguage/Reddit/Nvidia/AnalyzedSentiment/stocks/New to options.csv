,"Hey all, I am new to trading options, have been buying calls for the past week. I am trying to be as conservative as can be, as I am not taking anything out. I am investing 50% of earnings into ETFs and then buying new options with the other 50%. This week I have won 800$. I have not let any go to expiration, and sell out as soon as I hit 50-100% return. So far I have only traded spy,99a, nvidia, rivian, and lucid. I have not lost yet. Though I was down on spy -170 and sold today before expiration for only +14. For those of you that have been doing my this for awhile, is it usually like this? Or are we in an extremely bullish market these past two weeks? Obviously other than the past two days.

Set rules for yourself, try to act logically and according to your rules and dont let your feelings take over.Because your first loss will come, thats 100% sure. Thats the problem with options, as they have an expiration date you could lose - even if your right with a stock long term.

Some may blast me for this but there are some strategies that do carry risk but also hedge your bet at the same time. For example a straddle. You buy both a call and a put with the same strike price usually ATM with the same expiration date. If it goes up you make money on the call and the put expires and vise versa.

Don't think that this is what it's generally like.Investing is unlike a casino in that it's not a zero sum game. There's a bias towards growth, so folks are more likely to win than to lose.Buying options is a zero sum game, and there's a slight bias towards loss for the buyer and gain for the seller. You definitely can make plenty of money buying options if you make the right choices, but a purely long option strategy is akin to gambling and a lot of folks lose their portfolio with it.Your approach of using half of your gains for buying options is smart.

I have been selling cc to collect premium trying to lose less. 50 times I was successful. Today it bounced into red zone. I had to buy it back lost $98 per contract before closing. Last Friday I was selling cc on Tsla after I expected it could not bounce up. That costed me $600/contract. Several contracts were involved in both stocks. Very straight forward trades. It is cost basis which complicates what I can do. To sell cc puts are harder. I only have a 40% success rate. To anticipate certain stocks to go down ahead is harder than you think.

So far I have only traded spy,99a, nvidia, rivian, and lucid. I have not lost yet. Though I was down on spy -170 and sold today before expiration for only +14. For those of you that have been doing my this for awhile, is it usually like this? Or are we in an extremely bullish market these past two weeks? Obviously other than the past two days. Another question I have since I haven't ventured off on puts yet, how exactly do they work? Do I have to buy the contract at the end? Or like calls at l able to sell out for profit? Thanks a lot, sorry if it sounds dumb. I'm new to this",Also ask in r/options,0,0.57,0.953,NEGATIVE
,"Hey all, I am new to trading options, have been buying calls for the past week. I am trying to be as conservative as can be, as I am not taking anything out. I am investing 50% of earnings into ETFs and then buying new options with the other 50%. This week I have won 800$. I have not let any go to expiration, and sell out as soon as I hit 50-100% return.
