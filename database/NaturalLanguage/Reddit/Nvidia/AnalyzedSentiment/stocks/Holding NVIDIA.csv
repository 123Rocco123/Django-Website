Just want to know other people opinions on this,At least 50% of your money should be in equities with maybe 10-20% in solid companies (NVDA fits that)So your 1/6th is fine.Just make sure you’re not risking double exposure (eg DJIA and then investing into those companies directly) putting too much into any singular company.,0,0.549,NEGATIVE,1.0

Just want to know other people opinions on this,Once your stock rolls over a 10% loss it is no longer a 1:1 trade off to get your money back. Losing 10% of value needs 11% to get your money back. Hold all the way to 20% loss and now you need 25%. 30% loss needs over 40% to get back to break Even. Buy and hold is usually not a great idea on individual stocks. Date them. Don’t marry them.,0,0.535,NEGATIVE,0.999
