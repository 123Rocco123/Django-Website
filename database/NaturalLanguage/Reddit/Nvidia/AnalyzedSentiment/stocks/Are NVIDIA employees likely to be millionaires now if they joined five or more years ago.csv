If ""you believed in it"" you could've bought it being in ANY company at all.Instead of NVDA, if you joined a crashing company, selling immediately upon vesting and invest it elsewhere - hell maybe even used that to buy NVDA instead - you would've looked like a genius.At the end of the day, NVDA employee should not be subject to any more regrets than ANY investors who didn't all in and sell a bunch of other stocks to buy into NVDA instead. There's literally no practical difference.Some people also mistake tax implications. You pay INCOME tax regardless how much your RSU has changed from grant to vest, and those becomes post-tax money (stock). Your cost basis of the stocks is at the time of stock vesting, not grant price.

Here are a few things I remember off the top of my head.• ⁠Most people in these positions are experts in their field, super motivated and disciplined, strive to get better and better. So yes, now they're multimillionaires but they're not the type of people to just quit and retire in their 30s or 40s. If they leave, they're likely quitting to start something new or join another start up.• ⁠Most of these tech companies are in expensive ass areas. NVIDIA for example is in the bay area which can fetch a few million dollars for a basic house. Maybe their stock options turned into $5 mil and then they buy a nice house for $4 mil, bought a new car, etc. Seems crazy for the average person in Ohio but I can see them running through it quickly after high taxes in California.• ⁠Lifestyle inflation along with their personal networks. Sure you made $10 million, but that's a small fish in the big pond of silicon valley. Your coworker has $15 million. Your ex coworker at Google has $20 million. Your new neighbor in your multi million dollar neighborhood has $50 million and is your boss. Maybe you could move to Ohio and retire at 35 but if you're in that kind of situation to begin with I'm sure you're just even more motivated to keep working.• ⁠These people also just like their jobs. You're not working at an insurance company making phone calls all day. You're working for THEE fastest growing company and making history. You have a great CEO and their company is built very well where you don't deal with 100 levels of management and if you have any seniority you're only a few levels away from talking/working with the CEO.
