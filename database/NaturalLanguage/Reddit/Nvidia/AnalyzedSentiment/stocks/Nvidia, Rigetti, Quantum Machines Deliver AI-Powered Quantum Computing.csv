,"Nvidia, Rigetti Computing, and Quantum Machines have revolutionized quantum computing by using AI-powered tools like Quantum Elements and Qruise to automate the calibration of quantum systems, addressing the bottleneck in scaling to larger quantum computers. This innovation, demonstrated at the Israeli Quantum Computing Center, integrates Nvidia’s DGX Quantum platform for seamless quantum-classical computing. Other industry leaders, including Google, AWS, Microsoft, and IBM, are also accelerating advancements with AI-driven error correction, faster simulations, and larger qubit systems. With $1.5 billion in venture funding raised in 2024 and governments like the U.S. investing heavily through initiatives such as the National Quantum Initiative Reauthorization Act, the sector is poised for transformative impact across industries, enabling breakthroughs in AI, cryptography, drug discovery, and more. This article underscores the global race in quantum technology and its potential to reshape the future.

Rinse and repeat til I got in this week. I feel I’m a bit late for this party.. hoping it’s just the pre-party and plan to ride it till the after party. Probably just to sell after the party..",1,0.518,NEGATIVE,1.0
