,"Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Tuesday, September the 10th, 2024- Stock futures are flat as September sluggishness continues, traders await inflation data: Live updates Stock futures were mostly flat Tuesday after the major averages rebounded from their worst week in 2024. Futures tied to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures each added about 0.1%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 16 points, or less than 0.1%. Cloud platform company Oracle surged about 8% after posting fiscal first-quarter results that topped expectations. Oracle also announced a partnership with Amazon Web Services to provide database services. On Monday, the three major averages made a sharp comeback after posting their worst week this year as investors bought the dip. The S&P 500 popped 1.16% to snap a four-day run of losses and post its first winning day in September. The Nasdaq Composite also closed 1.16% higher, aided by a jump in Nvidia. The Dow climbed 484 points, or 1.2%. These moves come as investors bet that a widely anticipated interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve’s Sept. 17-18 meeting could help assuage concerns over a weakening economy. August’s payrolls report, which came out last Friday, reflected growth of 142,000, below economists’ expectations. The results helped fuel a sell-off that day. Traders have their eyes on two key economic reports that will likely be the next catalysts for stocks. The consumer price index report for August is due out Wednesday, followed by the producer price index on Thursday. September is historically a weak month for equities. Investors remain cautious about seasonality’s effect on stock performance as well as uncertainty around the approaching U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5. “We concur with the view that the market is likely to remain choppy at least until the election,” Bank of America equity and quantitative strategist Ohsung Kwon wrote Monday. “Macro data have been weakening, especially in manufacturing/goods, which represent 50% of earnings for the S&P 500.” STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: (CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!)

I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Tuesday, September 10th, 2024! :)","How to cheat the market of 20 trillion?Over two years (1H24 to 1H22), net income of US public non-financial companies declined by 1.5% at par and fell by 7.9% on an inflation-adjusted basis.Meanwhile, moderate stagnation with a downward trajectory was driven by the strong performance of technology companies, i.e. excluding technology and trading (Amazon factor), profits collapsed 18% at par and 23.3% when adjusted for inflation.At the same time, the US market was balancing in the 3600-3800 range with a break to 3500 points (1H22 reports were known, as they are now for 1H24).Profits were down by a quarter in real terms with no successful reps in tech, and this was presented as a 20 trillion dollar success (the difference in capitalization now and then).Mental distortions, AI hallucinations, pure idiocy, baybucks and highly concentrated insanity are the ingredients of a 20 trillion success and nothing more. Someone dreamed that they started growing at the economic boom rate of the 90s, when in reality it’s stagnation with a downward slope on a high base.This is no longer in the field of economics, it is pure psychiatry and social engineering. The results in 2024 are worse than 2022, and the elation is as if one has teleported to an alternate universe of magical dreams, a fairy tale utopia AI world and incredible cash flows that don’t exist.Is it true that technology is showing an increase in profits? Yes, it’s true. A historic high in absolutes and high growth rates, yet everyone else is in severe decline by their own calculations based on company reports:Trading: +10.7% y/y and +43.5% for 2Q24, and for 1H24 +11.6% y/y and +44.2% for two years (further in the sequence shown).Medical: +38.9% and -22.2% / -19.5% and -44.9% (!)Consumer Discretionary: -23.6% and -2.1% due to Warner Bros. 10 bln loss / -8.7% and +0.7%.Industrials: +4.4% and +4.7% / -9.3% and +10.3%.Commodities and utilities: -13% and -52.1% / -21.1% and -33.9% (!)Transportation and communications: +37.5% and +0.1% / +10% and -5.8%.Technology: +22.8% and +38.9% / +30.7% and +24%.These data, please note, are at par! If we compare 1H24 to 1H22, three sectors are in the negative (medical, raw materials and transportation, communications), two are in the zero (consumer discretionary and industrials) and only two sectors are in the plus (technology and trade due to Amazon).There are literally 10 tech companies in good profit, everyone else is very bad. But everyone else is on the hai (look it up).",0,0.534,NEGATIVE,1.0
