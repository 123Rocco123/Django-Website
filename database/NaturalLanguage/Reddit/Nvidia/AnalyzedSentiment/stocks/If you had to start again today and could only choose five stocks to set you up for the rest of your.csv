The United States can't allow TSM, and just Taiwan in general to go down for several reasonsWorldwide manufacturing in the tech sector relies on Taiwanese advancements. Taiwan absolutely dominates the American tech sector and is a top 10 US trading partner.If China overtook Taiwan, they would instantly be the world's foremost semiconductor manufacturer. That would not bode well for the US, because it creates a forced purchasing situation as well as threatening our tech industry if purchasing is impossible.Our agreement to defend Taiwan predates the semiconductor industry. They are a strategic ally and base in East Asia.Overall, a war with Taiwan means a war with the US, and China is aware of this. They've been barking about invasion for decades. Taiwan has the means to defend itself, and friends to help. And besides, TSM has a kill switch on their research that funnels to the US.And even if somehow China did overtake Taiwan...TSM would live on, in my opinion. There would be no reason for them to not just take over the entire company. After a while, the world would accept that the invasion was a success, sanctions or whatever else would be lifted, and China would resume manufacturing under TSM.Simple, yolo it.",4,0.531,NEGATIVE,0.951
