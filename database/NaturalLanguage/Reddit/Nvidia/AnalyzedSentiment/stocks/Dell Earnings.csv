What I said was that Dell's DC infrastructure numbers were up 34%, which indicates that they did well with data center business. People saw it drop after hours and immediately went to ""It's MUST be losing business to SMCI"" which is a wild assumption given Dell has different divisions, so while they did poor in the PC section, they increased their revenue in DC business.You are going on a tangent about something totally different instead of comprehending what I originally wrote. I wasn't talking about SMCI's financials. I was talking about Dell's increase in DC revenue, which does not mean that they are losing business to SMCI. My numbers are numbers related to ER, not accounting. And just because you deal in the legal field, it doesn't mean I also do/have not, so making assumptions....I have done very well with investing.
