,"Advanced Micro Devices on Monday said it plans to acquire server maker ZT Systems for $4.9 billion as the company seeks to expand its portfolio of artificial intelligence chips and hardware and battle Nvidia. AMD plans to pay for 75% of the ZT Systems acquisition with cash and the remainder in stock. The company had $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments as of the second quarter. The computing requirements for AI have dictated that tech companies string together thousands of chips in clusters to achieve the necessary amount of data crunching horsepower. Stringing together the vast numbers of chips has meant the makeup of whole server systems has become increasingly important, which is why AMD is acquiring ZT Systems. “AI systems are our number one strategic priority,” AMD CEO Lisa Su said in an interview with Reuters. The addition of ZT Systems engineers will allow AMD to more quickly test and roll out its latest AI graphics processing units (GPUs) at the scale cloud computing giants such as Microsoft require, Su said. “The main way (ZT Systems) is additive to the company is we sell more GPUs,” Su said. AMD plans to break off its server manufacturing business and sell it once the deal closes, as it has no plans to compete with companies such as Super Micro Computer, Su said. AMD has not yet held talks with potential buyers. ZT Systems Chief Executive Frank Zhang will join AMD and report to AMD’s data center chief, Forrest Norrod. The closely held ZT Systems has roughly 2,500 employees of which AMD plans to retain about 1,000 engineers. Currently, ZT Systems generates annual revenue of roughly $10 billion, Su said. Executives expect the deal to close in the first half of 2025 and expect an additional 12 to 18 months to sell the manufacturing business. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at the company’s developer conference in March that the one-time chip designer now creates and sells entire data centers, or the individual components needed to build one. This year analysts expect the company to generate $105.9 billion from its data center segment, which includes chips and other AI hardware. Su said last month the company expects to collect roughly $4.5 billion worth of AI chip revenue this year. The company’s customers include Microsoft and Meta Platforms. AMD expects ZT Systems to contribute to the company’s adjusted financial performance by the end of 2025.

,"Advanced Micro Devices on Monday said it plans to acquire server maker ZT Systems for $4.9 billion as the company seeks to expand its portfolio of artificial intelligence chips and hardware and battle Nvidia. AMD plans to pay for 75% of the ZT Systems acquisition with cash and the remainder in stock. The company had $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments as of the second quarter. The computing requirements for AI have dictated that tech companies string together thousands of chips in clusters to achieve the necessary amount of data crunching horsepower. Stringing together the vast numbers of chips has meant the makeup of whole server systems has become increasingly important, which is why AMD is acquiring ZT Systems. “AI systems are our number one strategic priority,” AMD CEO Lisa Su said in an interview with Reuters.

I train AI models for a living and have yet to see lots of Virtual Machine offerings with AMD CPUs with NVIDIA GPUs. Even the weakest K80 and T4 GPUs, I havent seen any AMD CPU being paired with it on both AWS, Azure, GCP, and other cloud platform providers or SaaS. Top platforms such as Modal and Bento do not provide such offerings. Maybe in PCs. I use Ryzen + RTX for local development. I believe in AMD in CPUs thats why I want them to win the CPU race.Benchmarks mean nothing if they dont get adopted by developers, frameworks, SaaS, companies, etc. I will start shifting my view when I attend a conference or see research papers that use AMD as their machine for training. Right now, Pytorch and Tensorflow have shit integration with RocM and most pruning and sparsification techniques are tied to NVIDIA GPUs",2,0.547,NEGATIVE,0.99

Eric Schmidt recently spitballed its $300b. So even if AMD does not grow its share, it’s still looking at $18b-$24b annual GPU revenue. My estimates are probably off but you get the point. Now imagine how the numbers look even better if AMD can gain a few extra points of share. 10% of share gets them to more than double their current revenues and at a fatter margin (55%).",1,0.552,NEGATIVE,0.996
