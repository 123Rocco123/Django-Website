Google only bought some (relative to Google's size, it's a trivial amount) mostly for Cloud purposes (to gain customers) and to have its stock price move up in the short term.That said, Google/Amazon/Meta/Apple all have their own versions. Some are better for cost (eg: Google TPU) but each of them silos you into its own ecosystems (and both Meta and Apple right now aren't in the market for these services).I would honestly be very worried on the long term standings of this. Google TPUs are very efficient and the bear thesis is basically Alphabet's CEO is incompetent. You can rent Google's TPUs through Google Cloud but who knows if the Alphabet CEO might decide to branch out if there's large enough profit margins in the market. And large tech companies will move in if there's high enough profit margins involved (look what happened with Azure, etc).The real bottleneck is TSMC. All of these chips are supplied by TSMC. I would be more worried if TSMC decides to up the price of production. All of these companies (Nvidia/Google/Apple/Meta/Amazon) are way too dependent on TSMC.And the other issue being TSMC has a limit to how many chips it can produce a year. It needs to be fair to all customers. That's another bottleneck. Honestly, if anything, I would be incredibly bullish on TSMC because it's TSMC that's the most important. TSMC wins regardless of which competition joins because all the competitions get their chips made from TSMC.Really.. the only thing stopping the other major tech companies is that... they are mostly using their own chips for their own use. They haven't been interested selling their chips to other data centers but who knows in the future (these tech giants need to find new ways to make money and when profit margins are that high, it's only a matter of time).Look what happened with Intel chips. If there's lots of money to be made, tech giants will do those in house over time. Let alone the fact that there's already an emulator out there (ZLUDA) to have CUDA on AMD chips. Of course Nvidia 'banned' it and as companies want good relationships with Nvidia right now, companies aren't using the emulator but I highly doubt such ban can ever hold in court as evidenced by Oracle vs Google case.However, at least in the next 2 to 3 years? Nvidia is going to have a great time. The current profit margins gets fuzzier as time horizons go further but that's to be expected.",5,0.542,0.967,NEGATIVE

They only need to supplement their compute. Eventually this will eat into Nvidia’s revenue and profits.Also CUDA isn’t really a moat.

The internet was the future and Cisco made a lot of hardware for getting companies onto the web. Cisco still does. However, the stock trades for less than it did in 2000s on 60 billion in revenue.And it's not like it's because Cisco suffered some traumatic margin decrease or profit issue. On average Cisco has been rocking 25% margins for the whole time. NVIDIA is 30 - 33%. Cisco's revenue is, again, a hair under 60 billion. NVIDIA's is a hair over 60 billion.

There's much, much more to tech than processors. Also don't forget: Intel was the leader in the space for a very long time. After that, AMD. The industry benefits from having competition, as it drives pressure to develop architecture breakthroughs, which benefits computing as a whole, which benefits tech as a whole. But part of that process is watching the industry leaders flip flop over decades.For that reason I've been holding and adding to SMH in my retirement portfolios because I don't know who is going to do what when.

Because a lot of Nvidia's moat is protected by various systems and factors. For starters, the amount of capital, manpower and expertise needed to even equal Nvidia is insanely high. And even then, your profit margins are less than Nvidia and you need to 'prove' yourself in the particulair niche.Then comes the human capital. Anyone can do physical and manual labour, but the amount of people that can work in the semiconductor industry is relatively low and the amount of labours that can give a new company a significant edge over their competitors is even more slim.Then comes the protection of the established brands in the form of patents and are legal obstructions. You see, you cannot work for a competitor because a lot of the personell has to sign non-competition clause, further reducing the labour pool in part 2. If you make a new product you probably need to liscence and patent stuff from the product. If you infrign or even remotely do so, legal battles will be drawn out to sap the competition of resources and other means.The moat in the semi/AI industry is absolutely insane. That is why it's valuations in my opinion are completely justified.",0,0.533,1.0,NEGATIVE
