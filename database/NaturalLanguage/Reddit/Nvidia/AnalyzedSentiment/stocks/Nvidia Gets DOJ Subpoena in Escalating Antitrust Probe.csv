Amd could have continued to develop itZluda emulated the lowest level of cuda. You cannot do that and then take Nvidia binaries apart to reassemble them with that. This is standard licensing terms for software. It's why you can't redistribute anything in c:\windows.Zluda did not emulate the higher level libraries needed for ML and AMD decided not to invest in it. The skills needed to write zluda (a translation layer) are not the same as those needed to write high performance kernels (like Cutlass and cublas). Honestly it's doubtful something like Cutlass could even have the same interface on an AMD chip. They're not designed in the same way as Nvidia. It's not like a cpu.The problem is this. With Intel and AMD, both run the same code. They have the same architecture (x86).Gpus are the opposite. Even Nvidia gpus of different generations might have completely different isas. There is little shared optimization. Optimizations are specific to the card. Nothing in nvidias stack is going to magically enable amd.

The first probe focuses on accusations of pushing customers to buy Nvidia products exclusively and potentially punishing those who have purchased products from competitors. The Department of Justice will also investigate Nvidia‚Äôs decision to charge higher prices to customers who also want to buy AI chips from rival companies.The second investigation has to do with Nvidia‚Äôs acquisition of Israeli startup Run:ai. Nvidia purchased the AI workload orchestration company for $700 million in April 2024. Run:ai develops software that optimizes GPU usage by allowing multiple AI applications to run on the same GPU. This reduces the number of GPUs needed for AI projects, greatly reducing initial cost.The Department of Justice‚Äôs investigation is concerned that the acquisition would further entrench Nvidia‚Äôs dominant position and would bring about antitrust allegations. More specifically, the Department is investigating whether Nvidia acquired Run:ai to suppress a technology that could decrease demand for its GPUs.",0,0.564,NEGATIVE,0.998
