This seems bad for Nvidia in multiple ways. Beijing has previously expressed desire to urgently switch away from NVDA chips and invest locally. Obviously that's easier said than done, but with China being such a huge market for NVDA, increased tensions over tariffs could push this mandate further.

There is zero chance China is going to attack Taiwan.The reason being is the US is completely dependent on Taiwan and they would never stand for it.If China attacked it would be over for China. They are just way too dependent on the West.Yes the West is also dependent on China but it is far worse for China than it is for the West.Trump does not change this equation. Trump cares about money and the market and both would be in bad shape if the US did not counter anything that China did.Plus China is going to be far less to start sh*t with Trump because he is so unpredictable.,0,0.528,NEGATIVE,1.0
