,"Hi everyone, looking for some advice. I recently purchased some shares of Micron with a trade price of about ~$139 (when I thought it was the dip lol), and I'm currently down about 30%. I'm planning to hold long term and am wondering what I should do. Should I buy more micron shares and average down or diversify and buy different stocks like Nvidia, Microsoft, etc.?","$MU bagholder here. I plan to buy more. $MU is a key player in supporting an AI-based environment, including manufacturing semiconductors used in Nvidia's chips. They'll be back up.",0,0.552,0.997,POSITIVE

Should I buy more micron shares and average down or diversify and buy different stocks like Nvidia, Microsoft, etc.?","I'm in the same boat, average price of $135 after selling puts that got assigned. I bought other stocks like NVDA and will watch MU. I will hold since I think MU was crushed by macro factors more so than company performance. Performance-wise, I think investors were expecting something beyond what was realistic, earnings were good. Now that price came down so much, earning expectation ""misses"" will be less punitive. I think there may be more room to move down from a macro point of view, so I personally will not average down just yet. I will also attempt to improve my cost basis through options.",0,0.546,0.688,NEGATIVE
