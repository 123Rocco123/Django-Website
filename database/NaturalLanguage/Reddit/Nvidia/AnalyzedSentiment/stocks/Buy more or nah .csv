,"So I bought 2 Costco share and 3 nvidia shares on Friday. I know it's not a lot. I'm wondering if keeping costco share is smart move or should I sell it and use that to buy more nvidia ??

Also I'm new to trading , started investing 3 weeks ago and I've invested 10k in several companies","Avoid FOMO decisions if you can.Also, try to read about the difference between trading and investing. You‚Äôre talking about investing in these stocks for growth in the next 6 to 10 years, yet you‚Äôre talking about selling your COST shares days after buying. Why are you even thinking about selling? Why did you buy in the first place? Why change your mind now?Your post is confusing in many ways, which is why I suggested the above.Generally, look at WHY you‚Äôre thinking of selling.What was your reason for buying in the first place? Your reasons are important.What has changed since then?If you still believe your original thesis for buying the stock in the first place holds true, then why would you sell?You‚Äôre wondering if keeping COST is a smart move, which means you somewhat care about what the smart move is.Smart for what? Trading or investing?If you‚Äôre trading, you need to really be keeping track of, and minimizing, how much you‚Äôre selling, given the tax implications.If you‚Äôre investing, then buying, & holding (never selling) is the smart move. In this case, panic-selling is as bad of a decision as it can get.If you‚Äôre investing in a company long term, then treat it like any other multi-year commitment.The way I see it, if you can‚Äôt stomach seeing your investment be down 25% for a few months, then you definitely don‚Äôt deserve to be there when it‚Äôs up 200% at a much later date.Of course, people‚Äôs risk tolerance will vary, and it‚Äôs important to maintain your boundaries, so have a stop-loss strategy that suits you.Just know that, at least most of that time, trading and making decisions based on fear will often lead you to buy high and sell low. You‚Äôd be surprised how many people need a reminder that you don‚Äôt wanna be buying high and selling low (in general). So if a particular investment is low at any given moment, are you thinking of selling because of your investment/trading strategy, or are you just scared?In general: If you can‚Äôt explain, or don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre doing something, then it‚Äôs probably not a smart move to put your money on it.",0,0.53,0.999,NEGATIVE
