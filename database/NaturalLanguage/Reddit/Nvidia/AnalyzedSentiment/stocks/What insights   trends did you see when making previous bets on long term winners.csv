The day he stepped down and Satya Nadella took over, I bet hard on MSFT figuring that if a clown like Ballmer could keep that ship afloat, a smart guy like Nadella could take it to the moon.

While I don't pay for anything on it, I know plenty of other parents who willingly allow their kids to buy the in game currency to buy a whole load of random stuff related to the game.I remember when Facebook or Meta tanked hard a couple of years ago because investors were concerned about the sheer amount they were and still are spending in their version of a metaverse. But when I saw my kid and many others spending time and money on this stuff, it appears to me that Meta is building a foundation for their future revenue and along with their already solid fundamentals, I took a punt and bought a fair amount at an average of 114 and have just sat back and watched it surge over the years.Have I managed to replicate this success with other businesses?

My average is right around $26 so I have a lot of buffer. Holding it for the long term with the expectation that the platform will continue to evolve and over time profitability will happen.

On the original topic about ROE, this does looks really attractive. 20% ROE on a company like this seems reasonable for a low market cap company. It looks like the returns are great compared to the size of the company.However, it looks likes it is high growth and very cyclical. For example there is periods where there is extreme revenue and then all of a sudden it drops fast from one Qtr to the next.This is where I would be a bit curious. The RoE seems to spike when the revenue pops, but takes a massive hit when the revenue drops. This means they are carrying extremely large fixed costs. I would read from this that they can potentially do more with what they have, which leads me to believe their commercial strategy needs some work.Its not really something I would personally invest in, but if you have the risk appetite for the volatility and can stay the course, I would say its not a bad stock to hold in the portfolio for a moon shot.",4,0.548,NEGATIVE,0.625

I had no intention of trading it again, but when I saw it break into the 25's this year with 10's of billions of cash on hand, I couldn't help myself and loaded up on shares and leaps again.

Helps that I can hit the buy button when I have my FOMO moments and get that sweet sweet dopamine, but limits my downside and gives me some time to actually learn the stock, and very rarely is that actually an entry I should have taken with any size anyway.

Investing in the cannabis market is thus kind of a waste. Rather you should be looking for brands that can sell at a proper margin.I also got some winners though. Tesla just made a lot of sense to me in 2017. EVs made like normal cars rather than trying some fancy stuff. The fact they had the Roadster at the time which was relatively successful meant there was a lot of value to be added there. Tesla had a massive first-movers advantage (thus a lot of value). Combined with the initial vision, which still hasn't been pulled off. Tesla was supposed to be an all-electric solution/replacement. Tesla Solar, Battery and of course cars. The fact they still didn't pull this off whilst competitors have been catching up was reason with a massive valuation was reason for me to divest.Nvidia was a pretty obvious one as well in 2022. First-movers advantage in combination with the hype of ChatGPT and now they can sell their 1-5k cost basis AI cards for like 30-40k. Also the reason why I went into Microsoft at the time with their co-pilot initiative.A few others are simple swing trades. During Covid oil prices sunk to negative prices and Oil companies fell with it. Managed to 3x my investment in Shell at the time with great dividends.Banks in 2020 were also at a massive discount. Was quite clear that interest rates had to be raised at some point resulting in the massive profits banks gained in the past 2 years.*Now I'm a huge Intel simp. Massively undervalued in my opinion and can sink even lower depending on lawsuits for 13th and 14th gen chips. It seems to have a 3x to 10x return in 2 to 5 years. Intel at this value makes sense if they were still massively behind on AMD. On a consumer glance that does seem the case. However, if you look at datacenters their new Sierra Forest is equal on performance with AMD whilst they will still produce improved versions in a few months. Their new 20A and 18A chips will also be a massive improvement introducing technology that TSMC hasn't pulled off yet in backside power delivery. In addition, to using the new ASML machines.The only explanation for their low value is due to declines in revenue and profits. However, if you look at the multiples. Intel has 3x revenue and 2x profit than AMD but is trading at 2-3x lower value.",0,0.536,NEGATIVE,1.0

Current plays are welcome too!","Tesla.Was an admirer of the vehicle and Elon too actually. Loved the mission. In my head even back in 2012-2014 it made sense to not own a gas powered vehicle if an electric vehicle with even 200 miles is available.Then got the experience the model s for the first time from a family member who was an extremely extremely early adopter. Loved it.Been holding shares since then. Wish I never sold some of it like I did in 2018 I think. But regardless definitely my longest individual hold so far.I see some of those same things with rivian too. Don’t think they will ever be as successful as tesla but if the stick 5x from here, I would be super happy.",0,0.513,POSITIVE,1.0

I missed that one, always too worried about valuation but definitely have regrets.What made you sell at the time?What’s keeping you from selling now?",1,0.516,POSITIVE,1.0

Don’t have regrets though because it was insane investing in it back at that time. Anyone that did it was basically rolling dice.I made a lot of profit and doubted my own thesis. I was surrounded by Tesla haters and kept hearing they will go bankrupt any day. Reading Reddit on Tesla made it worse back in those days too. It’s my fault for doubting myself though. Would have been so much more if I had held on. But at least I have a chunk of it from back then still. I feel the same way about rivian when I read on it now. The same Tesla doubters in my friends and family doubt Rivian but I’ll stick with my hypothesis and keep buying every time they go below 14 a share.I think Tesla has massive avenues to increase profits that nobody else does. Their energy storage business is growing at a great rate, and I do believe they will be closest to solve driving autonomy. I had FSD beta for months and have seen it myself. Nothing will ever be perfect just like human drivers now. But it will be great. Also humanoid robots have a lot of potential. It’s all very ambitious as always with Elon.",2,0.522,POSITIVE,0.742

Rivian is an expensive truck with nothing too unique? I’m not too knowledgeable on them but I’m about 10 minutes from their HQ and see them all over.Do you similarly feel like you’re “rolling the dice” with Rivian? Understandably you might be anticipating future growth based off the trends in electric vehicles, Amazon backing and projections for upcoming profitability(?).I’ll have to look into Rivian some more, regardless thanks for the input!",3,0.514,POSITIVE,0.985

Rivian buyers already accepted EVs cuz of Tesla so rivian has a less tough hill to climb in the social aspect at least.You highlighted a lot of the reasons why I like Rivian. But think about it like this, your expensive truck comment could have been said and was said to Tesla as well when only the model s and X were for sale and that’s way before any of this energy, robots, AI stuff. It’s the model 3 and Y that made Tesla work.Rivian is coming with the R2 and the R3. I do think the R2 will blow up and if Rivian can execute on delivery then it will be magnificent for their company. Maybe not to the scale as model 3 or y was for Tesla but even 1/4 of that would be great for the company and stock.The market is big enough for both Tesla and Rivian to succeed. Also Elon has done a fantastic job to drive a decent bit of consumers away from Tesla over the last 4 years and they will go to another EV maker. Rivian will be that EV maker.Elon’s political saga and whether Tesla would really suffer or not can be a whole different post it self. I have talked about it in depth before with other people on here so won’t go into it now. But Tesla will be fine.I love talking about this stuff so thanks for asking!",4,0.539,POSITIVE,0.907

I smell BA can be next target to have more accountability. Johnson and Johnson is a new split. I sold the consumer division at gain kept JNJ. Most gains are unplanned got them early on from actualy research cheap but affordable stocks. These 15 dollars stocks often do quite well when gets noticed with strong earnings.,0,0.538,NEGATIVE,0.628
