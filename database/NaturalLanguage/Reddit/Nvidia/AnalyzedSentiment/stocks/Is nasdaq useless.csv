,If the absolute majority of nasdaq 100’s increase / decrease depends on the top three companies Nvidia Apple and Microsoft.

Look at the top NASDAQ companies from 50 years ago. Then look at them from 25 years ago. Then today. How many remained on the top? Investing into a NASDAQ-100 ETF guarantees you that you will own the top 100 companies today, and it guarantees that you will own the top 100 NASDAQ companies 50 years from now.",0,0.555,0.978,POSITIVE

All I’ll have to do is follow what are the current top 3 companies on Nasdaq-100 and in what positions the current companies I am invested into are placed. That way I maximize profits and at the same time stay on trend. Basically using the index without buying into it,1,0.534,0.871,NEGATIVE

When a stock falls out of the top 10, you hold that stock, but do not buy anymore. You only sell a non-top10 stock to tax-loss harvest, or if the stock falls below the top 25 in the index.I’ve been thinking of trying something like this in my brokerage account but it might be simpler to just hold the index.",3,0.571,0.999,NEGATIVE

Definitely greater risks due to less diversification (you could run into another enron in the future and lose a couple years of profits in a single day), but in return you could get higher returns on the long term. Or not. Maybe smaller companies will overperform the top ones in the next couple of decades, who knows?I personally do not own any ETF-s and make my individual stock-picking myself. I'd say that if you are confident that the top companies will overperform the market, then try to compare the top 3 (yearly changed for example) to NASDAQ-100 historical returns. If it performed good historically, then go for it :)",2,0.533,0.963,POSITIVE
