Good idea or bad idea just very confident it will be good news already up 200 today with nvidia and calls I put on on Monday for the S&P. Any thoughts?,"Maybe buying any calls or puts options are gambling because it's so hard to time the market, and everything seems to be already priced in.I think CPI will show 'shelter costs' to continuing rising too much because of the housing shortage. Also maybe energy and others may show inflation could be starting to look like stagflation. So maybe the stocks market may decline. The financial news has been hyping the rate cuts for too long, so I'd not be surprised if there is a big stock sell off even if inflation and continued delay in rate cuts happens as expected.",0,0.537,1.0,NEGATIVE
