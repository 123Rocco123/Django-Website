It’s amazing how successful fabless chipmakers have become.If Intel was somehow able to leapfrog TSM with better chips and start to take some of that heavy demand then yes, Intel would be a good bet.

For the foundry TSMC, being specialized in semiconductor manufacturing, can reinvest its profits to improve transistor technology.Does that make sense?

Apple and (sometimes) Samsung both make their own chips these days anyway.My thing with AMD and Intel is that they’re both at lower prices than they were BEFORE the AI craze. Their success doesn’t hinge on AI. I don’t see the consumer electronics space disappearing. People are realizing that Nvidia’s heart lays in AI now.
