I bought late in 2023 after their earnings and the stock boomed to $520 (pre split) in the after hours. I bought around $510. The stock proceeded to tank for a month-month and a half, and I stupidly listened to this sub:""Why not let the stock go to 50 trillion, might as well with your logic""""You bought at the top? Lol""""You really believed the stock was worth $500?!""Etc etc. I sold like an idiot around $420 for a loss. If I would've held, I would've been up by about $28,000. But no, I listened to Reddit Stocks.Ignore the comments from people on this sub about:""I knew the top was in because blah blah blah""""It's going to keep going down""""It's overvalued""Etc etc. Look at what the price targets are (ignore Reddit when they tell you price targets don't matter, they're not perfect but they're better than Reddit).Better yet, go look at your own workplaces 401k account. Look at the holdings in your 401k portfolio. Nvidia is now in the top 3 holdings of most retirement plans, including the famously Reddit spammed VOO (because Vanguard is apparently the only brokerage with an S&P500 tracker I guess, and don't say it's the lowest expense ratio because my SWPPX has it beat). Nvidia previously has not been in the top 3 holdings of most retirement portfolios that most Americans are using - It now (recently) is. Big money has shifted towards Nvidia and again, don't take my word for it, go and look at your retirement portfolios.And something to make you feel better - Summer months are traditionally bad for the stock market. It's okay if the stock dips during the next few months. Do not listen to snarky Reddit. Keep holding Nvidia and buying the dip. When your 401k's start shifting money away from Nvidia, then it might be time to think about cutting losses. Until then, hold, buy the dip, and ignore Reddit at all costs. ",0,0.539,1.0,NEGATIVE
