,"Broadcom Surge Highlights the Importance of AI Let’s start with some expert opinions I read over the weekend about Broadcom’s impressive rally views I completely agree with At the hardware level, training costs are skyrocketing, limiting participation to a few CSP (cloud service providers) that can afford it. As economies of scale see diminishing returns, these companies are shifting their strategies toward customer acquisition, commercialization, and retention—similar to Microsoft’s current approach. With growing focus on model deployment and revenue generation, inference is bound to take center stage. Open source models are becoming more valuable, enabling AI application developers to focus on building apps rather than training models from scratch. It’s akin to the role Linux played during the cloud operating system boom. The traditional scaling laws based on data are nearing a bottleneck. We’re likely approaching the end of the pretraining era, with the future pointing towards the ""Agent and Reason"" age. Here’s the key takeaway: Broadcom predicts that by 2027, its three largest existing clients (likely ByteDance, Google, and Meta) will deploy over one million arithmetic card units. Additionally, two more clients are undergoing validation, potentially driving $60–90 billion in AI-related revenue. That said, expectations for overall AI capital expenditure changes remain modest. This shift represents more of a structural change in existing capital allocation. NVIDIA, which currently dominates with over 75% of the arithmetic card market, may see its lead challenged. Broadcom’s ASIC solutions and NVIDIA’s GPUs could eventually share the market. Once AI models stabilize, ASIC—being application-specific—could offer a significant cost advantage over general purpose GPU. For major cloud providers, the massive capital expenditures have sparked criticism from shareholders. At this point, these companies must demonstrate revenue growth to justify the spending. As I write this, AVGO is soaring again. Broadcom rise was anticipated, but the market sentiment is electrifying. Investors are desperately hunting for the next NVDA. After cashing out Tesla last week, I thought Monday might bring a big move for Tesla. Instead, Broadcom stole the spotlight. While Tesla did rise, it couldn’t match Broadcom momentum.

If I wanted to train AI using a state space search on an nvidia GPU, I can, but I can also train an AI using a neural network, probabilistic reasoning, other obscure shit, I can also do that on the same nvidia GPU. Sure you may be able to develop an ASIC to do either, but then what? When your model outgrows that generation of ASIC or needs new training methods or you want to train a different model, then what? Buy more ASICs that do different things?You aren’t mining crypto by hashing the same shit over and over when training AI. You can’t just use an ASIC for any purpose a GPU is used for, and you certainly cannot use an ASIC for calculations as wildly varying as the ones currently used to train AI.",0,0.539,NEGATIVE,1.0

,"Broadcom Surge Highlights the Importance of AI Let’s start with some expert opinions I read over the weekend about Broadcom’s impressive rally views I completely agree with At the hardware level, training costs are skyrocketing, limiting participation to a few CSP (cloud service providers) that can afford it. As economies of scale see diminishing returns, these companies are shifting their strategies toward customer acquisition, commercialization, and retention—similar to Microsoft’s current approach. With growing focus on model deployment and revenue generation, inference is bound to take center stage.

We’re likely approaching the end of the pretraining era, with the future pointing towards the ""Agent and Reason"" age. Here’s the key takeaway: Broadcom predicts that by 2027, its three largest existing clients (likely ByteDance, Google, and Meta) will deploy over one million arithmetic card units. Additionally, two more clients are undergoing validation, potentially driving $60–90 billion in AI-related revenue. That said, expectations for overall AI capital expenditure changes remain modest. This shift represents more of a structural change in existing capital allocation. NVIDIA, which currently dominates with over 75% of the arithmetic card market, may see its lead challenged.

It's rapid advancements in the field that have caused the market to speculate and ASICs are not flexible.
