Intel says the new Gaudi 3 chip is over twice as power-efficient as and can run AI models one-and-a-half times faster than Nvidia's H100 GPU. It also comes in different configurations like a bundle of eight Gaudi 3 chips on one motherboard or a card that can slot into existing systems. Intel said that the new Gaudi 3 chips would be available to customers in the third quarter, and companies including Dell, HP and Supermicro will build systems with the chips. Intel didn't provide a price range for Gaudi 3.

Didn't get in until $32 because I wanted to make sure the recovery was coming, but I'm in nonetheless. Just bought another 100 shares this morning. Many thanks go out to the bears who made this amazing buying opportunity possible. As soon as my wire transfer goes through, I'll buy more. Hopefully that hits my account before the price goes back up.Intel is ridiculously underestimated. The turnaround is still a few years out, but by 2027-2028, I'm betting the stock will 3x. The foundry buildout is going to be a massive revenue stream, and this is just the beginning. By Clearwater Forest, we should have a good idea of how 18A will compete.

Intel says the new Gaudi 3 chip is over twice as power-efficient as and can run AI models one-and-a-half times faster than Nvidia's H100 GPU. It also comes in different configurations like a bundle of eight Gaudi 3 chips on one motherboard or a card that can slot into existing systems. Intel said that the new Gaudi 3 chips would be available to customers in the third quarter, and companies including Dell, HP and Supermicro will build systems with the chips. Intel didn't provide a price range for Gaudi 3. ""We are working with the software ecosystem to build open reference software, as well as building blocks that allow you to stitch together a solution that you need, rather than be forced into buying a solution,"" Sachin Katti, senior vice president of Intel's networking group, said on a call with reporters. Gaudi 3 is built on a five nanometer process, a relatively recent manufacturing technique, suggesting that the company is using an outside foundry to manufacture the chips. In addition to designing Gaudi 3, Intel also plans to manufacture AI chips, potentially for outside companies, at a new Ohio factory expected to open in 2027 or 2028, CEO Patrick Gelsinger told reporters last month.",Buy buy buy? lol,1,0.65,NEGATIVE,0.594

""We are working with the software ecosystem to build open reference software, as well as building blocks that allow you to stitch together a solution that you need, rather than be forced into buying a solution,"" Sachin Katti, senior vice president of Intel's networking group, said on a call with reporters. Gaudi 3 is built on a five nanometer process, a relatively recent manufacturing technique, suggesting that the company is using an outside foundry to manufacture the chips. In addition to designing Gaudi 3, Intel also plans to manufacture AI chips, potentially for outside companies, at a new Ohio factory expected to open in 2027 or 2028, CEO Patrick Gelsinger told reporters last month.",If you read the full article you’d see it launches in Q3 this year,1,0.586,POSITIVE,0.721
