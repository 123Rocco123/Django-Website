Ok great, glad you noticed, that's not an argument people should be using to make investment decisions.Second, no one can predict the future. The risk of individual stocks, especially ones with explosive growth like Nvidia, is knowing when the proverbial music will stop and anyone left standing is out of the game (cute metaphor, but that's the core point).Nvidia is the dominant player in the AI chip space. Period. Full stop. However, it is facing substantial under reported risks. The biggest of which IMO are:Cheaper competitors. Maybe those competitors can't offer as much, but companies may be willing to made that tradeoff.AI isn't making money!!!!!!!! I really want to stress this one. For all the hype around it, AI doesn't seem to be increasing the bottom line of companies enough. Most AI products are fancy POCs, the demos all seem to contain fake content designed to make them more capable than they are, and the actual models themselves loose money being run.Nvidia is priced for perfection. That leaves it vulnerable. It may continue to outperform in the short term though. Good luck.",0,0.534,1.0,NEGATIVE

This stock will be overvalued for many years to come and this is just the beginning of a much larger move to the upside. Thatâ€™s what I think based on what Iâ€™m seeing in NVDAâ€™s data center revenue potential and their capex in AI along with other major players and how they are successfully funding their investments through major layoffs, which will be the new norm in the industry (less engineers, higher efficiency and smaller coding/programming teams).",0,0.542,0.989,NEGATIVE

Here's the tax related answer.You can spread your capital gains over 3 years if that helps you avoid a high tax margin.sell 1/3rd of your shares this yearsell very deep in the money calls for the c remaining shares, 1/2 expiring 2025, 1/2 expiring 2026 (you want them so deep that you are still in the money after a catastrophic fall in price) In 2025, half the remaining shares will be assigned when the calls expire and in 2026, the other half will be assigned completing the tradeThe big negatives of thisyou no longer make any gains when the stock goes up.  All you get is the premium from the calls and it will be small because it is so deep in the moneyyou have lots of money tied up in these shares that perhaps could be better invested elsewhereIt might make sense to spread three captors gains over 2024 and 2025, but to do it all the way to 2026 doesn't make sense because your of the money being tied up",0,0.515,1.0,NEGATIVE

We're probably on the way to something similar to what we saw last year at this point to be honest, I think it tops mid-July and follows it up by dropping 10-12%, but the Composite is going to probably eventually join its not as broad brother over 20k without something interrupting it considering the flows.",0,0.54,1.0,NEGATIVE
