Intel sat around doing nothing but releasing the same tired 4-core CPUs with a 5% generational increase every year.They stopped investing money into the development of their own node shrinks and got stuck on 14nm for way too long while TSMC breezed past, and AMD got their shit together.Now they are playing frantic catch-up.",0,0.577,1.0,NEGATIVE

This in large part kept them afloat back in 2020-2021 when AMD was massively ahead, almost all most laptops were still shipping Intel chips because AMD had to compete for production capacity with Apple/Qualcomm/etc.Of course they fucked up by investing into the wrong tech but having their own fabs is certainl Intel's main advantage.
