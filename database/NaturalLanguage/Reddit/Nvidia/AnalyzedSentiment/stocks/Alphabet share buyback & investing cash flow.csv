,"Alphabet has the best 'value' benchmark among the Magnificent 7 from earning multiple perspective. Accordingly to past financial reports since '22, Alphabet has been dedicating almost 100% of its free cash flow in share buyback. The number is huge considering that its net income in '22 is $60B, $73.8B for '23, and trailing 4 quarters is at $87.7B. Share buyback amounted to $59B, $62B, and most recently $63B. Alphabet uses free cash flow calculation as derived by [Cash flow from operation minus purchases in plants & equipment]. Numbers are compiled at http://gotrader.xyz/ Considering that we're now in the accelerated AI era since the launch of killer app ChatGPT back in late 22, there appears to be no slowing in share buyback. I was curious given the lackluster spending of AI equipment, since protecting Alphabet's moat (i.e., dominant position in search) is more important than share buyback. Take a look at investing cash flow. It's hovering at some $20B annually. One can presume these expenses are inclusive of its custom TPU accelerators (all other major tech companies use Nvidia's). Why don't Alphabet spend more on TPU purchases? What do you think?",They are going to spend $48 billion on AI infrastructure are they not?Which I absolutely love. They are going to have more capacity than anyone. Which is the position you want to be in.They are now the third largest data center chip designer and will take #2 before the end of the year.https://blog.svc.techinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DCC-2405-806_Figure2.png,0,0.553,POSITIVE,0.997

If so then yes it is $48b annualized.From an accounting standpoint, these numbers should be reflected in the investing cash flow section, which at this point is hovering around $20b.We might see some increase in that number, but I guess some of that costs are meant for compensation to technical cloud expertise (i.e., salaries), so the amount spent for actual hardware purchase will be lesser.",1,0.527,NEGATIVE,1.0

Alphabet uses free cash flow calculation as derived by [Cash flow from operation minus purchases in plants & equipment]. Numbers are compiled at http://gotrader.xyz/ Considering that we're now in the accelerated AI era since the launch of killer app ChatGPT back in late 22, there appears to be no slowing in share buyback. I was curious given the lackluster spending of AI equipment, since protecting Alphabet's moat (i.e., dominant position in search) is more important than share buyback. Take a look at investing cash flow. It's hovering at some $20B annually. One can presume these expenses are inclusive of its custom TPU accelerators (all other major tech companies use Nvidia's). Why don't Alphabet spend more on TPU purchases? What do you think?","Do you think they should increase thier stock based compensation plan?Its already eating over 30% of Google's free cash flow. I think its excessive, but you are free to disagree",2,0.562,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Alphabet has the best 'value' benchmark among the Magnificent 7 from earning multiple perspective. Accordingly to past financial reports since '22, Alphabet has been dedicating almost 100% of its free cash flow in share buyback. The number is huge considering that its net income in '22 is $60B, $73.8B for '23, and trailing 4 quarters is at $87.7B. Share buyback amounted to $59B, $62B, and most recently $63B.

Otherwise status quo.You do NOT stop what is working so well.",3,0.549,POSITIVE,0.981
