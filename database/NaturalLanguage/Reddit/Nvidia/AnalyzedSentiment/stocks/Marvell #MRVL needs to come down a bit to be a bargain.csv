,"Marvell Technology (MRVL) $71 Networking infrastructure - It had a down year, with cyclicality in China and slower data center growth. China is about 50% of revenues. That said, the forecast for the next three years is good, with 24% revenue growth and 35 to 40% adjusted earnings growth. A lot of this is riding on growth from Nvidia and other AI investments in data centers. Like most companies in the sector Marvell has also appreciated 73% in the past year so valuations are a bit expensive, 11x sales, with cyclicality and China exposure -- it's definitely on the higher side. It has also financed its acquisitions with debt, carrying a lot of interest burden. I would prefer to buy 10% lower in the low to mid sixties for a better return - there is an AI event on April 11th, which may have more specifics/catalysts. Will keep a look out for that.","It makes sense that a cyclical company is expensive during its trough. Those negatives you mentioned are certainly big risks if the company doesn’t execute well as its business troughs and returns to growth.My view is that the stock has quite a runway for appreciation over the coming couple years since revisions are finally going up. AI revenue hasn’t been pulled forward due to dynamics of the buildout and optical ramping later, so plenty or room for further upward revisions going forward.That’s my view, can you tell I’m long?",0,0.564,POSITIVE,0.92
