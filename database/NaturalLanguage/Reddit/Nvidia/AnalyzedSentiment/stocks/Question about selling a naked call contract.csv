Back in 2022 COIN was around 40-60 $ a share and for whatever reason extremely out of the money calls still had huge premiums. Well, crypto at that time was in the shitter, interest rates that were introduced in late 2021 made most tech companies fall extremely in share price, recession looked likely and the Russia Ukraine conflict made the market fall by a lot. In short the whole market looked like shit, especially the tech market.I looked at it and thought ""under this conditions, there is no way COIN will rally 20-40% in a matter of weeks. No fucking shot"".so I sold calls that were up to 40% out of the money and had only 2-3 weeks till expiration. Again, nooo fucking way COIN would rally 40% or whatever in this market in like 2 weeks.Fast forward a couple of weeks, I'm sitting in a restaurant and pull up my broker and COIN is going through the roof. +20% intra day. My short calls are now in deep red. I'm now several thousand in the red. I start sweating and closed some calls but not all. -12k or something. OK, that's bad but surely COIN won't go up further. I still had like 4 or 6 short calls open that were still like 20% out of the money.A day or so later COIN is up 40% pre market, my broker send me a margin call warning. This was pre open so I couldn't even close my position. COIN climbed to over 110$ a share. I'm in fucking panic mode. My short calls are in the money and I'm -35k on those calls. The market opens and COIN keeps climbing. I managed to close my calls probably minutes before my broker would have margin called me and liquidated my entire account.Turns out COIN announced their partnership with Blackrock and their Spot ETF. That's was the reason the premiums were so high to begin with. Insiders knew thus the premiums for calls looked extremely attractive. had I not closed some calls the day before in the restaurant I would have been margin called and likely would have lost 60k or more.Here is a lesson: if premiums are high and look like a no brainier, it's because the probability of them going in the money is higher than you think. Oherwise the premium wouldn't be that high. There is no free lunch. If the premiums are high, the risk is high.now the part the hurt the most. Had I held on to my calls and had I had enough liquidity to not get margin call warnings, my calls would have expired worthless and I would have made max profit with the naked calls. because COIN went up to 120 only shortly and after a couple of days was back down to 70.",0,0.529,NEGATIVE,1.0

The level of anxiety and cold sweat that I immediately experienced was intense. I remember immediately starting sweating and kind of internally having a mini panic in that restaurant. The best part was receiving an margin call warning while the market was still closed. I could see COIN climb higher and higher by the minute, then I read the news about Blackrock ... I later looked at the margin call warning and calculated that I was above their liquidation threshold. Which means i was able to close my position probably minutes before they tried to liquidate my whole account. I can't remember the exact strike prices I had but it was something around 80-90$. Coin climbed pre market to over 120. So they were extremely in the money. It was a miracle I wasn't liquidated and non of my call buyers exercised the calls.Either way, I lost around 45k in a span of 2 days or something",2,0.515,NEGATIVE,1.0

COIN has tooken me for a ride like no other stock I can recall. My goodness, rollear coaster ride. I used to own like 300+shares at avg cost of like $60/share. I originally started buying at $300/share. During crypto downturn in 2021 I got tired of bag holding and sold at like $40/share to just get out of it. So tired. Little did I see the recovery to have COIN back to $225+ in about 12-18mths or so. I have sold cash secured puts now so have recouped some of the earlier losses.
