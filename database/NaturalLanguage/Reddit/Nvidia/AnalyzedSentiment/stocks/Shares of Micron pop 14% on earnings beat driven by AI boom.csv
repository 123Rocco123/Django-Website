Here‚Äôs how the company did: Earnings per share: 42 cents adjusted vs. 25 cent loss expected by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv. Revenue: $5.82 billion vs. 5.35 billion expected by LSEG. Micron said revenue rose to $5.82 billion from $3.69 billion in the year ago quarter. The company reported a net income of $793 million, up from a net loss of $2.3 billion in the same period last year. For its fiscal third quarter, Micron expects to report revenue of $6.6 billion, above the $6.02 billion expected by analysts. ‚ÄúWe believe Micron is one of the biggest beneficiaries in the semiconductor industry of the multi-year opportunity enabled by AI,‚Äù Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said in a release.

It went on my watchlist when Nancy Pelosi bought it before the last correction and shortly before the CHIPS act was approved. She was down for awhile, but she is ahead if she is still holding. I think MU will be beneficiaries of CHIPS, and will get a bump when that happens.But, I've been trying to figure out who the AI memory winners for the last year, and I think SK Hynix will be producing memory for NVDA's Blackwell beast of a platform. I can't buy them, but can get exposure from the EWY Korean ETF. But, I don't own that ETF now.If Blackwell ships at scale and at spec without major problems or delays by next year, Blackwell should be a major threat to everyone in the AI ecosystem that isn't a part of the NVDA/Blackwell supply chain. Everyone is looking for stocks that are undervalued with secular growth upside, but right now, I'm at a loss about which of those companies are undervalued relative to NVDA, and which of those companies will outperform NVDA over a 5-year horizon.This is a tall order, as you can make five speculative bets, correctly guess one that outperforms NVDA, and still be behind buying-and-holding NVDA. Also, in previous technological transformation cycles, hardware stocks boom first, then software heavy stocks make the real money (IBM vs. Microsoft, Cisco vs. Google, arguably Samsung (made hardware for iPhones and still does) vs. Apple). Jensen Huang knows this and he has apparently been putting NVDA's piles of cash into their own software-as-a-service stack. That means that even if a company is squarely within the Blackwell supply chain, they may not get the margins or added software value of NVDA. OpenAI, anthropic, and perplexity may be future-IPO software winners, but they will likely still be paying NVDA and probably using NVDA software for that right.The caveat is that rollouts never go as planned, and there is a small chance that this year's GTC will be like Elon announcing a 40k uber-range cybertruck, along with fleets of semis using Tesla's supposedly imminent industry-shattering battery efficiencies, all going from point A to B using FSD. Fast forward to today, and Tesla is buying batteries from BYDDY when their cars aren't destined for US markets, and the government has forced a recall that makes autopilot nag you three times as frequently to apply force to the wheel.Jensen Huang has a better track record than Elon Musk at delivering on his promises, but the rollout of new tech (Blackwell) is always bumpy. I don't know that buying MU for ""diversification"" away from NVDA makes sense when it correlates with NVDA, with dramatically less upside, and smaller but comparable pullbacks. Sometimes the market-leading obvious choice, even if expensive on paper, is the best choice. That was certainly the case for previous tech transformation boom, when all of the calls to buy less-obvious stocks were bad calls, and the boring and obvious calls were right as long as you held on tight through some very big crashes.Even I have diversification, but it's with a small tranche of treasuries and much more profitable dividend-yielding bond proxies that will still give dividends when indices collapse, and still give dry powder to buy clear winners when indices do inevitably pull back.",2,0.537,NEGATIVE,0.987

They produce server racks and have a gross profit margin of 15%. They have to buy NVDA stuff to make their stuff. Same for every other server company. Take HPE or DELL, they do the same stuff, are priced much lower, and DELL got even mentioned at the NVDA GTC as NVDA's partner. SMCI is losing the battle here. Insiders are selling there shares and now they even started diluting the stock. Couple years ago SMCI was delisted due to fraud. So I don't know why people would buy into it after a 1500% rally.SMCI is just an overpriced volatile rollercoaster now.",1,0.539,NEGATIVE,0.998
