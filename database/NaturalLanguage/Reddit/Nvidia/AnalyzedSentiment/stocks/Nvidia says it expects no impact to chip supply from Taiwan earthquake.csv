The Chip designs come from ARM, AMD, Apple, Qualcomm and NVIDIA. And the machines that actually make the chips come from ASML. Taiwan, just like China, decided to provide the west with cheap manufacturing. Except Taiwan made the right decision to specialize in semiconductors, since they lack the natural resources to produce large quantities of cheap stuff like China. So because of cheap labor and government subsidies / tax exemptions, basically all western chip companies decided to build their semiconductor infrastructure in Taiwan. The only advantage TSMC has is that building new factories in other countries will cost $ Billions. But because these chips have become so important for national security, the US and EU are moving away from taiwan and increase manufacturing back home. The US even recently passed the $40 billion CHIPS act to become less reliant on Taiwan.",2,0.534,NEGATIVE,0.968

Fabs are expensive wherever you go. All these EUV machines and semiconductor equipments are god damn expensive. TSMC has several advantages over the nearest competitors (Intel and samsung) but cheap fabs in Taiwan is not one of them. The biggest advantage is that Tsmc is pure foundry play which attracts customers trust. IDM has conflict of interest issues, no one wants to fund their own competitors. Secondly, Tsmc technology advantage is considerably massive. Finally, for Taiwanese engineers, working for tsmc is like fighting in a battle field. They know that they are working for a silicon shield for their country. Plus, they are Asians. Thats like Godzilla with wings and light sabre. Yeah, it’s one of the most important companies in the world. If Tsmc stops working, the world will shit their pants. On day 1, god created tsmc before the light.",3,0.521,NEGATIVE,0.975

And after they built the factories they’re not just going to abandon their investments and build a new factory somewhere else, because that would be a waste of hundreds of billions of dollars. That’s why only western companies are in Taiwan, they’re kind of “stuck” there since the beginning, because it costs too much to move. Japan, Korea and China all have domestic plants for example because they all had cheap labor themselves and saw no advantage in outsourcing to Taiwan.Yes that makes TSMC “one of” the most important companies in the world because they are the biggest supplier of advanced microchips. And obviously if something happens to TSMC there would be massive international supply chain issues, but there would still be other manufacturers that would “slowly” fill that void. But if ASML suddenly disappeared the entire world would go back to the 1980’s technologically. Without the machines and maintenance from ASML the entire (high end) semiconductor industry would collapse and we’d be playing Tetris on Casio calculators.
