I think the layman generally doesn't know what AI is, because they just see stuff like ChatGPT/Copilot/Gemini etc., which are just LLMs. ""AI"" is a lot more than that. Self-driving cars are AI, models analysing genomes are AI, image generation, image recognition, text-to-voice, music generation, and so on. I think if it was called what it is, machine learning, the confusion would be a lot smaller.Now, if you said ""LLMs are a big bubble"" that would be more likely. A lot of evidence supports that it's already reached a plateau where it'll largely stay the same for many years now and just see smaller incremental improvements. That said, ""bubble"" is probably still wrong - ChatGPT is absolutely fantastic at coding, for example, and that won't go away, that will continue to stay very useful no matter what.That said, there are obviously companies that are way overhyping it.
