Not just them, but everyone with an opinion trying to claim that they would miss when 1) history says they rarely miss and 2) every IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS company was saying that they are increasing AI spend.Plus, we’re in an AI race. China told its companies to avoid American GPUs and they’re still finding a way to buy them. One thing about races is you can’t afford to change. To use something cheaper all the while converting and building out their API.There’s too much technical debt to build out ROCM etc. Pay $250k a year engineers to hopefully catch up, eventually or just pay for the superior ecosystem. If anyone is going to catch up, it’s going to happen if AI spend is burning way too much with bad ROI.

Companies do stock splits when their share price grows rapidly so usually a great catalyst leads to forward stock split.A reverse stock split has the opposite effect. Usually struggling companies do this as their shares have cratered. Sometimes it’s even done to undo a de-listing warning of price below $1.So forward split tends to be viewed positively.

AI will bring significant productivity gains to nearly every industry and help companies be more cost- and energy-efficient, while expanding revenue opportunities.”Also, his closing line on the concept of tokens:“And so, we should be able to scale out with the NVIDIA architecture for this new era of computing and start this new industrial revolution where we manufacture not just software anymore, but we manufacture artificial intelligence tokens, and we're going to do that at scale.”",0,0.56,POSITIVE,0.981
