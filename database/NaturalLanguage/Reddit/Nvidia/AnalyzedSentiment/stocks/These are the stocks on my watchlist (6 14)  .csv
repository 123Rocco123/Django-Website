Linear increases in model performance require exponential increases in compute power and at some point the economics for GenAI products stop working due to diminishing returns (4o uses a half million GPUs, are they really going to procure 2 million GPUs for GPT 5? 4 million for GPT 6?)The companies I listed have near if not total monopolies on design, manufacture, and key IP of semiconductors. General trends in this market will push them up and down.I expect a correction at some point, especially as (AFAIK) most of the genAI applications aren’t profitable endeavors.My recommendation is to throw it into SOXX if you believe in the premise.
