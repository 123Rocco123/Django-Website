,"So one thing that most people agree on is that Nvidia is the one benefitting from this Gold Rush ( AI Boom) being the most dominant player selling shovels ( GPU's). But my thesis is that this AI Boom isn't sustainable for long since it is not only expensive to afford the infrastructure for machine learning( data centres etc) but also time consuming to train the machines with a googol of information. Now, the problem is that currently there aren't meaningful profitable applications for these AI, especially generative AI which all the companies seem to be hopping on now just for the sake of it. It would make sense if they used this AI to enhance their products which many are but offerring generative AI as a service directly to the consumers still seems to be somewhat precarious. Most common people don't care about AI. The problem that most people are callous about is the over dependence of NVIDIA on this Generative AI Boom to the point where more than 60% of their revenue comes from the data centre/AI segment. Once the AI Boom fizzles out in the future (which I think is still far away), their revenue will take a hit severely and you'll just get a bunch of analysts at wall street filled with gloom just because the revenue doesn't match their expectations. As a result, the stock would take a hit. Remember, NVIDIA might still be incredibly profitable after that and bring in significant revenue especially through their leadership in the gaming segment. However it will lose its former glory and it's stock price would come crashing down. It needs to diversify soon and keep it as its top priority.

The tech bubble did, the real estate bubble did. The fact that this post is heavily downvoted shows you where the public's mind is. Compare that to posts about Nvidia in 2022, where bearish people got a lot of upvotes.With that said, I don't think any person reliably knows when the stock will peak, except maybe Nvidia insiders that have access to non-public financial information.It ultimately just comes down to how much longer Nvidia continues to grow their earnings faster than analyst estimates. And that will come down to how much patience investors have for money-losing AI projects.Right now, there are way too many companies pursuing AI and spending Millions or even Billions on hardware without a clear business plan or even a vague idea of what they want to achieve. That's a recipe for failure.Right now Nvidia looks a lot like Cisco in 1999 or 2000, Selling technology that's driving the future.But 20 years later, Cisco is still cheaper than it was in 2000. A handful of companies like Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Amazon were big winners in the tech/internet boom and their investments eventually paid off, but it took them a while to get there, and countless others failed.I think AI will be the same. Tons of startups folding, larger companies cutting investment in AI, Nvidia's orders face a cyclical decline and the stock could decline as much as 80%. But eventually, 1-2 decades later, their sales will grow a lot from the AI companies that did win, and end up placing large orders to deploy at scale.",1,0.547,NEGATIVE,1.0

It worked during the hey day, then the bubble popped and people decided to look elsewhere. I remember being in Silicon Valley and remember how Sun and Netscape were the things to have. Heck I had a pizza box myself.What happened is that the bubble burst, Linux ate Sun alive and Amazon became the cloud service provider of choice. Essentially nothing what the investors thought would happen did happen. Sun went under, as did Netscape and was bought out for pennies on the dollar by Oracle. I was at the one and only Netscape Developers Conference. I knew from that conference their days were counted. Sun and Netscape were not interested in making money for their clients, they were interested in making money for themselves and breaking Microsoft. Microsoft is still around and I find that completely hilarious.LLM's are not the final stage, they are not even close to the beginning stage. They are a fancy toy just like the Internet was around the dot com bubble. I was part of that bubble and helped people write systems for the Internet.

So no, it won't crash. They still have backorders of massive magnitude, and more companies will be investing, it's just getting going. Every tech company enlisting different copilots and other basic AI things are seeing huge results. Most tech these days needs an element of ""AI"", some form of model training, in order to offer advanced enough features to be competitive beyond older basic functionality, so more and more will be based off of it, requiring more ML, LLM, etc. and the vision side of AI is just getting going.The bigger question is how much upside can there be with how much is getting proced into this meteoric stock price rise, that's practically unbelievable. Question more about competition. But everyone is quite behind, and Tensor/CUDA is so ingrained, it will be a couple of years before anything can really make a dent at all. nVidia was smart and made the software freely available (different than open source), so adoption is massive and no real reason to move off of it, meanwhile it drives enormous hardware sales, which they make crazy profit from, and double dip with crypto miners.If they make a dumb move like try to monetize Tensor/CUDA, that would accelerate folks moving to open-source alternatives, and lead them to purchase more AMD and others, perhaps. However, at crazy hardware and energy costs, or cloud provider costs, efficiency is king, so even 10% speed wins make a different in purchasing decisions. If you spend $5million a year on inference/ML, it's enough to consider change, let alone 20, 30%. Hence why nVidia is killing it due to software in conjunction with the hardware. Nevermind the whole tooling ecosystem, etc.No crashing in site. Any profit taking will barely make a dent, also.",0,0.541,NEGATIVE,1.0

This isn't no investment advice. Edit : The title may be a bit misleading, my apologies. I'm not saying NVIDIA as a company would crash, but its stock price will be severely affected once the AI Boom fizzles out and its revenue reduces , Although I don't think it'll happen in the near future.","Suffering cuz you didnt ""surf The wave"" son?Dont cry",0,0.498,NEGATIVE,0.999
,"So one thing that most people agree on is that Nvidia is the one benefitting from this Gold Rush ( AI Boom) being the most dominant player selling shovels ( GPU's). But my thesis is that this AI Boom isn't sustainable for long since it is not only expensive to afford the infrastructure for machine learning( data centres etc) but also time consuming to train the machines with a googol of information. Now, the problem is that currently there aren't meaningful profitable applications for these AI, especially generative AI which all the companies seem to be hopping on now just for the sake of it. It would make sense if they used this AI to enhance their products which many are but offerring generative AI as a service directly to the consumers still seems to be somewhat precarious. Most common people don't care about AI. The problem that most people are callous about is the over dependence of NVIDIA on this Generative AI Boom to the point where more than 60% of their revenue comes from the data centre/AI segment. Once the AI Boom fizzles out in the future (which I think is still far away), their revenue will take a hit severely and you'll just get a bunch of analysts at wall street filled with gloom just because the revenue doesn't match their expectations. As a result, the stock would take a hit. Remember, NVIDIA might still be incredibly profitable after that and bring in significant revenue especially through their leadership in the gaming segment.
