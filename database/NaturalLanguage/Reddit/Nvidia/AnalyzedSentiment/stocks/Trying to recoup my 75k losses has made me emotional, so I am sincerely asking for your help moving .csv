What % loss was 75k?If you’re still net up, good for you, take that win and learn to manage risk better.You don’t get a 300% gain without loading excessive risk and leverage.If you’re net down, well, leverage swings both ways. Take it as a lesson that easy come means easy go. And it’s likely your 300% performance gain wasn’t replicable so don’t try to do it again or you’ll be deeper in the hole.I’ve met a lot of people who kept borrowing more money or putting more money in doubling down thinking they can make it all back in one shot.

Any winning play like that is gonna come with high risk, and no guarantee.The obvious riskiest one is just buying back everything you sold and pray it goes back up by the end of the year before you pay your capital gains tax (technically you have to pay it every quarter though)The other one is obviously stay away from the 3x leverage, and if you still believe in NVDA, just buy it back with the remaining of your fund.The last play is if you want to mitigate concentration risk, only allocate 10% of your portfolio to stock picking, and the rest to index fund like VTI for diversification. You're not gonna make back the money you lost very quickly, but this will reduce further losses if a big sell-off occurs.You decide what kind of risk you want. after reading that you have a medical condition that will leave you paralyzed in a few years, I'd strongly suggest the last play, and maybe consult with a few family/friends before making big plays. With that kind of mindset, you're gonna lose all of your money sooner or later. You still need money after you're paralyzed by the way, and a few hundred grands is a lot to throw away from impulsive plays.The profits probably came easy for you so you feel less pressure making these risky plays, but just because it came easy doesn't mean you know what you're doing or discovered some magic formula, and with enough sample size, statistics just might reverse all your gains and turn them into loss. For example, leveraging into a stock after it has ran up a lot is a classic mistake because it can easily correct a lot, and those corrections will destroy all your gains since you're leveraged.",2,0.521,1.0,NEGATIVE
