They argued that like Facebook and Uber stayed private for a long time using private investor money to grow their market share, and then when they did go public, they already became large cap companies. I think they were saying the next superstar would be OpenAI if it goes public. Anything can happen, but it was definitely what the article was saying.",1,0.532,NEGATIVE,0.998

Last time I looked at the GME sub reddits they now believe that the genius leadership, just waiting for it to pump, dumping new shares at the peak, using those same retail investors as liquidity, is an overall net positive somehow. And that now that they’ve raised all these funds the company is positioned for a turnaround. If they actually wanted to control a significant portion of the gaming market and turn the company around, they’d have done/be doing what Microsoft did with Xbox game pass. They’d be working on cloud gaming like Xbox already has launched in beta.
