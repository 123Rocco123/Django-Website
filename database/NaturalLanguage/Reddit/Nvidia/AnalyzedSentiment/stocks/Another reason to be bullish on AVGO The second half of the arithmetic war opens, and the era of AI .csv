,"The era of artificial intelligence pre-training may come to an end, and the era of reasoning is on the rise In the future, the demand for arithmetic power will be accelerated from pre-training to the reasoning end, and reasoning is expected to replace training as the main driver of arithmetic power demand in the next stage In addition, with the popularity of large-scale AI models, the demand for reasoning is expanding and diversifying, and the demand for customized chips is also expected to expand AI inference computing demand will grow rapidly and is expected to account for more than 70% of total general-purpose AI computing demand, and inference computing demand may even surpass training computing demand, reaching 4.5 times the latter. NVIDIA GPU currently account for approximately 80% of the inference market, but this share is expected to fall to approximately 50% by 2028 as large technology companies continue to introduce customized ASIC chips AVGO earnings report last week also proved that ASIC demand is strong, and I'm bullish on it for the long term","Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.To everyone commenting: Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.If you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on ""relevant subreddits"" and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
