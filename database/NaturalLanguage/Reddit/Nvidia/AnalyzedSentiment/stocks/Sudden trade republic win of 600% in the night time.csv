,"Hello, i got 2.6k invested 1650 euros in Nvidia and 800 euros in smci and the rest in some smaller stocks. So i got it twice now that my portfolio increased to 17000 euros over night, for over 4 hours until the stock market opened up again and then it quickly fell, once on the 8th june from 2 am to 9 am german time and then on the 10th from 2am till 7am. Does anyone have an explanation why that happened? If interested i can provide screenshots",nvidia did a stock split. all the brokerage firms adjusting the values in different ways. this sort of thing happens with every split. i had some funny numbers with amazon split and with google split a few years ago. it all settled down correctly after a couple of days.,0,0.53,NEGATIVE,1.0
