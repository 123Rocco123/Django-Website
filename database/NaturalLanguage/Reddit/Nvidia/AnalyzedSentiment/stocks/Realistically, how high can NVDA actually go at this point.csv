,"Currently Nvidia has a market cap of 2.62T, making it the 3rd largest market cap company in US. This follows Microsoft at 3.19T and Apple at 2.91T. If Nvidia were to become #1 in market cap, which looks like that's going to happen soon, that would be about 22% increase in its stock price. But beyond that, how realistic is it for this company to keep growing up to 4T market cap and beyond? Are the prospects seriously that good? To hit 4T, Nvidia stock would need to rise by another 50%. I just can't see how that is going to happen. How can Nvidia, which really is just a company that makes GPUs and drives, end up being more valuable than Microsoft, Apple, and Google in the long term? Nvidia has a fantastic business model and ridiculous profit margins, but it still seems unrealistic to me for it's share price to keep growing and growing to a record high market cap at this point. My gut feels like there is far too much hype surrounding Nvidia's prospects and price should drop a fair bit. I think it's too risky to buy in now and that after the stock split we will start seeing a correction. Thoughts? edit: Lol what's with the downvotes? Are we not allowed to have open discussions?","Problem with you thesis is they do have the fundamentals. They have an ARR of over $100b a year. 57% profit margin. And a better PE than Amazon.In Azure and AWS, I still cannot consistently get A100 or H100 VM instances so there is quite a ways to go just to meet todays needs and AI demand is driving compute demands faster than Moores law.Nvidia is also not just focusing on the shovels of AI, they are using their cash to invest back in industry solutions like Pharma, manufacturing, and self driving auto. All of these become new lines of revenue.Personally, I think NVDA would be flat here for a couple months if not for the split next week. I think we see 3T market cap and then a bit of a pull back into the current range.",0,0.549,0.515,POSITIVE

He’s done very well for himself and we never wanted for anything growing up.

Apple and Microsoft depend a lot on “the next big thing” to change the game. If they fall behind or fail to deliver, they can easily be surpassed by other companies. All NVIDIA has to do is keep improving on their current products they already make. They don’t need to revolutionize or invent anything to wow the public. And going forward, all the yet to be revolutionary technology will most likely need a GPU or drive and if they remain the best company for it, they’ve got future business for life and (semi) infinite room to grow their market cap. 4T is definitely obtainable for them. Seems crazy to us now but 20 years ago a 2T market cap on a publicly traded company was also unfathomable.

Not only that they evolved from software box sales to yearly subscription so everyone is forced to upgrade yearly. Nividia is the only company providing something everyone wants. It's competition dropped the ball. But what people truly aren't grasping is the management are brilliant and saw what the future wanted and did it. This is why nivida will be worth 5 t and keep blowing out earnings. After the split everyone will pile in who can't afford it right now. I think share price will run to 200 then settle back at 180. If they fail an earnings report then it will drop and the value will adjust. Those of us who lived without internet and computers understand what true transformation means and if AI retransforms everything then nividia will reach 10t by 2028.,0,0.542,1.0,NEGATIVE
