I sleep so much better at night with VOO and QQQm vs my individual stocks...and they are way less of my entire portfolio.So ultimately it comes down to peace of mind. My advice to everyone is to put 1/4 into individual stocks and DO NOT diversify (aka try to go mostly all in on brands you know) and the 3/4 in a low cost index fund where by nature you'll be heavily diversified.Really comes to my experience of having won+lost picking stocks individually...

The countries that benefit the most from the USA global order, even to this day believe it or not, are China and Russia. Then you have to add the demographic collapse that will occur in places such as Korea, Japan, Germany…Too convoluted for a peon such as myself…The world is going to be in for an extremely rude awakening once we go to the historical normal of having multiple powers having to take care of their own shipping lanes and everything that could possibly entail. Way less stable and unpredictable than now.The positive scenario is the US being able to eliminate their presence (and by nature blow-back) and allow their regional powers to take up the mantle all while working under a common framework. This would still be a net positive for the US.In general I am just extremely bullish on the USA for the coming decades. They still possess a massive competitive advantage across every metric.My biggest issue with the US are it’s debt…and how so much of the capital is coming from central government vs the private sector. In general this could be solved but there are issues for sure.
