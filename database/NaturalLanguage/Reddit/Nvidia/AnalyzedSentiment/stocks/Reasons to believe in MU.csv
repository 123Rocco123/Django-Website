,"As a Micron follower, I've always seen the company as having great potential for growth in the memory and storage solutions space. In particular, its leadership in High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) technology has me excited about its future performance. Here's my analysis and personal view of Micron: Micron is scheduled to report its fiscal first quarter earnings on December 18, 2024, and I believe it is likely to exceed market expectations. Analysts are widely forecasting it to report earnings of $1.77 per share, a quantum leap from the $0.95 per share loss reported in the same period last year. Gross margins were also one of the highlights, growing to 35 percent from a three-year average of 15.8 percent, and are expected to improve further to 39.5 percent in the next quarter. Micron's market opportunity in high-bandwidth memory gives me confidence. From FY2023 to FY2025, this market size is expected to grow 6.25x to $25 billion. With significant growth in HBM3E chip shipments, Micron is expected to realize a significant climb in both revenue and margins in fiscal 2025. Micron's HBM3E chips have a significant advantage in performance and energy efficiency, with an expected 20% improvement in energy efficiency. This is particularly important for data center and AI applications. In particular, the strong demand for memory in the AI market provides great scope for Micron's products. NVIDIA's latest earnings report has proven that there is no slowdown in corporate investment in AI-related devices (such as GPUs), which cannot be supported by Micron's high-performance memory. Currently, 69% of Micron's revenue comes from DRAM products, and I expect that percentage could increase to 70-75% in fiscal 2025. With the double increase in HBM chip shipments and selling prices, Micron's revenue structure will be more optimized, and profitability will be further improved. Micron has demonstrated strong shareholder returns over the past few years, having repurchased $4.4 billion of stock since FY2021. If the HBM market continues to grow strongly, I believe Micron may further increase buybacks in the future. The current 12.8% earnings yield also shows its attractiveness as an investment in the semiconductor space. My Investment View Overall, I am confident in Micron's future. It has demonstrated strong growth potential with its HBM technology leadership and deep integration with the AI market. What's more, the current valuation provides a large margin of safety for investment. I believe Micron's revenue and margins are poised for a significant boost as HBM3E shipments grow significantly in FY2025. Micron's share price is likely to double over the next 12-18 months. In my view, Micron is not only a value play in the AI/semiconductor space, but also has strong growth momentum. Its market position, technological edge and financial performance all make it a worthy long-term holding. Especially in the first half of 2025, if Micron continues to outperform the HBM market, I believe its share price performance will be even more stunning.

Micron has demonstrated strong shareholder returns over the past few years, having repurchased $4.4 billion of stock since FY2021. If the HBM market continues to grow strongly, I believe Micron may further increase buybacks in the future. The current 12.8% earnings yield also shows its attractiveness as an investment in the semiconductor space. My Investment View Overall, I am confident in Micron's future. It has demonstrated strong growth potential with its HBM technology leadership and deep integration with the AI market. What's more, the current valuation provides a large margin of safety for investment. I believe Micron's revenue and margins are poised for a significant boost as HBM3E shipments grow significantly in FY2025. Micron's share price is likely to double over the next 12-18 months. In my view, Micron is not only a value play in the AI/semiconductor space, but also has strong growth momentum. Its market position, technological edge and financial performance all make it a worthy long-term holding. Especially in the first half of 2025, if Micron continues to outperform the HBM market, I believe its share price performance will be even more stunning. My target share price: 157","Just to add, HBM has only 3 manufacturers: SK Hynix, Micro and Samsung. And, the possibility of new competitor is very low due to high capital requirement. This makes the sector pretty safe. Only the temporary risk is the cyclical nature of the sector, which is also currently not that bad considering the stock is not at the peak and HBM demand is still high. Moreover, if you have bought MU at any peak of its cycles, you would still have made more than 50% profit in next 2-3 years.Furthermore, Samsung is still struggling with it's HBM production, which makes Micron much safer option.",0,0.537,NEGATIVE,0.994
,"As a Micron follower, I've always seen the company as having great potential for growth in the memory and storage solutions space. In particular, its leadership in High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) technology has me excited about its future performance. Here's my analysis and personal view of Micron: Micron is scheduled to report its fiscal first quarter earnings on December 18, 2024, and I believe it is likely to exceed market expectations. Analysts are widely forecasting it to report earnings of $1.77 per share, a quantum leap from the $0.95 per share loss reported in the same period last year. Gross margins were also one of the highlights, growing to 35 percent from a three-year average of 15.8 percent, and are expected to improve further to 39.5 percent in the next quarter. Micron's market opportunity in high-bandwidth memory gives me confidence. From FY2023 to FY2025, this market size is expected to grow 6.25x to $25 billion. With significant growth in HBM3E chip shipments, Micron is expected to realize a significant climb in both revenue and margins in fiscal 2025. Micron's HBM3E chips have a significant advantage in performance and energy efficiency, with an expected 20% improvement in energy efficiency. This is particularly important for data center and AI applications. In particular, the strong demand for memory in the AI market provides great scope for Micron's products. NVIDIA's latest earnings report has proven that there is no slowdown in corporate investment in AI-related devices (such as GPUs), which cannot be supported by Micron's high-performance memory.

,"As a Micron follower, I've always seen the company as having great potential for growth in the memory and storage solutions space. In particular, its leadership in High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) technology has me excited about its future performance. Here's my analysis and personal view of Micron: Micron is scheduled to report its fiscal first quarter earnings on December 18, 2024, and I believe it is likely to exceed market expectations. Analysts are widely forecasting it to report earnings of $1.77 per share, a quantum leap from the $0.95 per share loss reported in the same period last year. Gross margins were also one of the highlights, growing to 35 percent from a three-year average of 15.8 percent, and are expected to improve further to 39.5 percent in the next quarter. Micron's market opportunity in high-bandwidth memory gives me confidence. From FY2023 to FY2025, this market size is expected to grow 6.25x to $25 billion. With significant growth in HBM3E chip shipments, Micron is expected to realize a significant climb in both revenue and margins in fiscal 2025. Micron's HBM3E chips have a significant advantage in performance and energy efficiency, with an expected 20% improvement in energy efficiency. This is particularly important for data center and AI applications. In particular, the strong demand for memory in the AI market provides great scope for Micron's products. NVIDIA's latest earnings report has proven that there is no slowdown in corporate investment in AI-related devices (such as GPUs), which cannot be supported by Micron's high-performance memory. Currently, 69% of Micron's revenue comes from DRAM products, and I expect that percentage could increase to 70-75% in fiscal 2025. With the double increase in HBM chip shipments and selling prices, Micron's revenue structure will be more optimized, and profitability will be further improved. Micron has demonstrated strong shareholder returns over the past few years, having repurchased $4.4 billion of stock since FY2021. If the HBM market continues to grow strongly, I believe Micron may further increase buybacks in the future. The current 12.8% earnings yield also shows its attractiveness as an investment in the semiconductor space. My Investment View Overall, I am confident in Micron's future. It has demonstrated strong growth potential with its HBM technology leadership and deep integration with the AI market. What's more, the current valuation provides a large margin of safety for investment. I believe Micron's revenue and margins are poised for a significant boost as HBM3E shipments grow significantly in FY2025. Micron's share price is likely to double over the next 12-18 months. In my view, Micron is not only a value play in the AI/semiconductor space, but also has strong growth momentum.
