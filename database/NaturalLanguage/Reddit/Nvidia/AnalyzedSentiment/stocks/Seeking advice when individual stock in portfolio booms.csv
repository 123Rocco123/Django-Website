,"I was a naive 15 year old and put whatever I had in Nvidia and a couple other individual tech stocks in 2014. Inferably it is doing well but it takes up the majority of my portfolio. Regardless of all of the research I do, I still can't determine if selling is the way to go. I understand the volatility behind individual stocks however if I am up 2,643% from my original cost basis then I can't wrap my mind around pulling out and re-investing in index funds. My portfolio is quite literally VTI, VXUS, and ton of Nvidia. Any input or advice is appreciated!","Easiest: Sell a small portion equal to your original investment to put aside, set some sell stops and let it ride.",0,0.514,0.984,POSITIVE

What percentages do you have?Right now I'm slowly diversifying my account as a fellow young person as it's 48% apple since I bought $2500 of apple in 2014 which has turned into 25K and 50% of my account. While I'm keeping it as is for the most part, I'm spreading that money to other good long term options just incase it crashes. The thing is at the end of the day if Nvidia drops 50% of its current value, you're still up a crazy amount, and do to what they make, will be relevant for decades. Just be careful because you may qualify for capital gains if you sell them, and I believe even if it is reinvested you'd still potentially owe that money.",0,0.545,1.0,NEGATIVE

I use schwab and it shows me my unrealized gains(Very scary number because I know I get hit with capital gains if I sell) + more tax info on that I believe. Just before you do any selling do your research, and if its a large enough sum talk to a financial advisor because it'll be cheaper then being slapped with an audit. Otherwise I'd recommend pulling it back a little maybe just 5-10% of it to be split into whatever you feel good about. I'd personally recommend a 50/50 split between long-term and short term since we're about the same age. Want some short term good growth so you can use it as money for stuff like buying a house, or a car, something like that, and then long term for retirement or if you plan on having kids college tuiton etc through stuff like vanguard since, don't quote me on this, there may be tax laws regarding moving money from investments into ira's/401ks that ease the tax burden. Once again if its enough money, and you wanna move a decent amount around to a better future setup with multiple goals I'd highly, highly recommend meeting at least once with a financial advisor.",2,0.523,0.761,NEGATIVE
