What will be the hottest company in 2025?","I assume that the decade horizon that you are mentioning is referring to the general quantum computing industry and to the broad belief that it'll take another 10 years at least to have quantum computers that are superior by all means to super classical computers.I think that it is really a debate on what type of technology each quantum company is pursuing. So far the biggest players have been developing superconducting technology, which however are difficult to scale up due to their huge need for refrigerating systems (i.e. the hardware needed to cool down the circuits is bigger than the quantum computer). This is only one challenge, there are definitely several milestones to be reached before we get to quantum supremacy. That's why until today it's broadly assumed that it will take us another 10 years before we get to commercially useful quantum computers.However, the industry has moved quickly over the recent years and different approaches have been explored. Moreover, with the advancing of AI and their ever growing energy needs, there is a reason to develop quantum systems that while not being necessarily superior to super classical computers, will be able to perform some tasks faster and with less energy consumption.So this point alone is shortening the timeline for commercially useful quantum solutions.Speaking specifically of IONQ, they are a pure quantum player, not like IBM or GOOG, and their approach is based on trapped ions, which have the advantage of working at room temperature. The size of their systems fits regular data centers, which is another direction that the company is taking. The development of solutions that will integrate with classical computers to provide hybrid computing systems.In terms of the company's development, at the time of the inception, they published a roadmap according to which they were estimating 2026 the year when they would have been able to offer a quantum computer superior to any other super classical computer. Now, take this with a pound of salt of course, but if you check the roadmap, you'll see that they met all the tech and financial milestones. In addition to this, they are developing commercial solutions beyond the production of hardware. They are working on quantum algorithms that will provide customers with commercial value. In the latest earning call they announced that they are working on a new quantum application and that they will present it at the next earning call. IONQ is already attracting the interest of both government and commercial customers, forming a base for future revenues.The industry is really moving fast. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has just approved new standards for post-quantum cryptography. There is already the need to develop quantum solutions for practical purposes, national security in this specific case. It is really a moment when there are many moving parts and we are getting close to the day where all these pieces will come in place and revenues will start growing exponentially.Lastly, if you look at the stock action of this year, the price has been on a downward trend, which isn't nice for anyone that has already invested in the company, but it is forming a base around the 7 level. If you start following the company and get your own idea of what they do, this can be a good entry point.

I can't speak for the chemistry side of things, but in terms of using technology to benefit their mining, processing, and overall operations, it's super inefficient.They laid off the entirety of the GIS and drone guys, so their plan is pretty much just dig and hope there's lithium I guess. The company is also incredibly reliant on contractors and third party software vendors. C-suite is swayed by the classic ego stroking vendors and salesman, while the executives don't seem to know or care about what is going on. They were also found guilty of bribery charges to get around regulations in foreign countries, and they had to pay a big multi-million dollar settlement for that.I wouldn't recommend working there or buying their stock unless maybe you're a chemical engineer who knows better than me.Another thing too though, at the end of the day, ALB stock will go up or down mostly based off of the Lithium price.
