I do think that the market has become more of a casino than it ever has and most people seem more interested than ever in piling into what's hot and less patient than ever with anything that isn't. Mag 7 have worked, have been popular and that playbook (with a handful of periods as noteworthy exceptions) has worked for over a decade and it will until it doesn't.

Am I wrong?","Big Tech is intrinsically not innovative, if you look at it from a dollar spend perspective:Google, particularly under Sergei Brin tried incredibly hard to become innovative by acquiring startups and funding research labs. The amount of capital these companies have to spend on R&D dwarfs the budgets of many small countries, but the ROI for 99% of projects is negative.At an absolute level, the research labs like Meta FAIR and Google Brain produce some enormously impactful output. Google in particular was where the transformer architecture that underpins most modern LLMs and generative models comes from. But ironically, as with most research, the talent behind that innovation has dispersed, and Google itself is not really the prime beneficiary of such breakthroughs.So big tech innovates, but not as much as you'd expect given the level of capital and spending being applied. And the innovation that happens that you hear about tends to be open sourced, not necessarily helping the business of these companies.Investors do not pile into these companies for their innovation, regardless of the positive optics that brings. Investors invest into monopolies. Just as with Bell labs (a telecom monopoly that did groundbreaking research), the golden goose is the monopoly, and the R&D is window dressing.",0,0.518,0.999,NEGATIVE

I'm inclined to agree with this statement.The OP is asking about investing in these companies on the basis of their level of innovation.My point is that this rationale for investing is not a good one. The Attention is All You Need authors all left. People like Noam Shazeer (co-author of the Attention is All You Need paper) who fought hard to get PaLM built into Google's products were rebuffed at every turn until they left in frustration to found their own companies.The company spent billions to be innovative, but bureaucracy kicked the actual innovation out.

What I find interesting is that you don't seem to understand what that means. IBM is still a company, and they continued to grow after the inflection point that Google is now going through. In their case it was in the 90s, when they slashed benefits, laid off senior employees, and became a company that was no longer THE place to work at. The 90s is when IBM had IT's first set of mass layoffs. Google just had theirs a year or two back, and is doing all the same things now. I'd expect the same results. You don't get into the position that IBM is in overnight, it takes decades.Because Googles ecosystem is still growing double digits...Sure, they've got a ton of inertia, and a monopoly position in a number of areas. IBM still has a monopoly on mainframes, and was still making mass bank in the 90s as they slowly shed anything that was going to be new and innovative.

Google will make over $100 billion dollars this year which is up from $73 billion in 2023 and $59 billion in 2024.So Google's growth has accelerated.But the biggest difference is reach. There is no company on this planet in all of the history of man that has ever had anywhere near the reach Google enjoys.Google has the most popular web site ever. There has never been a web site anywhere near as popular.But then Google owns the second most popular web site ever with YouTube.Google has the most popular operating system ever with Android.Google has the most popular browser ever with Chrome.Google has the most popular photo site ever with Google Photos.Google completely owns navigation around the world with the most popular navigation system with Google Maps.Google has the most popular OTT in the US and nobody else is even close any longer.But honestly we have not seen anything yet. Google has been investing like crazy over the last 15 years and we are now going to see the return on that massive investment over the next decade.You are going to see an Alphabet far bigger than what you are seeing today.Waymo alone is 5+ years ahead going after a trillion dollar market and it is only one application of Google's AI. There will be countless others.Google was just so damn innovative to do the TPUs over 12 years ago and now that gives Google a HUGE competitive advantage.Google is the only one of the big guys that does NOT have to stand in line at Nvidia. Google just released their sixth generation TPUs which were a 5x improvement over the fifth generation and now working on the seventh.This means Google controls the entire stack from top to bottom. Sillicon all the way up to the applications like what they shared today.,5,0.534,0.993,POSITIVE

You can’t conduct a below minimum amount research some of the most innovative companies in all of science and technology, and then dismiss them as “not innovative” lol.

The true innovators in technology are not always rich and successful because of their inventions but because they successfully transformed and MARKETED the inventions of others.Apple is a good example. I agree they are top of mind and the most innovative of the mobile phone companies, but did they invent it? NO. They actually combined the inventions of others into one device and marketed it extremely well. Motorola invented the cellphone, Compaq and Palm did the handheld touch screen device, Sony and others had the portable music. Other patents were leveraged by Apple to create their device. Steve Jobs was innovative in vision and marketing, but not tech. The tech innovators went uncredited except to get royalties for their inventions.Amazon did not invent cloud computing. IBM, HP, Microsoft and others worked on development of utility computing 20 years ago, which Amazon evolved into their cloud computing using proprietary and standard hw components. Microsoft bought various companies to evolve theirs. They were each better in marketing theirs than IBM, HP or Oracle was.Google grew from the bones of the prominent search engine of the 90s, Digital Equipment Corp Altavista. Their development and the bungling of other search engines set them to prominence.BTW, all this AI investment like Nvidia is a bit scarey. I have no doubt that AI will yield benefits, but it is a bit like 25 years ago when the market went dot-com crazy, only to see a bubble bust. About 20% of US investments are tied up in those big 7.",0,0.529,0.993,NEGATIVE

The biggest technology innovation in probably 20+ years has been Attention is all you need.Google makes the HUGE innovation, patents it, shares in a paper and then lets everyone use license free.Just today they shared another absolutely huge innovation.https://x.com/GoogleDeepMind/status/1816498082860667086?t=eZMO2EkbhUswdOCgIf3UiQ&s=19I would expect to see just an amazing array of innovation around AI over the next decade.
