I remember coming on here in 2022 and everyone was so bearish, and confidently so. Which is always so funny because during bull markets you’ll constantly hear people say “buy when there’s blood in the streets”. But, then the blood in the streets actually comes and it’s “this is the next lost decade”. And “Lol hedge funds are dumping their shares on you”.Then the price starts going up and they stay in cash. Then the price keeps going up and they stay in cash. Then after 3-6 months of rallying, they finally buy right before a pullback. Then comes the “market’s rigged”, “dO u KnOw aBoUt dArk PooLs??”, “classic hedge fund manipulation”.Sentiment generally follows price, but we’re seeing a lot of top callers on reddit which makes me still bullish even at these levels.",2,0.514,0.989,NEGATIVE
