Eventually all will return to normal as long as TSM remains able to sell to USA and ASML remains isolated from the conflicts.If companies like Qualcomm and Intel or others like AMD can somehow make headway the competition may be both good and bad for the space.

It is losing steam probably will taper off early next year. Remember how Faang lasted and even Mags is showing signs of weakness. As for IC industry there is a major layoff at Intl and AMD while SMIC is closer getting delisted and booted out of S&P. As for sector rotation it started this summer.
