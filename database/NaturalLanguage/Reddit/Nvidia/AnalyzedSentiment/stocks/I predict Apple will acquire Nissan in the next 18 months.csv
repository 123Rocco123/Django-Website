The automotive industry has always been a struggle. High competition, high capex, and extremely low margins. All of these is the exact opposite of what Apple looks for. They can probably get around the competition due to their ecosystem, and get around the costs due to them making so much money already. However that still probably wouldn’t change the margins. Apple makes around a 40-50% profit margin on all of their devices while car companies typically make a 3-9% margins on a car which is horrible because the costs to make and sell are just way too high.Imo it’s not efficient for Apple to go into this at all and I would rather them use their cash to continue expanding their subscription services, grow their margins, expanding their plants into other parts of the world, and continue doing buybacks and dividends for investors.
