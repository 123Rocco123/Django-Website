Xbox is a smaller part of Microsoft's portfolio and it's hard to quantify their performance relative to the rest of the company. Similar story at Sony. This makes Nintendo the only pure gaming hardware company.I've had success with Nintendo as an investment in the past, about halfway through the switch life cycle. Microsoft has taken an investment approach where they purchase established studios and see what they can get out of them. That didn't work out too well for EA until very recently, so I doubt it'll show major returns for them. Sony has a lot of newer and non japanese talent that they've built from the ground up almost like start up investing. They have a formula that works for them.I say all that to compare to Nintendo, which takes a very different approach. Where Sony and Microsoft tend to compete on a raw output, Nintendo produces novelty. They have a talented pool of game developers they've curated over 40 years. They've recently disclosed their current strategy to mitigate rising development costs with smaller ""AA"" sized games.The problem with novelty hardware is you have no idea if it'll be a quick gimmick or massive hit. The Wii was genuinely revolutionary. The Wii U was a total flop. The Switch was revolutionary, what will the next console hold? It will be hard to say until it already happens. I wouldn't expect an official announcement of hardware to be too massive of a swing in either way. Ideally it'll be as easy as it is now for 3rd party developers to add it. Whether or not their next thing moves consoles is important and not a guarantee. More interesting I think is their pivot to smaller games.",0,0.522,POSITIVE,0.903

What does everyone else think? I’d like to hear about other companies other than Nvidia and Apple all the time.","I’ve watched Nintendo for about 20 years now and have some good insight in how the company is run. Fundamentally I believe in their success and long term growth. They have never placed a big interest in the notion of returning value to shareholders but they are one of the few true “good guy” companies i know and so paradoxically I’ve kept my investment with them.Just don’t expect them to engage in similar shenanigans as your favorite tech company. Pumping the stock price has historically been low on their list of priorities.TLDR: invest in them if you believe in the products and want to support, but understand there are likely better places if the goal is simple capital growth",0,0.564,POSITIVE,0.953
