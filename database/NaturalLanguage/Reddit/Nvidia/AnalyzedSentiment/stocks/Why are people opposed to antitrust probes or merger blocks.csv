,"Antitrust courts and merger blocks are necessary for a competitive market to work for all economic actors in a capitalist system. There are countless economy studies about it and how it is actually better for all economic actors to not have monopolies, duopolies etc. Now reading comments on this sub, it seems like people are experts in this difficult domain of antitrust law and almost always side with the companies that potentially break the law. Why is that? Even if you have shares in that company, you will end up better by having a competitive market. I.e. we are all nvidia shareholders if you bought S&P, but it would be better for other companies (and long-term for S&P) to fight a monopoly if there is one and ensure that the rules are respected and nobody abuses a monopoly. To me this anti FTC, anti DOJ reaction is short sighted and hurts the long term interests of all shareholders, no matter what shares you bought. 30% of my portfolio is GOOG stock and I believe the DoJ case is the best thing that happens to them. A monopolist is lazy, ineficient, not innovating enough because they have their revenue secured. No matter the DoJ decision, it will be breaking the status quo and push GOOG to innovate and create more value for shareholders. The same thing for NVDA. Long term, the worst for them is to be a monopolist and maintain the status quo. Until they become Boeing.

But I also have to agree with the prior poster that it’s about uncertainty. If I invest in Nvidia, it’s because I saw their long term investment finally pay off. Just a few years ago, they were just one of the many tech companies around and their valuation certainly didn’t match the levels of companies like Microsoft, Apple and Amazon. But their long term commitment to their field finally paid off and it feels like they’re being punished for that.",2,0.536,NEGATIVE,1.0

Long term it is healthy but people hate the short term damage it does to their investments. I’d add in also it makes people have to rethink and possibly even rework their investment portfolios depending on the case and whatever results occur which is obnoxious too. People like planting money and letting it sit without work and thinking. You’re making them work and think now. Which tends to be why many advise those that hate more active investing stick with ETFs/Mutual Funds mostly so they’re constantly rebalanced and they don’t have to think about it much ever,0,0.515,NEGATIVE,0.937

This leads people in tech to believe that the government is likely going to fuck shit up badly. So they want the government to stay out of it and oppose these probes.Now, this certainly wasn't always the case, but since 2016 and the whole Facebook election interference saga the sentiment in both camps definitely has turned sour and uncooperative. Thus the general lack of trust nowadays. If there was more trust between tech and the government, it's quite likely that people in tech wouldn't oppose these probes.I'm in tech, so I'm obviously biased. I'll try to give you my (very biased) view of why all this opposition:1/ There has been a lot of negativity towards tech in media for multiple years now. Many people (including me) feel that most of it is quite unjustified, and we are basically made into scapegoats for some stupid political games that we would have preferred to stay out off. Many of the antitrust probes feel flimsical in their justification (the GOOGL one being among the more solid ones) and thus feel more like political games than justified by actual economic interest. This sentiment is further aggravated by the fact that the DoJ keeps losing many of its antitrust probes.2/ Tech companies' economic activities and incentives are highly complex, with lots of trade offs, and the view is that the government has an overly simplistic picture of these trade offs, or simply doesn't acknowledge them. The worry is that (whether due to lack of knowledge or care) the DOJ/FTC will get some of these trade offs wrong, which will cause a lot of blast damage that hurst both the consumer and general economic activity. (E.g. the GOOGL case could easily kill Firefox, basically leading to a duopoly of GOOGL/AAPL for browser engines, with GOOGL being a monopoly outside of Apple's ecosystem.) This is something that is already playing out right now outside of the US. The EU has gone much further with legislation, including GDPR and the DMA, and there is the not uncommon view that these legislations are not actually benefiting consumers in any meaningful way (and are in fact actively causing consumer harm and harming economic activity). So the worry is that, like the EU, the FTC/DOJ are going to get things badly wrong and cause more harm than good.3/ The merger blocks basically cut off one of the common outs for VCs, effectively reducing the expected return on their investments. As such, there is less interest in pumping money into one of the US' biggest growth drivers, directly causing a huge cooling off of economic activity. Obviously, sometimes merger blocks are necessary, but general hostility towards merges is poison for the type of investments that were and are responsible for creating a huge amount of wealth in the US.",0,0.514,NEGATIVE,1.0

That's why Google's initial defense was that Google Search was just the best algorithm on the market, and the DOJ actually never challenged that point - their key argument is that exclusive distribution deals block competitors from even building new search algorithms.As an aside, there are few things more grating than having someone accuse other people of having ""never taken an economics class"" and then say a bunch of stuff that contradicts Econ 101.",2,0.527,NEGATIVE,0.999

There are countless economy studies about it and how it is actually better for all economic actors to not have monopolies, duopolies etc. Now reading comments on this sub, it seems like people are experts in this difficult domain of antitrust law and almost always side with the companies that potentially break the law. Why is that? Even if you have shares in that company, you will end up better by having a competitive market. I.e. we are all nvidia shareholders if you bought S&P, but it would be better for other companies (and long-term for S&P) to fight a monopoly if there is one and ensure that the rules are respected and nobody abuses a monopoly. To me this anti FTC, anti DOJ reaction is short sighted and hurts the long term interests of all shareholders, no matter what shares you bought. 30% of my portfolio is GOOG stock and I believe the DoJ case is the best thing that happens to them. A monopolist is lazy, ineficient, not innovating enough because they have their revenue secured. No matter the DoJ decision, it will be breaking the status quo and push GOOG to innovate and create more value for shareholders. The same thing for NVDA. Long term, the worst for them is to be a monopolist and maintain the status quo. Until they become Boeing. TLDR: No matter what stock you bought, if you are in for the long term, it is in your interest for all the companies to play by the rules and have a competitive, anti-monopolistic, market.",They tend to be fishing expeditions,0,0.507,POSITIVE,0.992

The FTC, kind of decides to pursue cases based on their perception and then simply digs up some laws they want to apply to that specific case. The threats to move against US steel is a political play so the political appointees at the FTC can support unions. The US could benefit from the foreign investment in the US plants by a staunch ally of the US. The US Steel business is not currently competitive, so buys of steel look for other alternatives, maybe Chineses steel. The big consumers in the US could significantly benefit from better processes and upgraded production facilities here, which they cannot afford to do otherwise.Next, the FTC stepping in on the supermarket merger is another poor idea. Kroger and Albertson need to merger to better compete and be competitive with the biggest grocery store in the country, Walmart.If the FTC, really wanted to do something useful for consumers, they would wade into the inefficiencies and perhaps price fixing in both the homeowners and auto insurance businesses. In the case of auto insurance. It is a legal requirement, so raping US on rates is a formality. Home insurance is nearly the same as the lenders require coverage. No one is ever looking after the consumer. The insurance companies get so pushback from states and threaten to withdraw for the state. This issue needs a national government approach, where they lose the license to sell in all states if they choose to pull out. That is a level playing field. The FTC cases should be about helping the consumers not the shareholders, that is the DOJ.I rest my case.",0,0.522,NEGATIVE,1.0
