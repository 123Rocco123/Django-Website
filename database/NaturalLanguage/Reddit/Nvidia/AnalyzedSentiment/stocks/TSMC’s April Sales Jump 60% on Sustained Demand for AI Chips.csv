,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. saw April sales jump 60% to NT$236 billion ($7.3 billion) as sustained artificial intelligence demand was helped by the beginnings of a recovery in consumer electronics. The world’s largest contract chipmaker is running well ahead of estimates for revenue growth in the current quarter, after sales increased by 34.3% in March, buoyed largely by insatiable appetite for AI semiconductors. The global smartphone industry returned to growth over the first three months of the year, including in the highly competitive Chinese market, which may drive orders for TSMC’s traditional mainstay of mobile chips. US-traded shares were up 3% in New York in early trading on Friday. Hsinchu-based TSMC weathered a year of muted demand for personal electronics last year, which Nvidia Corp.’s highly sought-after AI chips helped make more tolerable. Now the AI boost is pairing with rising prospects for consumer demand, though TSMC Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei has cautioned about the pace of any recovery.
