He could be right and the acceptable target could still be a ways off.My guess is we will see a really good self driving product in 5-10 years. Maybe less, possibly more. The interesting part is that doesnt have to be an EV. If Tesla pulls it off it will be something to behold. The rub will be getting Musk to license it at a reasonable price so it will be mass adopted. My issue with it right now as a person with a Tesla 3 is that it runs fine and then without warning has an issue. During the freebie test period I found it had major issues with the train tracks I cross everyday (it wanted to drift lanes a small amount during the crossing) and it had major issues when turning right immediately afterwards. It almost hit the curb until I took control. The turning issue popped up once or twice in a few other spots. Beyond that it was fine. However that not fine moment was caught because I was paying attention and reacted before it became an accident. An inexperienced or inattentive driver will have accidents with this version.I know the idea of self driving cars on the face of it seems risky, but it might actually be the better alternative if they get it truly working well. When they get it running really well it may actually be a case of insurance rates going down if you are letting the car drive you. Im certain we will always need to be able to drive ourselves to a degree for off pavement stuff or unmarked parking lots, but for a lot of people this is going to be the better path. What is going to suck is that unless someone else makes it work we are likely looking at Musk controlling this and he appears to be difficult to work reasonable deals with.",2,0.512,1.0,NEGATIVE
