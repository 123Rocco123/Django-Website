,"If you look at the story of how the S&P500 has performed so well over the past decade, the answer is high return on invested capital from tech companies. By hiring top engineers to build innovative products, and scaling the product globally, these companies to achieved rapid growth at little cost, resulting in impressive returns to shareholders. Historically, hardware costs were very cheap to scale compared to the revenue it brings in. You could spend a few thousand per month in hosting costs, and bring in millions in profits. However, this is changing. 7 out of 10 of the top holdings in the S&P500 are gambling huge on AI- they have laid off tens of thousands of the talented engineers that drove their earnings growth, in order to fund expensive acquisitions of AI hardware(Not counting Nvidia because they are the ones profiting from it). Tech can no longer be seen as an industry with low capital costs, because AI is tremendously expensive to deploy and maintain. For example, Microsoft expects to spend $100 Billion on AI datacenters through Fiscal 2027. That's 40% more than their entire profit in 2023. Because AI hardware is so expensive, and the electricity usage is so tremendous, these future applications are no longer cheap to deploy and maintain. ChatGPT is perhaps the best example of this. Despite being tremendously successful from a growth perspective, it has been tremendously unprofitable from an operating standpoint, and relies on continued bailouts from large companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Softbank to stay afloat. The economics of tech companies is quickly changing; with companies in an arms race to acquire as many Nvidia chips as possible to build the best GenAI applications, they are hurting their margins and operating profitability. The impact of these investments has been quite lousy so far; other than some round tripping transactions to create fake revenue and balance sheet growth, these ai investments, while tremendously expensive, have not paid off: Microsoft's CoPilot has been a complete failure, consumers are not buying CoPilot pcs, and the CoPilot app has a 2.3 star rating on the Windows store. They are also facing regulatory pressure in Europe over Recall. Google's AI is providing dangerous and potentially deadly misinformation to users of its search engine, such as incorrect advice about prescriptions. Amazon's ""Go"" stores were supposed to use ML/AI to handle checkouts, when in reality, the AI failed to handle most of the work, and the remainder was just outsourced to human operators in India which struggled to keep up with the workload. Tesla has still failed to implement full self driving, and during its robotaxi event, had human actors control the robots to fake them being AI controlled. Google's Waymo is very impressive from a technology standpoint, but its hardware costs and regulatory barriers make it unlikely to achieve profitability, even as it expands. Despite the poor results of AI investments so far, all of the top 10 holdings in the S&P500 other than Berkshire Hathaway trade at very high P/E Ratio, suggesting that very high earnings growth is priced in. Even if AI will have a significant impact on the economy and society, the economics of it are not favorable to investors due to the high capex costs involved. Tech is no longer an industry where a team of 10-20 engineers can build a product that brings in Billions in revenue, with minimal hosting costs. It is now an industry where Billions of capital expenditures are needed just to build a model, and margins on the finished product are very poor. Of course, tech CEOs realize this; which is why Microsoft, OpenAI, and Google are all working to replace Nvidia hardware, which sells at a huge markup, with their own in house chips. This is a tremendous threat to Nvidia's long term prospects. Given the high expectations implied by elevated price to earnings ratios, and the poor financial performance of AI applications, it does seem quite unlikely that large caps will continue to outperform. Small cap value and international stocks are almost certainly a better investment; if AI does drive significant productivity improvements, then labor heavy businesses will benefit from improved margins from using these products that large tech companies are offering. Looking at small cap value funds like AVUV, and international stock indexes, there are a tremendous amount of labor intensive businesses with low margins in these funds that would benefit from AI/ML. Net margins going from 3% to 10% due to improved productivity would mean earnings more than tripling. This has historically been the case with technical revolutions. For example, railroads revolutionized our economy and drove tremendous economic growth, but they provided terrible returns to shareholders.","Alright, this is not as deranged as I thought it would be reading the title.

There are going to be longer-term beneficiaries beyond just owning tech. That said, I think these beneficiaries are definitely going to be more specific than owning indexes. This thread also goes into all the reasons why AI has disappointed while talking about beneficiaries - it doesn't seem like you're that confident in the ability to deliver on the end product/s when it comes to AI.I think the timing is very difficult. I don't disagree with what you're saying in regards to spending and I'll admit that I thought this cycle would be a giant version of smaller previous NVDA cycles - and it still probably will, but on a longer/much longer time frame than I'd expected. Yes, mega cap tech is spending hundreds of billions of dollars on this. No, shareholders don't really care yet and what does it take to change so many people's one investment playbook from basically ""own mega cap tech?""I don't know and to try and predict that/""call the top"" because one thinks it's an eventuality without any indications of things starting to erode is going to lead to disappointment.So, I don't disagree with some of the things you mention but the specifics are tough - I do think that there's an interesting conversation about AI beneficiaries. I talked about VST early this year on here as an AI beneficiary and the response was crickets because it was like nobody wanted to hear anything AI-related that wasn't tech. Mag 7 have had a good year, but things that are beneficiaries of all that spending - NVDA primarily, but things like VRT - have had a better year imo. I mean, two of the top performing stocks this year are utilities that have mooned because of expected energy demand.I think that there are potentially interesting discussions on people's guesses for beneficiaries in terms of productivity and there's not enough discussion on here of what's being impacted - call center software (FIVN) clearly not a beneficiary. ADBE is struggling.Jumping into something like small cap value may be a better investment starting soon (although there's nothing that I can see that would indicate that) or the way things are going this could easily go on for another couple of years.",0,0.54,NEGATIVE,1.0

For example, Microsoft expects to spend $100 Billion on AI datacenters through Fiscal 2027. That's 40% more than their entire profit in 2023. Because AI hardware is so expensive, and the electricity usage is so tremendous, these future applications are no longer cheap to deploy and maintain. ChatGPT is perhaps the best example of this. Despite being tremendously successful from a growth perspective, it has been tremendously unprofitable from an operating standpoint, and relies on continued bailouts from large companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Softbank to stay afloat. The economics of tech companies is quickly changing; with companies in an arms race to acquire as many Nvidia chips as possible to build the best GenAI applications, they are hurting their margins and operating profitability. The impact of these investments has been quite lousy so far; other than some round tripping transactions to create fake revenue and balance sheet growth, these ai investments, while tremendously expensive, have not paid off: Microsoft's CoPilot has been a complete failure, consumers are not buying CoPilot pcs, and the CoPilot app has a 2.3 star rating on the Windows store. They are also facing regulatory pressure in Europe over Recall. Google's AI is providing dangerous and potentially deadly misinformation to users of its search engine, such as incorrect advice about prescriptions. Amazon's ""Go"" stores were supposed to use ML/AI to handle checkouts, when in reality, the AI failed to handle most of the work, and the remainder was just outsourced to human operators in India which struggled to keep up with the workload. Tesla has still failed to implement full self driving, and during its robotaxi event, had human actors control the robots to fake them being AI controlled. Google's Waymo is very impressive from a technology standpoint, but its hardware costs and regulatory barriers make it unlikely to achieve profitability, even as it expands. Despite the poor results of AI investments so far, all of the top 10 holdings in the S&P500 other than Berkshire Hathaway trade at very high P/E Ratio, suggesting that very high earnings growth is priced in. Even if AI will have a significant impact on the economy and society, the economics of it are not favorable to investors due to the high capex costs involved. Tech is no longer an industry where a team of 10-20 engineers can build a product that brings in Billions in revenue, with minimal hosting costs. It is now an industry where Billions of capital expenditures are needed just to build a model, and margins on the finished product are very poor. Of course, tech CEOs realize this; which is why Microsoft, OpenAI, and Google are all working to replace Nvidia hardware, which sells at a huge markup, with their own in house chips. This is a tremendous threat to Nvidia's long term prospects. Given the high expectations implied by elevated price to earnings ratios, and the poor financial performance of AI applications, it does seem quite unlikely that large caps will continue to outperform. Small cap value and international stocks are almost certainly a better investment; if AI does drive significant productivity improvements, then labor heavy businesses will benefit from improved margins from using these products that large tech companies are offering. Looking at small cap value funds like AVUV, and international stock indexes, there are a tremendous amount of labor intensive businesses with low margins in these funds that would benefit from AI/ML.
