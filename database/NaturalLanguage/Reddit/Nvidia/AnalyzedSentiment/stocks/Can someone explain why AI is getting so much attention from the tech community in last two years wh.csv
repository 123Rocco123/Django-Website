,"Its not like AI hasn't been around for years now. It's also not like Nvidia just released CUDA and graphic cards capable of doing AI work. Its also not like Machine Learning is new. Machine Learning has been used in scientific research for a long time now (atleast in Physics/Astronomy). Look at Cyberpunk video game. It released in 2020 and started development in 2016. It used AI to lip-sync character conversations into 10 languages. This was back in 2016-2020. GPT-1,2,3 was released in 2018/19/20. Here's a part from wiki about LLM - ""Although decoder-only GPT-1 was introduced in 2018, it was GPT-2 in 2019 that caught widespread attention because OpenAI at first deemed it too powerful to release publicly, out of fear of malicious use."". Looking at that Sam Altman/Microsoft etc didn't think they should pour trillions into it or just buy all Nvidia chips? Nvidia earnings actually went down in 2019 lol. All these companies knew about it years before. So what changed? Is it just that ChatGPT became public and people realised what it could do? or is there a more technical reason that justifies this? I looked at dot-com bubble. That was spurred by creation of public Web which became accessible in 1993 - so naturally only after 1993 could people even imagine websites etc and then there were new startups blah blah. Something, that couldn't have been anticipated, actually changed to cause the hype and new funding. But this time around it seems to me like nothing fundamentally changed. Did companies/investors just overlook use of AI until 2022? Then looking at ChatGPT suddenly realised they were missing out on a trillion dollar industry that will revolutionize human lives? I am really confused about what happened. So please ELI5. Edit - I will summarize what people are saying in comments and share this tweet someone commented- https://x.com/buccocapital/status/1828407633541296603 Most important part is about scaling laws and emergent properties. Essentially - AI is showing unexpectedly ""intelligent"" properties at higher compute powers (emergent properties) and these companies now believe that this will scale at even higher compute powers. No one know what will happen. It might happen that the emergent properties was a one time thing and AI may never get more intelligent or it will continue and we get a ""Digital God"" (according to the tweet). So something did change in last couple of years, and the reason no one invested before was because no one saw it coming and it was an emergent property.","Most of the world had no idea that artificial intelligence was already in use.  Then a really good release of ChatGPT took the world by storm and we all got a taste of really impressive generative AI.  Now the scramble to find a profitable use case is on, and whoever gets it right will benefit tremendously.With so much hype surrounding it, CEOs across the globe are facing enormous pressure to use it in their organizations.  But the problem with finding an actual, profitable use case remains.  And like every other breakthrough in technology, war, criminals, and porn will find the most uses.",0,0.528,POSITIVE,0.962

The release of GPT was exciting, but only in academic circles. OpenAI paying tons of labor hours to web scrape and label data for ChatGPT (not to be confused with GPT) was putting their money where their mouth was. ChatGPT 3 and 4 being the first models that really mimic human English speech and are also generally factualy correct are then later what got them accepted as impressive by the less technical investing public.ChatGPT is a product based on the core GPT algorithm. It was originally developed more as a proof of concept and a case study than a true alternative to Google or something. Because Microsoft is the biggest financer of OpenAI, it's all been productized. Because GPT is open source, other products like Google Bard, musk's Gronk on X, and Microsoft/Github Copilot exist on the same core technologies with variations in implementation. They are not just giving you ChatGPT in new clothes, they are giving you a brand new ChatGPT. Almost everyone else saying some shit about GPT or AI in their earnings calls are throwing white smoke because it will pump their stock price for a day, when in reality it'll probably just be paying some absurd fee to openAI for horrible customer service bot that can't do what they want it to do.

Notice how a whole new term, AGI, started being thrown around to distinguish from what we have today.Now I'm not saying AI is useless. Far from it, AI in its current form is an invaluable tool. However, it doesn't even come close to living up to the hype. Moreover, progress isn't as rapid as the companies hype it up to be, and true reliable accuracy may not be possible with current technology.

Moore's Law basically states that computing power doubles roughly every 24 mos. Yann LeCun created CNNs decades ago. CNNs are computationally intensive. They really didn't make an impact until advances in hardware unlocked their power.Compute power has crossed a threshold that will allow software exponential growth in capability.However, the next limiting factor may be electricity. Some say that GAI won't be achieved until we can solve the electricity problem.Once that is unlocked, then AI scientists will be created. On average, it takes 28 years to create 1 human scientist. Human scientists can only work 8-12 hours per day. Once Ai Scientists are achieved, we can create 100 millions of them who will work 24/7/365. Every unanswered question in the universe will eventually be solved. Every human biological mystery will be revealed.Every major company and country knows that the group who wins the intelligence race, wins it all.Presently, the US is the most dominant. We are about 3-10 yrs ahead of China, next closest competitor.There aren't any other countries with the brain talent, manufacturing infrastructure, financial resources, and electricity to compete. Ever wondered why China pushed so hard to move to renewable energy that its now surpassed the US? Renewable energy, esp solar, is ""limitless"". Fossil energy is not.Maybe India and the EU have an equal standing behind China but for different reasons don't have much of a chance in this race. But, India keeps sending their brightest minds to the USA.

So something did change in last couple of years, and the reason no one invested before was because no one saw it coming and it was an emergent property.","In the semester just before ChatGPT was released, I took a class on digital innovation. The professor asked if anyone had used a chatbot that could effectively answer their questions, and no one raised their hand. At that time, it was widely accepted that chatbots were pretty terrible and unusable. The following semester, after ChatGPT came out, I had another class where we were assigned to create a chatbot. Since the professor had planned the syllabus before ChatGPT’s release, we had to use older technology. We had to get people to try our chatbots. Everyone just wondered why we couldn’t ""just use ChatGPT.""ChatGPT was a game changer in conversational AI, paving the way for the current wave of Generative AI advancements.",0,0.525,NEGATIVE,0.999
,"Its not like AI hasn't been around for years now. It's also not like Nvidia just released CUDA and graphic cards capable of doing AI work. Its also not like Machine Learning is new. Machine Learning has been used in scientific research for a long time now (atleast in Physics/Astronomy). Look at Cyberpunk video game. It released in 2020 and started development in 2016. It used AI to lip-sync character conversations into 10 languages. This was back in 2016-2020. GPT-1,2,3 was released in 2018/19/20. Here's a part from wiki about LLM - ""Although decoder-only GPT-1 was introduced in 2018, it was GPT-2 in 2019 that caught widespread attention because OpenAI at first deemed it too powerful to release publicly, out of fear of malicious use."". Looking at that Sam Altman/Microsoft etc didn't think they should pour trillions into it or just buy all Nvidia chips? Nvidia earnings actually went down in 2019 lol. All these companies knew about it years before. So what changed? Is it just that ChatGPT became public and people realised what it could do? or is there a more technical reason that justifies this? I looked at dot-com bubble. That was spurred by creation of public Web which became accessible in 1993 - so naturally only after 1993 could people even imagine websites etc and then there were new startups blah blah. Something, that couldn't have been anticipated, actually changed to cause the hype and new funding. But this time around it seems to me like nothing fundamentally changed. Did companies/investors just overlook use of AI until 2022? Then looking at ChatGPT suddenly realised they were missing out on a trillion dollar industry that will revolutionize human lives? I am really confused about what happened. So please ELI5. Edit - I will summarize what people are saying in comments and share this tweet someone commented- https://x.com/buccocapital/status/1828407633541296603 Most important part is about scaling laws and emergent properties. Essentially - AI is showing unexpectedly ""intelligent"" properties at higher compute powers (emergent properties) and these companies now believe that this will scale at even higher compute powers.

I asked both Gemini and ChatGPT a question - both just lie to my face. Then I confront them and they backtrack. If I don't know exactly what I am talking about - they are more dangerous than useless. They confidently give incorrect answers.But I do find it cool how I ""talk"" to a machine and they react kinda like a human.
