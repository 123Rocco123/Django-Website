But it’s not some small name that I predict will get huge in the future, it’s already big. I just predict it’ll be stable and good enough (given I have capital gains in the stock I don’t want to realize, because it had a good run in its early days).I find this game more fun to play on a short time horizon. On a long time horizon, I’ve come to realize even the biggest companies can fail. And you don’t know what ones those will be, but they include some of the biggest names in the history of corporate America. I decided that’s more risk than I was willing to accept, so a while ago I sold all my individual stocks (except Visa) and bought ETFs. Over a long enough time horizon, even the best in the business can’t beat the market.I only buy individual stocks now when I get bored or greedy, which aren’t good bases for making investment decisions.",0,0.539,POSITIVE,0.999
