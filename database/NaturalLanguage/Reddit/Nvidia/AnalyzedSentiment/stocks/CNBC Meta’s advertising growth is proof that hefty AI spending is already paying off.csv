,"This is a pretty long article, but I think it is an important read since it answers the key question ""Is anyone making significant money from AI right now?"" Clearly the answer is yes for Meta. For easier reading I tried to bold the parts the discuss AI specifically. Source: CNBC For investors who are skeptical of Meta’s massive spending on artificial intelligence and whether it will pay off anytime soon, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is urging them to look to the present. After the company’s better-than-expected second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, Zuckerberg and finance chief Susan Li rattled off all the ways that AI has helped the company grow faster than the competition in the digital advertising market, Meta’s core business. “The ways that it’s improving recommendations and helping people find better content, as well as making the advertising experiences more effective, I think there’s a lot of upside there,” Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. “Those are already products that are at scale. The AI work that we’re doing is going to improve that.” Meta reported revenue growth of 22% from a year earlier to $39.07 billion, with 98% of its sales coming from advertising, primarily on Facebook and Instagram. Its growth rate was double that of Google’s ad business, which saw sales increase 11% to $64.6 billion, Alphabet said in its earnings report last week. Meanwhile, Pinterest and Spotify, which are both significantly smaller than Meta, reported revenue growth of 21% and 20%, respectively, in their latest reports. As in previous quarters, Li said Meta’s advertising business benefited from online commerce, gaming and the media and entertainment sectors, and that ad growth continued to be strongest in the Asia-Pacific region. She said the company’s “improved ad performance” helped lift overall ad prices despite slowing growth in that region. Zuckerberg pointed to AI as the foundation behind Meta’s refreshed online advertising platform, which was battered after Apple introduced an iOS privacy update in 2021 that made it harder for social media companies to target users across the Internet. “They rebuilt their ad tech stack using AI and they changed their user interface and generated a lot more user engagement because of AI,” said Mark Mahaney, internet analyst at Evercore ISI, in an interview on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Wednesday. “It’s showing up in the revenue and the profits now,” said Mahaney, who recommends buying Meta shares. Meta shares popped 7% in extended trading after Wednesday’s earnings report, which included an uplifting forecast for the current quarter. Like the other mega-cap tech companies, Meta is spending billions of dollars on Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs), which are needed to train AI models and run hefty workloads. Some industry experts have questioned the outlays because so much of the investment is tied to expectations that generative AI — popularized by OpenAI’s ChatGPT — will lead to big revenue gains in the future. ‘Already seen a return’ Meta is showing that, while the bet is on major growth down the road, the company is reaping rewards today. “You’ve already seen a return with Meta over the last two years,” Mahaney said. Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research, agreed with Mahaney, telling CNBC that Meta has “really navigated some of the concerns and the storms” from a couple years ago and is “clearly integrating AI across their ecosystem extremely nicely.” Zino noted that Meta’s growth rates are “nicely outpacing those of its peers.” Meta isn’t finished spending big money on AI and the far-flung metaverse, which continues to lose billions of dollars each quarter. Li said that Meta expects “significant CapEx growth in 2025 as we invest to support our AI research and our product development efforts.” For 2024, Meta said it now expects capital expenditures in the range of $37 billion to $40 billion, lifting the low end of that range, which had been $35 billion. Li says investors should think of Meta’s AI strategy as a two-pronged approach, with “core AI” helping Meta improve its advertising platform and recommendation system, thus leading to more user engagement and ad performance that “have translated into revenue gains.” Generative AI is a longer-term bet. Li said that the company doesn’t “expect our Gen AI products to be a meaningful driver of revenue in ’24, but we do expect that they’re going to open up new revenue opportunities over time that will enable us to generate a solid return off of our investment.”",The usual suspects are already making money.

As a disclaimer, I own NVDA and TSM (substantial positions and recently added more on the pullback), and will ride out any swings between now and late August when NVDA reports, which better be a really great report or it will tank, but it probably will be great or everyone will be scrambling to find out where the spend went.Right now, investors are obviously getting skeptical about AI cap ex, which will eventually result in lower mag 7 cap ex, which will be really bad for semis, but that's a second derivative effect and the arms race definitely isn't ending right now. I'll seriously shave my top-tier semi positions when these cap ex numbers start dropping in a meaningful way or when LLM training/inference ASICs start eating NVDA's lunch. As far as I know, AVGO (just added to a meaningful buy-and-hold position) and TSM are the way for a non-accredited investor to play the eventual ASICs wave, but NVDA could also come out with their own ASICs.But right now, the megacap CEOs are really excited about AI and they have the money to spend on it. They still have good cash flow and can still spend big if they want to. I think LLMs and other applications of transformers will continue to get better, they'll be faster, smaller models will be better, and context windows will be larger before the LLMs start spitting out hallucinations and functionally break. With the right training techniques, which are still evolving, the transformer that LLMs is based on can remarkably improve on really overdetermined data, which breaks what I used to know about signals analysis and training old-school neural networks.I think we are going through a routine low-volume summer pullback with hedge funds piling into the previously lagging R2K, which makes momentum plays swing like crazy. But, hedge funds will be back, and they'll long the same positions they shorted months earlier, and then they'll short them again. It's fine for investors to hold the feet of megacaps to the fire, but that just brings their PE multiples closer to normal (for a tech stock).Other position disclaimers:Google (small LT buy-and-hold position, they are behind and will probably lose search market share but I won't bet against their data and proprietary tensor core iterations)*Microsoft (small long-held position)*Meta (no position due to longstanding antipathy plus I think they are behind with AI and the metaverse and they have more limited room to grow because 3.5 billion users is a lot, even if many of those are bots. I think they will outperform but won't be in the driver's seat. I still don't see how Zuck is going to monetize their open-source LLM models while Microsoft at least has a plan that may kick in when co-pilot improves and co-pilot subscriber numbers improve. I may be in the minority, but I think this will happen eventually, can't say when. I'm personally scared of AI Windows, but I think Microsoft will try to copy whatever Apple does, with more ads and less privacy, and make money.",1,0.525,0.972,NEGATIVE

The AI work that we’re doing is going to improve that.” Meta reported revenue growth of 22% from a year earlier to $39.07 billion, with 98% of its sales coming from advertising, primarily on Facebook and Instagram. Its growth rate was double that of Google’s ad business, which saw sales increase 11% to $64.6 billion, Alphabet said in its earnings report last week. Meanwhile, Pinterest and Spotify, which are both significantly smaller than Meta, reported revenue growth of 21% and 20%, respectively, in their latest reports. As in previous quarters, Li said Meta’s advertising business benefited from online commerce, gaming and the media and entertainment sectors, and that ad growth continued to be strongest in the Asia-Pacific region. She said the company’s “improved ad performance” helped lift overall ad prices despite slowing growth in that region. Zuckerberg pointed to AI as the foundation behind Meta’s refreshed online advertising platform, which was battered after Apple introduced an iOS privacy update in 2021 that made it harder for social media companies to target users across the Internet. “They rebuilt their ad tech stack using AI and they changed their user interface and generated a lot more user engagement because of AI,” said Mark Mahaney, internet analyst at Evercore ISI, in an interview on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Wednesday. “It’s showing up in the revenue and the profits now,” said Mahaney, who recommends buying Meta shares. Meta shares popped 7% in extended trading after Wednesday’s earnings report, which included an uplifting forecast for the current quarter. Like the other mega-cap tech companies, Meta is spending billions of dollars on Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs), which are needed to train AI models and run hefty workloads. Some industry experts have questioned the outlays because so much of the investment is tied to expectations that generative AI — popularized by OpenAI’s ChatGPT — will lead to big revenue gains in the future. ‘Already seen a return’ Meta is showing that, while the bet is on major growth down the road, the company is reaping rewards today. “You’ve already seen a return with Meta over the last two years,” Mahaney said. Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research, agreed with Mahaney, telling CNBC that Meta has “really navigated some of the concerns and the storms” from a couple years ago and is “clearly integrating AI across their ecosystem extremely nicely.” Zino noted that Meta’s growth rates are “nicely outpacing those of its peers.” Meta isn’t finished spending big money on AI and the far-flung metaverse, which continues to lose billions of dollars each quarter. Li said that Meta expects “significant CapEx growth in 2025 as we invest to support our AI research and our product development efforts.” For 2024, Meta said it now expects capital expenditures in the range of $37 billion to $40 billion, lifting the low end of that range, which had been $35 billion. Li says investors should think of Meta’s AI strategy as a two-pronged approach, with “core AI” helping Meta improve its advertising platform and recommendation system, thus leading to more user engagement and ad performance that “have translated into revenue gains.” Generative AI is a longer-term bet. Li said that the company doesn’t “expect our Gen AI products to be a meaningful driver of revenue in ’24, but we do expect that they’re going to open up new revenue opportunities over time that will enable us to generate a solid return off of our investment.”","and will ride out any swings between now and late August when NVDA reports, which better be a really great report or it will tankDon't expect the same growth numbers in Aug.

For me to buy a stock with a high PE, it better have higher revenues and higher earnings every quarter and those numbers better have a strong correlation to each other and to EPS (those boxes are checked). I like to look at quarterly revenue and EBDITA. I have plugged in the numbers, and I would argue that these numbers are both statistically linear. The revenue numbers do a fit a parabolic fit better than a linear fit, hinting at slowing revenue growth. But, the parabolic fit will always be better than the linear fit, whether or not it has meaning, and quarterly earnings reports make for very sparse data. I'm expecting roughly linear but moderating revenue and EPS growth and will unload if there is a big surprise to the downside. With linear EPS growth for the next year out, earnings for the next year would be 2-3 times higher, making the forward PE, which ignores analyst estimates, very reasonable. Growth will probably moderate because of supply chain constraints and moderation in demand. But, Nvidia doesn't need a PE close between 20 and 30 a year out at these prices because high-growth market leaders always command a PE premium.But, it's very plausible that revenue growth is slowing because TSM's production capacity is a bottleneck and it takes a long time to build new fabs, which TSM is doing. However, Nvidia has historically kept its margins very high when there is strong demand. I think the pertinent historical examples are the last bitcoin bubble pre-ASICs and Cisco around its nose-bleed peak with a PE over 200. During the crypt0 bubble Nvidia absolutely crushed it while reddit gamers had daily tantrums about Nvidia charging unfair prices for their GPUs. That lasted until ASICs made it unprofitable to mine with an all-purpose GPU, crypt0 started crashing and Nvidia crashed. I'm watching Mag 7 cap ex because Cisco collapsed roughly the month after its biggest customers (like Worldcom, AT&T, AOL, Qwest, and Sprint) started dramatically cutting their cap ex. The now bankrupt Worldcom was an outright criminal fraud that was buying Cisco routers to pretend that they were making money to pump their share prices. So I'm worried about demand, I'm worried about ASICs, respectively thinking about Cisco and the last crypt0 bubble. The main reason I bought more AVGO because its price is down and because OpenAI is building a new secret chip with Broadcom, which is almost certainly a new ASIC chip that will rely on Broadcom and TSM. Also, broadcom should benefit from its auto and manufacturing chips and cell phone sales will probably pick up if rates go down and it's a given that they will go down.But, major risks are that the economy is definitely slowing by almost any metric and the Fed is always late with their rate moves, with their backward-looking data analysis, and what's bad for the economy is bad for everyone. Also, from now to October is historically a very bad time for semis and Wall Street knows it. Also, we know that if investors revolt on spend, CEOs like Zuck will dramatically cut back on cap ex, like he did after the Metaverse crash. I think if one megacap CEO cuts back on GPU spend, they all will, as I feel they are defensively spending to not get left behind, so the script can flip and growth can turn into misses in a hurry. Finally, I feel that most semi and software stocks are overvalued and catching AI tailwinds for no reason and this will hurt the few stocks with good performance, because hedge algos will work to keep correlated pairs of stocks correlated. The conflict between Iran and Israel could blow up in the near future. Also, the performance of bigger and bigger transformers could hit a wall, but I don't think there's evidence of that yet. I don't think humans are special and that there are intrinsic limits about what humans can do and future AI can't. However, better GPUs will someday be locked down even in the U.S., as a national security issue.But, I have a long-term horizon, and the megacaps that are pumping money into NVDA haven't cut back on cap ex yet. Nadela says there is still increasing cloud demand and the probability that he is telling truth is greater than the probability that he is lying. I can afford to be wrong about the future and I'll still pay a lot of taxes when I exit.",3,0.547,1.0,NEGATIVE

Li said that Meta expects “significant CapEx growth in 2025 as we invest to support our AI research and our product development efforts.” For 2024, Meta said it now expects capital expenditures in the range of $37 billion to $40 billion, lifting the low end of that range, which had been $35 billion. Li says investors should think of Meta’s AI strategy as a two-pronged approach, with “core AI” helping Meta improve its advertising platform and recommendation system, thus leading to more user engagement and ad performance that “have translated into revenue gains.” Generative AI is a longer-term bet. Li said that the company doesn’t “expect our Gen AI products to be a meaningful driver of revenue in ’24, but we do expect that they’re going to open up new revenue opportunities over time that will enable us to generate a solid return off of our investment.”","Here's a link not behind a paywall.Let me get this straight; after linear revenue increases from Q1 FY 2021 ($3.08B) to Q1 FY 2023 ($8.29B), followed by two quarter of revenue decline to $5.93B in Q3 FY 2023 before returning to linear revenue increase uninterrupted until the present (Q1 FY 2025 - $26.04B) and achieving unprecedented net margin of 57% NVDA is supposed to pull back because it's in a ""cycle""?If revenue hadn't lagged 2022-2023 the stock wouldn't have declined, so growth would have been more steady and thus less profound this past year certainly (obviously), but the valuation wouldn't be less stratospheric at these revenue and margin numbers.You are really grasping at straws. There's no pattern here to draw any conclusions and nothing you've said indicates anything about what Aug numbers will look like. The ebbs and flows of how it got from ~8$B to ~$26B explain the movement of the stock during that time period, but say little of the future; as opposed to revenue at companies like TSM, META, and AMD.

,"This is a pretty long article, but I think it is an important read since it answers the key question ""Is anyone making significant money from AI right now?"" Clearly the answer is yes for Meta. For easier reading I tried to bold the parts the discuss AI specifically. Source: CNBC For investors who are skeptical of Meta’s massive spending on artificial intelligence and whether it will pay off anytime soon, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is urging them to look to the present. After the company’s better-than-expected second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, Zuckerberg and finance chief Susan Li rattled off all the ways that AI has helped the company grow faster than the competition in the digital advertising market, Meta’s core business. “The ways that it’s improving recommendations and helping people find better content, as well as making the advertising experiences more effective, I think there’s a lot of upside there,” Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. “Those are already products that are at scale. The AI work that we’re doing is going to improve that.” Meta reported revenue growth of 22% from a year earlier to $39.07 billion, with 98% of its sales coming from advertising, primarily on Facebook and Instagram. Its growth rate was double that of Google’s ad business, which saw sales increase 11% to $64.6 billion, Alphabet said in its earnings report last week. Meanwhile, Pinterest and Spotify, which are both significantly smaller than Meta, reported revenue growth of 21% and 20%, respectively, in their latest reports. As in previous quarters, Li said Meta’s advertising business benefited from online commerce, gaming and the media and entertainment sectors, and that ad growth continued to be strongest in the Asia-Pacific region. She said the company’s “improved ad performance” helped lift overall ad prices despite slowing growth in that region. Zuckerberg pointed to AI as the foundation behind Meta’s refreshed online advertising platform, which was battered after Apple introduced an iOS privacy update in 2021 that made it harder for social media companies to target users across the Internet. “They rebuilt their ad tech stack using AI and they changed their user interface and generated a lot more user engagement because of AI,” said Mark Mahaney, internet analyst at Evercore ISI, in an interview on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Wednesday. “It’s showing up in the revenue and the profits now,” said Mahaney, who recommends buying Meta shares. Meta shares popped 7% in extended trading after Wednesday’s earnings report, which included an uplifting forecast for the current quarter. Like the other mega-cap tech companies, Meta is spending billions of dollars on Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs), which are needed to train AI models and run hefty workloads.

There is a good chance that China will flirt with blockading Taiwan after a manufactured controversy regarding some politicians statement in the 2-5 years from now. I think Xi Xinping wants an invasion of Taiwan to be his legacy, but I hope his peers will talk him out of tanking China's economy even more. If Blackwell has persistent water-cooling leak issues, that could be a problem for many years. Blackwell yields could be much lower than expected, since joining chips is a new technology. A president could ban GPUs that are more powerful than a threshold out of fear of AI. Policy could be changed to tax cloud providers unless they use green energy, which I would support. Companies could hit the energy bottleneck, so I bought Dominion energy (since the largest server farm concetration is in Northern Virginia) and NEE to get a little bit of a dividend barbel. The Supreme Court could rule that LLMs are liable for copyright infringement and that all the AI companies owe tons of money to everyone else. At some point, the first globally damaging AI virus will hit and new laws will be passed.I think calling peaks and bottoms is a losing game and trying to predict a peak years out is even more of a losing game. But, if I had to guess, I think the peak will come when we see dot-com/last crypt0 bubble levels of hype in a lower interest rate environment. You'll see a ton of startup IPOs/SPACs with no earnings or plans for earnings that investors will lose a lot of money on. You will see ads pumping and shilling two-bit money-losing AI companies on TV while insiders sell the dominant portions of their stakes. NVDA's PE might go substantially north of 100, then LLM ASICs could be produced at scale. Then, my friends and relatives that ignored my advice to buy years ago will ask if now is a good time to make a big investment, and I'll know it's over and it's time to research boring stocks with stable dividends. A massive crash will happen, which will go way too far on the downside. Just randomly guessing, this is not a prediction, July 30th 2026 could be a peak, plus or minus a year. But, AI is here to stay until the next EMP and it will continue to improve. Modern transformers were created in June of 2017, GPT3 came out in November of 2022, commensurate with the start of NVDA's rally, things are still getting better. Cloud is still growing at all of the major providers. The AI spend is on GPUs and it can take 5-10 to get a return out of a GPU or cluster, so it isn't reasonable to expect returns on cloud compute to equal the expense right now. It'll be fun until it gets scary!",3,0.53,1.0,NEGATIVE

Like the other mega-cap tech companies, Meta is spending billions of dollars on Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs), which are needed to train AI models and run hefty workloads. Some industry experts have questioned the outlays because so much of the investment is tied to expectations that generative AI — popularized by OpenAI’s ChatGPT — will lead to big revenue gains in the future. ‘Already seen a return’ Meta is showing that, while the bet is on major growth down the road, the company is reaping rewards today. “You’ve already seen a return with Meta over the last two years,” Mahaney said. Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research, agreed with Mahaney, telling CNBC that Meta has “really navigated some of the concerns and the storms” from a couple years ago and is “clearly integrating AI across their ecosystem extremely nicely.” Zino noted that Meta’s growth rates are “nicely outpacing those of its peers.” Meta isn’t finished spending big money on AI and the far-flung metaverse, which continues to lose billions of dollars each quarter. Li said that Meta expects “significant CapEx growth in 2025 as we invest to support our AI research and our product development efforts.” For 2024, Meta said it now expects capital expenditures in the range of $37 billion to $40 billion, lifting the low end of that range, which had been $35 billion. Li says investors should think of Meta’s AI strategy as a two-pronged approach, with “core AI” helping Meta improve its advertising platform and recommendation system, thus leading to more user engagement and ad performance that “have translated into revenue gains.” Generative AI is a longer-term bet.

Source: CNBC For investors who are skeptical of Meta’s massive spending on artificial intelligence and whether it will pay off anytime soon, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is urging them to look to the present. After the company’s better-than-expected second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, Zuckerberg and finance chief Susan Li rattled off all the ways that AI has helped the company grow faster than the competition in the digital advertising market, Meta’s core business. “The ways that it’s improving recommendations and helping people find better content, as well as making the advertising experiences more effective, I think there’s a lot of upside there,” Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. “Those are already products that are at scale. The AI work that we’re doing is going to improve that.” Meta reported revenue growth of 22% from a year earlier to $39.07 billion, with 98% of its sales coming from advertising, primarily on Facebook and Instagram. Its growth rate was double that of Google’s ad business, which saw sales increase 11% to $64.6 billion, Alphabet said in its earnings report last week. Meanwhile, Pinterest and Spotify, which are both significantly smaller than Meta, reported revenue growth of 21% and 20%, respectively, in their latest reports. As in previous quarters, Li said Meta’s advertising business benefited from online commerce, gaming and the media and entertainment sectors, and that ad growth continued to be strongest in the Asia-Pacific region. She said the company’s “improved ad performance” helped lift overall ad prices despite slowing growth in that region.

After the company’s better-than-expected second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, Zuckerberg and finance chief Susan Li rattled off all the ways that AI has helped the company grow faster than the competition in the digital advertising market, Meta’s core business. “The ways that it’s improving recommendations and helping people find better content, as well as making the advertising experiences more effective, I think there’s a lot of upside there,” Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. “Those are already products that are at scale. The AI work that we’re doing is going to improve that.” Meta reported revenue growth of 22% from a year earlier to $39.07 billion, with 98% of its sales coming from advertising, primarily on Facebook and Instagram. Its growth rate was double that of Google’s ad business, which saw sales increase 11% to $64.6 billion, Alphabet said in its earnings report last week. Meanwhile, Pinterest and Spotify, which are both significantly smaller than Meta, reported revenue growth of 21% and 20%, respectively, in their latest reports. As in previous quarters, Li said Meta’s advertising business benefited from online commerce, gaming and the media and entertainment sectors, and that ad growth continued to be strongest in the Asia-Pacific region. She said the company’s “improved ad performance” helped lift overall ad prices despite slowing growth in that region. Zuckerberg pointed to AI as the foundation behind Meta’s refreshed online advertising platform, which was battered after Apple introduced an iOS privacy update in 2021 that made it harder for social media companies to target users across the Internet. “They rebuilt their ad tech stack using AI and they changed their user interface and generated a lot more user engagement because of AI,” said Mark Mahaney, internet analyst at Evercore ISI, in an interview on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Wednesday. “It’s showing up in the revenue and the profits now,” said Mahaney, who recommends buying Meta shares. Meta shares popped 7% in extended trading after Wednesday’s earnings report, which included an uplifting forecast for the current quarter. Like the other mega-cap tech companies, Meta is spending billions of dollars on Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs), which are needed to train AI models and run hefty workloads. Some industry experts have questioned the outlays because so much of the investment is tied to expectations that generative AI — popularized by OpenAI’s ChatGPT — will lead to big revenue gains in the future. ‘Already seen a return’ Meta is showing that, while the bet is on major growth down the road, the company is reaping rewards today. “You’ve already seen a return with Meta over the last two years,” Mahaney said. Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research, agreed with Mahaney, telling CNBC that Meta has “really navigated some of the concerns and the storms” from a couple years ago and is “clearly integrating AI across their ecosystem extremely nicely.” Zino noted that Meta’s growth rates are “nicely outpacing those of its peers.” Meta isn’t finished spending big money on AI and the far-flung metaverse, which continues to lose billions of dollars each quarter. Li said that Meta expects “significant CapEx growth in 2025 as we invest to support our AI research and our product development efforts.” For 2024, Meta said it now expects capital expenditures in the range of $37 billion to $40 billion, lifting the low end of that range, which had been $35 billion. Li says investors should think of Meta’s AI strategy as a two-pronged approach, with “core AI” helping Meta improve its advertising platform and recommendation system, thus leading to more user engagement and ad performance that “have translated into revenue gains.” Generative AI is a longer-term bet. Li said that the company doesn’t “expect our Gen AI products to be a meaningful driver of revenue in ’24, but we do expect that they’re going to open up new revenue opportunities over time that will enable us to generate a solid return off of our investment.”",Why are you suddenly talking about LLMs?

Source: CNBC For investors who are skeptical of Meta’s massive spending on artificial intelligence and whether it will pay off anytime soon, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is urging them to look to the present. After the company’s better-than-expected second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, Zuckerberg and finance chief Susan Li rattled off all the ways that AI has helped the company grow faster than the competition in the digital advertising market, Meta’s core business. “The ways that it’s improving recommendations and helping people find better content, as well as making the advertising experiences more effective, I think there’s a lot of upside there,” Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. “Those are already products that are at scale. The AI work that we’re doing is going to improve that.” Meta reported revenue growth of 22% from a year earlier to $39.07 billion, with 98% of its sales coming from advertising, primarily on Facebook and Instagram. Its growth rate was double that of Google’s ad business, which saw sales increase 11% to $64.6 billion, Alphabet said in its earnings report last week. Meanwhile, Pinterest and Spotify, which are both significantly smaller than Meta, reported revenue growth of 21% and 20%, respectively, in their latest reports. As in previous quarters, Li said Meta’s advertising business benefited from online commerce, gaming and the media and entertainment sectors, and that ad growth continued to be strongest in the Asia-Pacific region. She said the company’s “improved ad performance” helped lift overall ad prices despite slowing growth in that region. Zuckerberg pointed to AI as the foundation behind Meta’s refreshed online advertising platform, which was battered after Apple introduced an iOS privacy update in 2021 that made it harder for social media companies to target users across the Internet. “They rebuilt their ad tech stack using AI and they changed their user interface and generated a lot more user engagement because of AI,” said Mark Mahaney, internet analyst at Evercore ISI, in an interview on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Wednesday. “It’s showing up in the revenue and the profits now,” said Mahaney, who recommends buying Meta shares. Meta shares popped 7% in extended trading after Wednesday’s earnings report, which included an uplifting forecast for the current quarter. Like the other mega-cap tech companies, Meta is spending billions of dollars on Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs), which are needed to train AI models and run hefty workloads. Some industry experts have questioned the outlays because so much of the investment is tied to expectations that generative AI — popularized by OpenAI’s ChatGPT — will lead to big revenue gains in the future. ‘Already seen a return’ Meta is showing that, while the bet is on major growth down the road, the company is reaping rewards today. “You’ve already seen a return with Meta over the last two years,” Mahaney said. Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research, agreed with Mahaney, telling CNBC that Meta has “really navigated some of the concerns and the storms” from a couple years ago and is “clearly integrating AI across their ecosystem extremely nicely.” Zino noted that Meta’s growth rates are “nicely outpacing those of its peers.” Meta isn’t finished spending big money on AI and the far-flung metaverse, which continues to lose billions of dollars each quarter.

With the advanced natural language understanding capabilities of Bard, this system would offer a new layer of contextualisation based on past user behaviour and demographic information. Imagine a CTA that adapts in real time to subtle shifts in consumer intent.

For easier reading I tried to bold the parts the discuss AI specifically. Source: CNBC For investors who are skeptical of Meta’s massive spending on artificial intelligence and whether it will pay off anytime soon, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is urging them to look to the present. After the company’s better-than-expected second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, Zuckerberg and finance chief Susan Li rattled off all the ways that AI has helped the company grow faster than the competition in the digital advertising market, Meta’s core business. “The ways that it’s improving recommendations and helping people find better content, as well as making the advertising experiences more effective, I think there’s a lot of upside there,” Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. “Those are already products that are at scale. The AI work that we’re doing is going to improve that.” Meta reported revenue growth of 22% from a year earlier to $39.07 billion, with 98% of its sales coming from advertising, primarily on Facebook and Instagram. Its growth rate was double that of Google’s ad business, which saw sales increase 11% to $64.6 billion, Alphabet said in its earnings report last week. Meanwhile, Pinterest and Spotify, which are both significantly smaller than Meta, reported revenue growth of 21% and 20%, respectively, in their latest reports. As in previous quarters, Li said Meta’s advertising business benefited from online commerce, gaming and the media and entertainment sectors, and that ad growth continued to be strongest in the Asia-Pacific region. She said the company’s “improved ad performance” helped lift overall ad prices despite slowing growth in that region. Zuckerberg pointed to AI as the foundation behind Meta’s refreshed online advertising platform, which was battered after Apple introduced an iOS privacy update in 2021 that made it harder for social media companies to target users across the Internet. “They rebuilt their ad tech stack using AI and they changed their user interface and generated a lot more user engagement because of AI,” said Mark Mahaney, internet analyst at Evercore ISI, in an interview on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Wednesday. “It’s showing up in the revenue and the profits now,” said Mahaney, who recommends buying Meta shares. Meta shares popped 7% in extended trading after Wednesday’s earnings report, which included an uplifting forecast for the current quarter.

As in previous quarters, Li said Meta’s advertising business benefited from online commerce, gaming and the media and entertainment sectors, and that ad growth continued to be strongest in the Asia-Pacific region. She said the company’s “improved ad performance” helped lift overall ad prices despite slowing growth in that region. Zuckerberg pointed to AI as the foundation behind Meta’s refreshed online advertising platform, which was battered after Apple introduced an iOS privacy update in 2021 that made it harder for social media companies to target users across the Internet. “They rebuilt their ad tech stack using AI and they changed their user interface and generated a lot more user engagement because of AI,” said Mark Mahaney, internet analyst at Evercore ISI, in an interview on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Wednesday. “It’s showing up in the revenue and the profits now,” said Mahaney, who recommends buying Meta shares. Meta shares popped 7% in extended trading after Wednesday’s earnings report, which included an uplifting forecast for the current quarter. Like the other mega-cap tech companies, Meta is spending billions of dollars on Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs), which are needed to train AI models and run hefty workloads. Some industry experts have questioned the outlays because so much of the investment is tied to expectations that generative AI — popularized by OpenAI’s ChatGPT — will lead to big revenue gains in the future. ‘Already seen a return’ Meta is showing that, while the bet is on major growth down the road, the company is reaping rewards today. “You’ve already seen a return with Meta over the last two years,” Mahaney said. Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research, agreed with Mahaney, telling CNBC that Meta has “really navigated some of the concerns and the storms” from a couple years ago and is “clearly integrating AI across their ecosystem extremely nicely.” Zino noted that Meta’s growth rates are “nicely outpacing those of its peers.” Meta isn’t finished spending big money on AI and the far-flung metaverse, which continues to lose billions of dollars each quarter. Li said that Meta expects “significant CapEx growth in 2025 as we invest to support our AI research and our product development efforts.” For 2024, Meta said it now expects capital expenditures in the range of $37 billion to $40 billion, lifting the low end of that range, which had been $35 billion. Li says investors should think of Meta’s AI strategy as a two-pronged approach, with “core AI” helping Meta improve its advertising platform and recommendation system, thus leading to more user engagement and ad performance that “have translated into revenue gains.” Generative AI is a longer-term bet. Li said that the company doesn’t “expect our Gen AI products to be a meaningful driver of revenue in ’24, but we do expect that they’re going to open up new revenue opportunities over time that will enable us to generate a solid return off of our investment.”","IG Reels is indeed catching up with TikTok. Except video advertisements are hard to monetize and have been deprioritized at FB as a result.Video recommendations are also fundamentally different from text and image recommendations which is the traditional fb feed.Twitter is just text and very celebrity oriented.

Source: CNBC For investors who are skeptical of Meta’s massive spending on artificial intelligence and whether it will pay off anytime soon, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is urging them to look to the present. After the company’s better-than-expected second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, Zuckerberg and finance chief Susan Li rattled off all the ways that AI has helped the company grow faster than the competition in the digital advertising market, Meta’s core business. “The ways that it’s improving recommendations and helping people find better content, as well as making the advertising experiences more effective, I think there’s a lot of upside there,” Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. “Those are already products that are at scale. The AI work that we’re doing is going to improve that.” Meta reported revenue growth of 22% from a year earlier to $39.07 billion, with 98% of its sales coming from advertising, primarily on Facebook and Instagram. Its growth rate was double that of Google’s ad business, which saw sales increase 11% to $64.6 billion, Alphabet said in its earnings report last week. Meanwhile, Pinterest and Spotify, which are both significantly smaller than Meta, reported revenue growth of 21% and 20%, respectively, in their latest reports. As in previous quarters, Li said Meta’s advertising business benefited from online commerce, gaming and the media and entertainment sectors, and that ad growth continued to be strongest in the Asia-Pacific region. She said the company’s “improved ad performance” helped lift overall ad prices despite slowing growth in that region. Zuckerberg pointed to AI as the foundation behind Meta’s refreshed online advertising platform, which was battered after Apple introduced an iOS privacy update in 2021 that made it harder for social media companies to target users across the Internet. “They rebuilt their ad tech stack using AI and they changed their user interface and generated a lot more user engagement because of AI,” said Mark Mahaney, internet analyst at Evercore ISI, in an interview on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Wednesday. “It’s showing up in the revenue and the profits now,” said Mahaney, who recommends buying Meta shares. Meta shares popped 7% in extended trading after Wednesday’s earnings report, which included an uplifting forecast for the current quarter. Like the other mega-cap tech companies, Meta is spending billions of dollars on Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs), which are needed to train AI models and run hefty workloads. Some industry experts have questioned the outlays because so much of the investment is tied to expectations that generative AI — popularized by OpenAI’s ChatGPT — will lead to big revenue gains in the future. ‘Already seen a return’ Meta is showing that, while the bet is on major growth down the road, the company is reaping rewards today. “You’ve already seen a return with Meta over the last two years,” Mahaney said. Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research, agreed with Mahaney, telling CNBC that Meta has “really navigated some of the concerns and the storms” from a couple years ago and is “clearly integrating AI across their ecosystem extremely nicely.” Zino noted that Meta’s growth rates are “nicely outpacing those of its peers.” Meta isn’t finished spending big money on AI and the far-flung metaverse, which continues to lose billions of dollars each quarter. Li said that Meta expects “significant CapEx growth in 2025 as we invest to support our AI research and our product development efforts.” For 2024, Meta said it now expects capital expenditures in the range of $37 billion to $40 billion, lifting the low end of that range, which had been $35 billion. Li says investors should think of Meta’s AI strategy as a two-pronged approach, with “core AI” helping Meta improve its advertising platform and recommendation system, thus leading to more user engagement and ad performance that “have translated into revenue gains.” Generative AI is a longer-term bet. Li said that the company doesn’t “expect our Gen AI products to be a meaningful driver of revenue in ’24, but we do expect that they’re going to open up new revenue opportunities over time that will enable us to generate a solid return off of our investment.”",You’re using a movie to make judgements on a CEO instead of looking at the income statement and realizing that Meta is a money printing machine?

,"This is a pretty long article, but I think it is an important read since it answers the key question ""Is anyone making significant money from AI right now?"" Clearly the answer is yes for Meta. For easier reading I tried to bold the parts the discuss AI specifically. Source: CNBC For investors who are skeptical of Meta’s massive spending on artificial intelligence and whether it will pay off anytime soon, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is urging them to look to the present. After the company’s better-than-expected second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, Zuckerberg and finance chief Susan Li rattled off all the ways that AI has helped the company grow faster than the competition in the digital advertising market, Meta’s core business. “The ways that it’s improving recommendations and helping people find better content, as well as making the advertising experiences more effective, I think there’s a lot of upside there,” Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. “Those are already products that are at scale. The AI work that we’re doing is going to improve that.” Meta reported revenue growth of 22% from a year earlier to $39.07 billion, with 98% of its sales coming from advertising, primarily on Facebook and Instagram. Its growth rate was double that of Google’s ad business, which saw sales increase 11% to $64.6 billion, Alphabet said in its earnings report last week. Meanwhile, Pinterest and Spotify, which are both significantly smaller than Meta, reported revenue growth of 21% and 20%, respectively, in their latest reports. As in previous quarters, Li said Meta’s advertising business benefited from online commerce, gaming and the media and entertainment sectors, and that ad growth continued to be strongest in the Asia-Pacific region. She said the company’s “improved ad performance” helped lift overall ad prices despite slowing growth in that region. Zuckerberg pointed to AI as the foundation behind Meta’s refreshed online advertising platform, which was battered after Apple introduced an iOS privacy update in 2021 that made it harder for social media companies to target users across the Internet. “They rebuilt their ad tech stack using AI and they changed their user interface and generated a lot more user engagement because of AI,” said Mark Mahaney, internet analyst at Evercore ISI, in an interview on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Wednesday. “It’s showing up in the revenue and the profits now,” said Mahaney, who recommends buying Meta shares. Meta shares popped 7% in extended trading after Wednesday’s earnings report, which included an uplifting forecast for the current quarter. Like the other mega-cap tech companies, Meta is spending billions of dollars on Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs), which are needed to train AI models and run hefty workloads.

For easier reading I tried to bold the parts the discuss AI specifically. Source: CNBC For investors who are skeptical of Meta’s massive spending on artificial intelligence and whether it will pay off anytime soon, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is urging them to look to the present. After the company’s better-than-expected second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, Zuckerberg and finance chief Susan Li rattled off all the ways that AI has helped the company grow faster than the competition in the digital advertising market, Meta’s core business. “The ways that it’s improving recommendations and helping people find better content, as well as making the advertising experiences more effective, I think there’s a lot of upside there,” Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. “Those are already products that are at scale. The AI work that we’re doing is going to improve that.” Meta reported revenue growth of 22% from a year earlier to $39.07 billion, with 98% of its sales coming from advertising, primarily on Facebook and Instagram. Its growth rate was double that of Google’s ad business, which saw sales increase 11% to $64.6 billion, Alphabet said in its earnings report last week. Meanwhile, Pinterest and Spotify, which are both significantly smaller than Meta, reported revenue growth of 21% and 20%, respectively, in their latest reports. As in previous quarters, Li said Meta’s advertising business benefited from online commerce, gaming and the media and entertainment sectors, and that ad growth continued to be strongest in the Asia-Pacific region. She said the company’s “improved ad performance” helped lift overall ad prices despite slowing growth in that region. Zuckerberg pointed to AI as the foundation behind Meta’s refreshed online advertising platform, which was battered after Apple introduced an iOS privacy update in 2021 that made it harder for social media companies to target users across the Internet. “They rebuilt their ad tech stack using AI and they changed their user interface and generated a lot more user engagement because of AI,” said Mark Mahaney, internet analyst at Evercore ISI, in an interview on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Wednesday. “It’s showing up in the revenue and the profits now,” said Mahaney, who recommends buying Meta shares. Meta shares popped 7% in extended trading after Wednesday’s earnings report, which included an uplifting forecast for the current quarter. Like the other mega-cap tech companies, Meta is spending billions of dollars on Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs), which are needed to train AI models and run hefty workloads. Some industry experts have questioned the outlays because so much of the investment is tied to expectations that generative AI — popularized by OpenAI’s ChatGPT — will lead to big revenue gains in the future. ‘Already seen a return’ Meta is showing that, while the bet is on major growth down the road, the company is reaping rewards today. “You’ve already seen a return with Meta over the last two years,” Mahaney said. Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research, agreed with Mahaney, telling CNBC that Meta has “really navigated some of the concerns and the storms” from a couple years ago and is “clearly integrating AI across their ecosystem extremely nicely.” Zino noted that Meta’s growth rates are “nicely outpacing those of its peers.” Meta isn’t finished spending big money on AI and the far-flung metaverse, which continues to lose billions of dollars each quarter. Li said that Meta expects “significant CapEx growth in 2025 as we invest to support our AI research and our product development efforts.” For 2024, Meta said it now expects capital expenditures in the range of $37 billion to $40 billion, lifting the low end of that range, which had been $35 billion. Li says investors should think of Meta’s AI strategy as a two-pronged approach, with “core AI” helping Meta improve its advertising platform and recommendation system, thus leading to more user engagement and ad performance that “have translated into revenue gains.” Generative AI is a longer-term bet. Li said that the company doesn’t “expect our Gen AI products to be a meaningful driver of revenue in ’24, but we do expect that they’re going to open up new revenue opportunities over time that will enable us to generate a solid return off of our investment.”","If you're just talking about random display ads, then that makes sense. But did you study targeted ads where the social platform is using incredible amounts of signals to detect demographics, browsing history, intent, mood, etc?For a period FB ads were so easy to make money with. It was literally so good at finding people to buy your products. Then Apple and Google crippled FB by taking away major tracking capabilities. The big battle now is whether FB can use AI to overcome that roadblock. It seems like based on the recent profits they are making decent progress.",3,0.527,1.0,NEGATIVE

Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research, agreed with Mahaney, telling CNBC that Meta has “really navigated some of the concerns and the storms” from a couple years ago and is “clearly integrating AI across their ecosystem extremely nicely.” Zino noted that Meta’s growth rates are “nicely outpacing those of its peers.” Meta isn’t finished spending big money on AI and the far-flung metaverse, which continues to lose billions of dollars each quarter. Li said that Meta expects “significant CapEx growth in 2025 as we invest to support our AI research and our product development efforts.” For 2024, Meta said it now expects capital expenditures in the range of $37 billion to $40 billion, lifting the low end of that range, which had been $35 billion. Li says investors should think of Meta’s AI strategy as a two-pronged approach, with “core AI” helping Meta improve its advertising platform and recommendation system, thus leading to more user engagement and ad performance that “have translated into revenue gains.” Generative AI is a longer-term bet. Li said that the company doesn’t “expect our Gen AI products to be a meaningful driver of revenue in ’24, but we do expect that they’re going to open up new revenue opportunities over time that will enable us to generate a solid return off of our investment.”","LOL, damn I needed that :)",1,0.498,1.0,POSITIVE
,"This is a pretty long article, but I think it is an important read since it answers the key question ""Is anyone making significant money from AI right now?"" Clearly the answer is yes for Meta. For easier reading I tried to bold the parts the discuss AI specifically. Source: CNBC For investors who are skeptical of Meta’s massive spending on artificial intelligence and whether it will pay off anytime soon, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is urging them to look to the present. After the company’s better-than-expected second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, Zuckerberg and finance chief Susan Li rattled off all the ways that AI has helped the company grow faster than the competition in the digital advertising market, Meta’s core business. “The ways that it’s improving recommendations and helping people find better content, as well as making the advertising experiences more effective, I think there’s a lot of upside there,” Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. “Those are already products that are at scale. The AI work that we’re doing is going to improve that.” Meta reported revenue growth of 22% from a year earlier to $39.07 billion, with 98% of its sales coming from advertising, primarily on Facebook and Instagram. Its growth rate was double that of Google’s ad business, which saw sales increase 11% to $64.6 billion, Alphabet said in its earnings report last week. Meanwhile, Pinterest and Spotify, which are both significantly smaller than Meta, reported revenue growth of 21% and 20%, respectively, in their latest reports. As in previous quarters, Li said Meta’s advertising business benefited from online commerce, gaming and the media and entertainment sectors, and that ad growth continued to be strongest in the Asia-Pacific region. She said the company’s “improved ad performance” helped lift overall ad prices despite slowing growth in that region. Zuckerberg pointed to AI as the foundation behind Meta’s refreshed online advertising platform, which was battered after Apple introduced an iOS privacy update in 2021 that made it harder for social media companies to target users across the Internet. “They rebuilt their ad tech stack using AI and they changed their user interface and generated a lot more user engagement because of AI,” said Mark Mahaney, internet analyst at Evercore ISI, in an interview on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Wednesday. “It’s showing up in the revenue and the profits now,” said Mahaney, who recommends buying Meta shares. Meta shares popped 7% in extended trading after Wednesday’s earnings report, which included an uplifting forecast for the current quarter.
