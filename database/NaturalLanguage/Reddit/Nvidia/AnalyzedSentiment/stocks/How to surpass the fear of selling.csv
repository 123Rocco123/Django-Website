,"Long story short: I have some unrealised gains on stocks that I bought time ago (AMAT and ASML). I was multiple times on the verge of selling (totally or partially) to realise gains that I could invest in another opportunity with better potential. However, every time one of these opportunities came up, I ended up always retracting and not doing so, because I didn’t want to “give-up” to the long-term perspective I committed when I started in this. Sadly, with opportunities I mean Meta falling like crazy 1.5 years ago for the overreaction to the decrease in user registrations, Nvidia at 200 (before split), or Netflix also dropping to 180 in mid-2022. Recently, I was about to do the same to buy a chunk of TSLA. But fear always gets me. I know, everything is about risk tolerance. Maybe I am not made for this, who knows. However, I would be happy to know your opinion about this. I really want to take the chance if I believe that is the right choice. Any state of mind that helps you clicking in the sell button? I’m just tired of missing opportunities just for being afraid. Thanks!","I try to remember my core investment goals: 1. Make money and 2. Don’t lose money. If you sell at a profit, you meet both goals. I find comfort in that. Yes it’s frustrating to take a profit and think about how much more you could have made, but that’s also how you can fall into a gambling mindset and lose sight of your risk tolerance",0,0.527,0.996,POSITIVE

But leave a little bit in there. If the stock drops you go phew, well I avoided that catastrophe. If the stock rallies, you can cheer with everyone else and you don't have FOMO.Option 2: Only take back your initial investment.Answer to your question:The easiest and best way to avoid all this is to start small. Issue is that a lot of people buy too much in the beginning. Then when the stock starts dropping they start freaking out. If you start small, you have 3 options. If it does well, great. If it drops you can choose to sell with no sweat or if you feel conviction you can add a bit more. Or you can hold to see what happens. But if you buy in too big in the beginning you can't sleep well.",0,0.538,0.988,NEGATIVE

I was 45% portfolio in Nvidia (after making 30% profit in the stock).I saw potential in Arm due to its road map and low market capital (lots of room to grow vs Nvidia market cap). I moved 20% of that into ARM taking a calculated risk but also running off profit.
