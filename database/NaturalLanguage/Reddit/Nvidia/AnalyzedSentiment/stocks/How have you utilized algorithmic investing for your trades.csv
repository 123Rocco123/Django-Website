I think there's a sweet spot opportunity for the right individual investor (one smarter than me) who can more or less stay out of the way of the whales. They could maybe develop a strategy of swing trading small/mid cap stocks on odd, yet predictable cycles that maybe take a cue from the spending habits or some of the trends of the big players. I.e. purchase every friday afternoon when the big players have unloaded the riskier assets for the weekend and plan to sell every monday when they're coming in with fresh cash. That being said, algorithmic investing is no joke. The signal to noise ratio in the market is outrageous, doubly so with smaller stocks, and you can't just throw the kitchen sink into XgBoost and expect it to print money. You would need to carefully select your data (which will be extremely hard to come by as an individual btw), and you'd need to be an expert in de-noising it correctly (fourier transformations), handling radical/anomalous values, dealing with missing data, measuring data/model drift over time, time series analysis modeling, avoiding data leakage (which is non-trivial in this case), evaluating your model performance, etc.   And a small mistake at any one of those steps could cost you money.
