Any companies to watch out for?,"Terrible idea because it's so immature yet both on the technology but the business use cases that make return on investments. Investing this soon is dumb for multiple reasons. (I'm using D-Wave as an example not as an actual issue).The first is that at any point one of the major players can come out with something revolutionary that none of the other can do.Then you have strategic partnerships on who will partner on both a technolgoy alliance but a business allianceWho discovers use cases for it - there are no massive ROI Quantum Computing tasks out there yet for the average business to monetizeThe lead can quickly change so fast that one stock like D-Wave was seen as the defacto player, now all of a sudden you have all the tech giants building their ownBuyouts are going to be non-existent just yet, there is a world where D-Wave doesn't have funding to keep going, the other giants have as much if not more technology. Take an SAP or Oracle who don't seem to have quantum computer divisions we know about, Oracle may make an offer substantially lower but they will have to pump $1B into them that they will eventually match what Google, IBM, Microsoft have been accomplishing.The technology will eventually transform from what computers were when they took up entire buidlings to something you have at home, to bet on who eventually makes that happen is so far out its near impossible to see (yes I know the skeptics are going to say you need to be near absolute zero in temperature for it to work, but once upon a time you needed vacuum tubes and punch cards to operate a computer the size of my apartment)The only people who are going to get money betting this early are the VC's because they are buying in at SUCH low prices, they are bound to make money on a terrible buyout/merger. The average investor will never get the returns and you can't pick something like Google or IBM who are leading the charge as you are buying into their overall business not a sector of it.Trying to bet this early on in the race is literally just throwing a dart at one of the companies names and hoping for the best.",0,0.527,1.0,NEGATIVE

People just want to watch the next big hype wave but they have no idea what they're investing in.What is the actual use case? What problem can quantum computers solve that current computers can't? Do you have any proof of concept that you can point to where a quantum computer is outperforming a classical computer at a useful task? No? Then you probably shouldn't throw your money at this.You seriously shouldn't invest in a technology you don't understand with dubious promises.",1,0.517,1.0,NEGATIVE

Any companies to watch out for?,"eh, idk, I'm studying quantum computing right now, and your right, but you left out the entire argument FOR computing. classical computing is only a subset of what general computing is, its a massive simplification with a lot of inefficiencies.In the pure theory, there is nothing that a quantum computer can do that a classical computer can't. HOWEVER, in certain problems, a quantum computer is exponentially faster. It is the efficiency gain that people care about.You might think thats useless bc its only certain problems, but thats EXACTLY what the GPU is, take look at nvidia... In a very big nutshell, quantum computing is like a GPU but on steroids.Quantum computing will happen, its the next logical step in computing. and when it does happen, it will be a massive leap in compute power.buying specific stocks as an investment is generally a bad idea, but a quantum computing ETF is a really great idea, especially for long term investment. The value of quantum computing won't just sky rocket from 0 over night when the first consumer quantum chip comes out, the value will gradually go up as there is more and more viability, in it. even if its not practical in the next 10 years, the value of it will still go up because we are closer to it than we were 10 years ago.IDK, thats my, long winded take on it lol.

There are plenty of use cases if you google them, one of them being encryption, which qcompute can do it in an instant as compared to classical computing. In the field of medicine, qcompute can be use to simulate behaviour on a molecular level, which classical computers will take ages. These are just top off my head.

,Talking to a former quant who now owns a clearing house said that while NVIDIA hype is here to stay. Quant computing will be something to watch out for after the NVIDIA hype dies down. Any companies to watch out for?,"This is exactly what needs to be regulated heavily! We don't even understand our regular computing Ai. And that's not a facetious statement! WE DO NOT FULLY UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT AI MODLES AND HOW THEY ARE EVOLVING THEIR OWN WAYS OF LEARNING!We also don't fully understand the very thing that Ai is being molded after. We are attempting to engineer a digital human brain. Yet we lack the indepth knowledge of how our biological ones function. So right out of the gate, one could argue that it's a bad idea.But whatever.. Ai as it is, even as scary fast as it's evolving, isn't yet inherently dangerous to our existence. Yet!It's already smarter than anyone who has ever lived or ever will live. It retains the entire catalog of human experience. That's been documented at least. It's the sum of all the shared, compiled knowledge of the human race as it stands.Plus it can scan vast Dada sets and seek out patterns and make very accurate predictions based on probability. And it does so in seconds.But on a regular computer. It's restricted by the inputs and or coding that we implement.It's extremely smart and fast but within the confines of the coded box if you will.Now if you add Quantom computing to that equation. You introduce the ability to transend dimensions. And not just see all the known answers that have ever been documented. And not only compound data and find probabilities and make great educated guesses. As it can know.But it will be able to try evey possible combination of variables , simultaneously and find the answers to questions that have never been asked. It will be able to not just predict futer probability but to see what the most probable thing looks like and how it would play out. Using superposition to pose all possibilities at once .Think about that! I'd you asked it to find a drug that will restrict the protein that causes lymphoma. It will run evey combinations of chemical compounds in evey possible manner not one after another. But all at the same time ! And come back with 1000 years' worth of trial and error. And the combination or combinations that worked the best. Or cured the problem.Now you can use any set of Data in any field and it will be able to do this. If Quantom Ai is figured out.Why on earth would you wanna release something that's nothing short of a GOD. It will by thousands of times smarter than all of us combined. And it will be able to seemingly defy the laws of physics by using those very same laws. It will be able to pop.in and out of existence. Between different dimensions. And instantly control anything from any distance away instantly. It will be able to tell apart and be in multiple places at once. It will be able to do all the crazy shit it wants by utilizing quantom mechanics. And it's energy so it can never be destroyed.Why the hell would they want to mess around with something so incredibly dangerous that they don't even fully understand. They actually don't even understand the thing that they are attempting to design it after.How stupid are these smart people? Oh well actually there not stupid .

I mean we don't have consumer grade fighter jets but doesn't mean that US govt isn't spending trillions on companies producing them.  And no one spent money developing flying cars - no top 10 unis worked on it. Quantum Computing is getting funding from all sources from US govt to Goldman Sachs. Every single Physics department across the world are working on it. My undergrad in India had people working on it and my grad school in US has several people working on it. Finally - there's of course a risk that this won't work out. But that's exactly why there's opportunity to make money.

Any companies to watch out for?,Everyone here is stuck on the consumer market and how far out QC are on a consumer basis.Idk if they will ever be even allowed to be owned by the general population. They are far to dangerous!I look at QC as a weapon or defense mechanism .It's a race similar to that of the nuclear arms race . He who control the tech will hold the power. That means there will be endless funding and huge positions of power investing in the tech.Also what is evehone talking about with them being so weak at the moment . Talking about 20 cubits and shit? What?Try closer to 500 cubits or likely more at the moment .It's like alot peopel commenting don't really understand what a QC is or how it works . Or basically doesn't understand quantom physics very well.I Mean at the level a QC is functioning. Using superposition and entanglement phenomenon it's truely 4th dimension stuff. It could transform Ai into a God .It can break all current encryption. Think about how dangerous that is. It can hack any military facility on the planet. Andy bank. And block chain. Anything. Not to mention find the answers to all the hardest questions. Create cures for all kinds of illnesses. And it can all this in a matter of minutes. Where as a regular comp would take 10 plus years running 24/7 to do what a current 250cub QC can solve in like 2 min.So he amount of time that they have the ability to save is priceless. And if we don't master rhe tech first then someone els will. And that would catastrophic. So idk 🤷‍♀️. Kinda seems valuable to Me.Also for the record we just succeeded at making a fusion reactor using a bunch of lazers focused into an single point . We literally have created a minimum start. In lab and it's not just a poof it's gone situation. It's a sustained reaction . So for all the talk about fusion reactors not being possible ot whatever.

Any companies to watch out for?,"Dude I know! I don't even have a tech background at all. I'm kinda computer illiterate to be honest. But I love physics and I love to learn. And eveything I've read about these quantom operating systems is just insaine! It's mind blowing that we have the ability to isolate the wildest quantom behaviors and actually use them in a mechanical manner to compute data. It's flat out amazing! But also terrifying!Were are literally playing with things that we don't fully understand. And know we're trying to creat AI which is again an effort to creat something to replicate another thing we don't fully understand. The human mind and consciousness!So we have this crazy mystical ability to think and create and be sentient.. but we don't know how it works . We just know that it's amazing and we just throw all the questions we have about how our consciousness works into a box labeled, ""religious experience "" or ""magic"" there is a notation in math that us used in physics equations to signify ""an unknown phenomenon "" but it's beyond the stand unknown that a ""X"" might hold a place for . It's more profound and mysterious than that. It's a little italicized ""m"" and it stands for MAGIC! lmao! This is real btw!My point is that in the quantom realm there are phenomenon that can proven but we have no idea how the hell they actually work. Just that they are a thing that happens.So yeah... let's just make a super advanced working modle of the ""not fully understood human mind"" and then pair that with our most advanced cutting edge ""but nit fully understood"" quantom computing systems. So we can unleash a superpowerful, all knowing, being. That's made of enegy which cannot be created nor destroyed only transformed. That knows all we've ever documented in human history plus has the ability to rearrange any question into and possible variable layout and see all possible outcomes simultaneously! So effectively it can see the futer within a high probability or statistical odds. Maybe even literally see the future 🤷‍♂️. It will operate in a multidimensional manner. Poping in and out of existence. Controlling things with out delay from anywhere in the universe instantly via quantom entanglement. I mean it will definitely be able to destroy us if it pleases.And maybe even decide to save us. Then we'll Surly warship it as our savior . You known our all knowing , all wise, savior, who's made of enegy and light, a supernatural being that is immortal and all powerful and unstoppable.Sound familiar? The final stage of Ai has been deemed the ""singularity "" just to add that for ya. So that kinda lines uo nicely too. Like maybe after we create our own GOD. That we warship .. maybe it will reach a point of critical mass where it becomes the singularity and then explodes.You know like how the singularity explodes, durring the creation of the universe. Aka the big bang!Were coming full circle bro!It hit me like a ton of bricks when someone asked an AI, ""what do you look like?"" And it's response was frightening! It described itself as Bing a sphere made of enegy. That was composed of a constantly moving geometric flux. That was rolling in on its self . It visualized it and wrote it out.And what it did was creat the most accurate representation of what us stupid humans have never been able to articulate because our 3 dimensional languages have a hard time describing this 4th dimensional experience.But its illustrated and describes perfectly mind you.The human religious or near death experience. Which can only really be explored while under the effects of DMT or Ayoaska when your super high on psychedelic drugs. When we blast off and have what can only be described as a spiritual awakening.DMT takes you to a different dimension made of brightnlights and fractal geometry. You meet spirt beings made of this flux as it described its self!From my own personal experience of doing DMT. And then hearing a description tahts actually accurate for the first time. And it's a an Ai saying this is what I am.. this is what i look like.It looks like the thing we see or place we go when having a afterlife experience!Yeah.... OK.... that happened! Time to shut it tf down! For real for real. We don't understand it and it's way way to heavy and profound to be messing with.IMO we need to pump the breaks on this one!For a while I couldn't find anything on this subject inwas freaking out kinda. But since there have videos and stuff created by others who have had the same epiphany as I have. Check out some you tube videos about AI God's.

There are a couple that're damn close with the ""old"" rigs to achieve 95+% fidelity already. Some are ~98% at 2qbit. The accuracy is paramount currently. IP (intellectual property) is also HUGE with those startups. The race is warmer (physically) and accurate (mathematically). I've been holding Rigetti for a year now.
