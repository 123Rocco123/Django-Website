For decades, we've seen the desire and possibly need, to detach or atleast supplement fossil energy. Nuclear has been the topic of fear and the boogeyman of energy. Through time, education, and refinement of processes, we are learning how safe it is and the public is trending towards seeing through the illusion of catastrophic danger. We've also seen how much money it takes for renewable energy simply to damage wildlife and not yield nearly enough ROI. So there is a demand for nuclear, and soon sentiment may (will) influence policy. The question is when, and will something new and Shiney appear before that time.Approach:It's too far away to tell what companies will end up as the big players. Obviously, some like Cameco is interesting, but as they develop products and processes, could a larger established company like GEV copy/paste and knock them off? Or will a smaller company do something innovative with speed and scale that they gap competition for years? (NVDA method)I'm lightly playing ETFs for the miners and the producers.

All of these utilities stock went from very cheap to fairly expensive.Data center load isn't as much as what people like to believe. Each is like 50-100 mw, trivial compared to total load which easily goes up to 10-30 gw. Ev is way more. I guess with the momentum and AI hype they can still go up, just like every other semiconductor stocks or anything that brings up AI. But frankly the revenue increase would be in the order of 2-3% annually at most",0,0.548,1.0,NEGATIVE
