So I think Microsoft can have the last laugh, what do you guys think?",This is a bit misleading. Even Microsoft stated they don’t own any part of Open AI. Though reports have said that Microsoft is entitled to up to 49% of Open AI’s profits over a given amount of time. But I’d take this with a grain of salt as well since the “agreements are confidential”.,2,0.553,1.0,NEGATIVE

Who knows what's really in that contract. I've only read about the ownership structure in some articles who author most likely didnt see it. Ive also read that if Open AI does achieve AGI, then Mircosoft and the other minority owners beside the nonprofit have no ownership over that product and only have a stake in the older products at that point.https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.ft.com/content/458b162d-c97a-4464-8afc-72d65afb28ed&ved=2ahUKEwjwwZvTtOSGAxUuIUQIHdHxAM04ChDF9AEoAHoECA4QAg&usg=AOvVaw0EVKVFY5FBL800cax9Yj0B",3,0.524,0.999,NEGATIVE

Apple and Microsoft compete but they also have exclusive areas cloud, office tooling and dev tooling for Microsoft and phones and devices for Apple (Microsoft is a fairly small player in devices).Nvidia benefits from anyone using AI in long term. So to me it more sounds like the 3 competing helps each other indirectly causing the whole sector to grow.",0,0.538,0.995,POSITIVE
