,"So I was looking at the historical prices for NVIDIA late last night, wondering if I had thrown $3k into it that I made in 2021 whether I would have been better off. The price (according to search engines) was under $10 in March 2021. Yet they have had several stock splits including a 10/1 split just a month or so back. So when talking about the prices is it there some wonkny reconstructive math you need to find the ""real"" purchase price? I am currently unemployed and going through a rough time (am blind, lost job, have been home since late last year).. to cope while I wait for an SSDI check I am consulting the Yijing and reading stock news. I made $60 turn into $3400 with its help, might not hurt to try again.",From my experience the historical prices are adjusted based on the split. Considering AAPL IPOd at $22/share but if you look at historical prices on Yahoo Finance it has the price at around $0.13/share.,0,0.539,0.999,NEGATIVE

To get the ""real price"" or at least a proxy, you would need to multiple your 2021 price by the split multiple. In this case, 4 and 10.",0,0.516,1.0,NEGATIVE

Probably easiest to divide $1600 to whatever the current data shows historically, then multiply that psuedo-share-number times today's price. (somewhere around 3.5M I think)",0,0.535,0.998,POSITIVE
