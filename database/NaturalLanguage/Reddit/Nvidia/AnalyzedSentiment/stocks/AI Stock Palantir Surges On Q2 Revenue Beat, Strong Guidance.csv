Reddit was in a frenzy over the AI boom, nvidia being the signature darling following aapls fall out of popularity. Meanwhile pltr was not really touted as an AI player nor should they be. They are more data aggregation and analysis not amorphous AI",2,0.543,NEGATIVE,1.0

Just what I keep seeing is they are an AI stock. I think Cathy woods may have said it's her top AI stock when she got shit over missing the NVDA boat.

I still don’t really follow your first comment. You’re saying Redditors are astute and didn’t get caught up in AI hype and that’s why they hated on pltr?

But I’m disagree with your comment because 1. Reddit sentiment was falling over itself for AI hype, again see NVDA and 2. Reeled it has hated on pltr for longer than the AI hype was running and the primary reason cited was always share dilution and lack of development of the company when it was private, as well as a general hatred for Peter thiel which again fair enough but not an AI hype thing",6,0.548,NEGATIVE,1.0
