I was comparing it to 2330, which tends to have a PE gap from TSM of 3 or less but it is around 6 now. 2330 is TSM's Taiwan Stock Exchange ticker. Also keep in mind that the company is trading at a high premium to historical PEs which means one bad quarter can cause the company to crater in value. This is a cylical industry and once the current capex cycle ends the company's revenue and earnings growth will stabilize. I'm not going to attempt to predict a peak value for the stock price in the next five years since that is way beyond my depth and most pros get it wrong anyway.Hon Hai (2317) is available at a much cheaper valuation so comes with margin of safety and an asymmetric payoff if you have a long term vision. I have bought it with a 20 year outlook in mind. I also own a decent amount of 2330 relative to my portfolio size.",4,0.574,NEGATIVE,0.998
