,"Benjamin Graham once said, “Investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike.” This quote inspired me to design an investment strategy that mirrors the due diligence and rigor of buying a private business. Instead of relying on trends or speculation, I sought to focus on key factors that truly drive long-term value. These include growth per share, creditworthiness, return on invested capital (ROIC), and shareholder payout. By integrating these metrics into a systematic framework, I aimed to build a strategy that’s rooted in solid business fundamentals. The Composite Growth Strategy The framework of my Composite Growth Strategy evaluates companies based on eight critical areas that mimic how you might analyze a private business acquisition: 1. Growth Per Share Focuses on per-share growth in sales, free cash flow, operating cash flow, and gross profit to ensure that growth benefits shareholders directly. 2. Absolute Growth Measures overall growth in gross profit, sales, operating cash flow, and free cash flow, emphasizing strong financial performance. 3. Creditworthiness Evaluates financial stability by analyzing metrics like cash relative to short-term debt, debt coverage through cash flow, and interest expense as a percentage of sales. 4. Low Dilution Prioritizes companies that avoid diluting shareholders by controlling the growth of outstanding shares. 5. Intangible Monetization Assesses how effectively a company utilizes intangible assets, such as intellectual property and goodwill, to generate profits and cash flow. 6. Retained ROIC Composite Measures how well a company reinvests profits into its business, ensuring efficient use of capital to create long-term value. 7. Raw ROIC Composite Analyzes profitability relative to invested capital, focusing on returns generated from gross profit, operating cash flow, and operating income. 8. Shareholder Payout Examines how companies reward shareholders through dividends, buybacks, and consistent increases in payout over time. Backtesting Results To validate this strategy, I used backtesting software adjusted for look-ahead bias, spanning data from 2001 to the present. Stocks were ranked every four weeks based on the Composite Growth Strategy, with rankings from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest). The results demonstrated a clear trend: • The top-ranked stocks (quantile 10) achieved an annualized excess return of 4.72% over the benchmark.  • Conversely, the lowest-ranked stocks (quantile 1) underperformed by -7.81% annually.  • Quantiles in between showed a consistent gradient, with performance improving as rankings increased. This illustrates that the metrics used in the Composite Growth Strategy not only identify high-quality businesses but also consistently add value over time.

In a similar vein, portfolio backtests on the intersection of value and profitability have found that profitability metrics alone don't came close to dominating returns over them. They do beat the S&P index handily.The second potential problem is that this methodology favors companies that have already matured, not ones with a long growth runway. Growth is neither steady nor exponential: it functions along a S-curve. Unsurprisingly, most of these companies currently have bloated valuations (using the UAFRS database as reference) due to investors betting that future growth will continue.

,"Benjamin Graham once said, “Investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike.” This quote inspired me to design an investment strategy that mirrors the due diligence and rigor of buying a private business. Instead of relying on trends or speculation, I sought to focus on key factors that truly drive long-term value. These include growth per share, creditworthiness, return on invested capital (ROIC), and shareholder payout. By integrating these metrics into a systematic framework, I aimed to build a strategy that’s rooted in solid business fundamentals. The Composite Growth Strategy The framework of my Composite Growth Strategy evaluates companies based on eight critical areas that mimic how you might analyze a private business acquisition: 1. Growth Per Share Focuses on per-share growth in sales, free cash flow, operating cash flow, and gross profit to ensure that growth benefits shareholders directly. 2. Absolute Growth Measures overall growth in gross profit, sales, operating cash flow, and free cash flow, emphasizing strong financial performance. 3. Creditworthiness Evaluates financial stability by analyzing metrics like cash relative to short-term debt, debt coverage through cash flow, and interest expense as a percentage of sales. 4. Low Dilution Prioritizes companies that avoid diluting shareholders by controlling the growth of outstanding shares. 5. Intangible Monetization Assesses how effectively a company utilizes intangible assets, such as intellectual property and goodwill, to generate profits and cash flow. 6. Retained ROIC Composite Measures how well a company reinvests profits into its business, ensuring efficient use of capital to create long-term value. 7. Raw ROIC Composite Analyzes profitability relative to invested capital, focusing on returns generated from gross profit, operating cash flow, and operating income. 8. Shareholder Payout Examines how companies reward shareholders through dividends, buybacks, and consistent increases in payout over time. Backtesting Results To validate this strategy, I used backtesting software adjusted for look-ahead bias, spanning data from 2001 to the present. Stocks were ranked every four weeks based on the Composite Growth Strategy, with rankings from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest). The results demonstrated a clear trend: • The top-ranked stocks (quantile 10) achieved an annualized excess return of 4.72% over the benchmark.  • Conversely, the lowest-ranked stocks (quantile 1) underperformed by -7.81% annually.  • Quantiles in between showed a consistent gradient, with performance improving as rankings increased. This illustrates that the metrics used in the Composite Growth Strategy not only identify high-quality businesses but also consistently add value over time. Top 25 Ranked Stocks (as of 12/05/24) Here are the current top-ranked stocks based on the Composite Growth Strategy: 1. NVIDIA Corp (NVDA)  2. Emerson Electric (EME)  3. Meta Platforms (META)  4.

First is that there’s some notable stocks missing from the whole list like AAPL or AMZN. Were they once present or do they never fit these criteria? Secondly, for that matter, what does the top list look like over time? Does the ratio of growth to value fluctuate or is it always tech and industrials as it is predominantly here? I’d be worried that this strategy just filters out certain sectors and appears to outperform because tech has done well since 2001. Also are there significant and frequent changes requiring rebalancing (and associated costs)?Thirdly, how’s the volatility? Does it achieve risk adjusted outperformance? And how do periods like 2008, 2020, 2022 perform? Do companies with these metrics tend to stand their ground well during downturns or is it outperformance at the cost of stomach-churning drawdowns?Hope that’s not too many questions!!

,"Benjamin Graham once said, “Investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike.” This quote inspired me to design an investment strategy that mirrors the due diligence and rigor of buying a private business. Instead of relying on trends or speculation, I sought to focus on key factors that truly drive long-term value. These include growth per share, creditworthiness, return on invested capital (ROIC), and shareholder payout. By integrating these metrics into a systematic framework, I aimed to build a strategy that’s rooted in solid business fundamentals. The Composite Growth Strategy The framework of my Composite Growth Strategy evaluates companies based on eight critical areas that mimic how you might analyze a private business acquisition: 1. Growth Per Share Focuses on per-share growth in sales, free cash flow, operating cash flow, and gross profit to ensure that growth benefits shareholders directly. 2. Absolute Growth Measures overall growth in gross profit, sales, operating cash flow, and free cash flow, emphasizing strong financial performance. 3. Creditworthiness Evaluates financial stability by analyzing metrics like cash relative to short-term debt, debt coverage through cash flow, and interest expense as a percentage of sales. 4. Low Dilution Prioritizes companies that avoid diluting shareholders by controlling the growth of outstanding shares. 5. Intangible Monetization Assesses how effectively a company utilizes intangible assets, such as intellectual property and goodwill, to generate profits and cash flow. 6. Retained ROIC Composite Measures how well a company reinvests profits into its business, ensuring efficient use of capital to create long-term value. 7. Raw ROIC Composite Analyzes profitability relative to invested capital, focusing on returns generated from gross profit, operating cash flow, and operating income. 8. Shareholder Payout Examines how companies reward shareholders through dividends, buybacks, and consistent increases in payout over time. Backtesting Results To validate this strategy, I used backtesting software adjusted for look-ahead bias, spanning data from 2001 to the present. Stocks were ranked every four weeks based on the Composite Growth Strategy, with rankings from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest). The results demonstrated a clear trend: • The top-ranked stocks (quantile 10) achieved an annualized excess return of 4.72% over the benchmark.  • Conversely, the lowest-ranked stocks (quantile 1) underperformed by -7.81% annually.  • Quantiles in between showed a consistent gradient, with performance improving as rankings increased. This illustrates that the metrics used in the Composite Growth Strategy not only identify high-quality businesses but also consistently add value over time. Top 25 Ranked Stocks (as of 12/05/24) Here are the current top-ranked stocks based on the Composite Growth Strategy: 1. NVIDIA Corp (NVDA)  2. Emerson Electric (EME)  3. Meta Platforms (META)  4.

Absolute Growth Measures overall growth in gross profit, sales, operating cash flow, and free cash flow, emphasizing strong financial performance. 3. Creditworthiness Evaluates financial stability by analyzing metrics like cash relative to short-term debt, debt coverage through cash flow, and interest expense as a percentage of sales. 4. Low Dilution Prioritizes companies that avoid diluting shareholders by controlling the growth of outstanding shares. 5. Intangible Monetization Assesses how effectively a company utilizes intangible assets, such as intellectual property and goodwill, to generate profits and cash flow. 6. Retained ROIC Composite Measures how well a company reinvests profits into its business, ensuring efficient use of capital to create long-term value. 7. Raw ROIC Composite Analyzes profitability relative to invested capital, focusing on returns generated from gross profit, operating cash flow, and operating income. 8. Shareholder Payout Examines how companies reward shareholders through dividends, buybacks, and consistent increases in payout over time. Backtesting Results To validate this strategy, I used backtesting software adjusted for look-ahead bias, spanning data from 2001 to the present. Stocks were ranked every four weeks based on the Composite Growth Strategy, with rankings from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest). The results demonstrated a clear trend: • The top-ranked stocks (quantile 10) achieved an annualized excess return of 4.72% over the benchmark.  • Conversely, the lowest-ranked stocks (quantile 1) underperformed by -7.81% annually.  • Quantiles in between showed a consistent gradient, with performance improving as rankings increased. This illustrates that the metrics used in the Composite Growth Strategy not only identify high-quality businesses but also consistently add value over time. Top 25 Ranked Stocks (as of 12/05/24) Here are the current top-ranked stocks based on the Composite Growth Strategy: 1. NVIDIA Corp (NVDA)  2. Emerson Electric (EME)  3. Meta Platforms (META)  4.

Thanks again 🙏 a good way to build an interesting picture. Would be interesting to run back through the data you’ve created and see if you can extract any absolute values worth building a strategy around. Sounds like the 2022 underperformance might help with that too.I understand the efficiency of the relative scoring, but would be great if you could weave in some critical levels and see the impact.What do you plan to do with it next?",2,0.521,1.0,POSITIVE

Instead of relying on trends or speculation, I sought to focus on key factors that truly drive long-term value. These include growth per share, creditworthiness, return on invested capital (ROIC), and shareholder payout. By integrating these metrics into a systematic framework, I aimed to build a strategy that’s rooted in solid business fundamentals. The Composite Growth Strategy The framework of my Composite Growth Strategy evaluates companies based on eight critical areas that mimic how you might analyze a private business acquisition: 1. Growth Per Share Focuses on per-share growth in sales, free cash flow, operating cash flow, and gross profit to ensure that growth benefits shareholders directly. 2. Absolute Growth Measures overall growth in gross profit, sales, operating cash flow, and free cash flow, emphasizing strong financial performance. 3. Creditworthiness Evaluates financial stability by analyzing metrics like cash relative to short-term debt, debt coverage through cash flow, and interest expense as a percentage of sales. 4. Low Dilution Prioritizes companies that avoid diluting shareholders by controlling the growth of outstanding shares. 5. Intangible Monetization Assesses how effectively a company utilizes intangible assets, such as intellectual property and goodwill, to generate profits and cash flow. 6. Retained ROIC Composite Measures how well a company reinvests profits into its business, ensuring efficient use of capital to create long-term value. 7. Raw ROIC Composite Analyzes profitability relative to invested capital, focusing on returns generated from gross profit, operating cash flow, and operating income. 8. Shareholder Payout Examines how companies reward shareholders through dividends, buybacks, and consistent increases in payout over time. Backtesting Results To validate this strategy, I used backtesting software adjusted for look-ahead bias, spanning data from 2001 to the present. Stocks were ranked every four weeks based on the Composite Growth Strategy, with rankings from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest). The results demonstrated a clear trend: • The top-ranked stocks (quantile 10) achieved an annualized excess return of 4.72% over the benchmark.  • Conversely, the lowest-ranked stocks (quantile 1) underperformed by -7.81% annually.  • Quantiles in between showed a consistent gradient, with performance improving as rankings increased. This illustrates that the metrics used in the Composite Growth Strategy not only identify high-quality businesses but also consistently add value over time. Top 25 Ranked Stocks (as of 12/05/24) Here are the current top-ranked stocks based on the Composite Growth Strategy: 1. NVIDIA Corp (NVDA)  2. Emerson Electric (EME)  3. Meta Platforms (META)  4.
