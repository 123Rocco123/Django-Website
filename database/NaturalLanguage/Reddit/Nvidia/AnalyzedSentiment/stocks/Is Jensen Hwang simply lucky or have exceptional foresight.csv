The transformer model architecture which revolutionized machine translation and language modeling would not be published until 2017. The AlexNet paper which was just about the first paper to leverage (Nvidia) GPUs to scale up image recognition did not come out until 2012. In 2012, this paper revolutionized the field by training a convolutional neural network (quite possibly the largest in the world at the time) on just two commercial grade Nvidia GTX 580 gaming GPUs.Does he mention machine learning at all in 2011? No.But go to roughly 30 minutes, and Jensen tells us exactly why Nvidia is successful today. He talks about GeforceFX and the invention of programmable shaders. Nvidia developed the first domain specific language (Cg; circa 2004) for building programmable shaders. Before Cg was invented, shaders were incredibly hard to program. Games like DOOM3 had to have specialized code paths for different GPUs and I believe the shaders themselves had to be written in a low level assembly-like language.Cg not only simplified the creation of shaders, but it also locked in gamedevs for several years into Nvidia's ecosystem. Furthermore, researchers at universities were able to hack it to use GPUs for general purpose computing. Just a few years later, Nvidia would release CUDA which is even better for getting GPUs to do general purpose computing.So the general idea is NVIDIA did not develop CUDA out of altruistic motives, nor did it do it to revolutionize machine learning. The goal was the same goal as with Cg and development of programmable shaders. It was to expand the GPU market into general purpose computing. In 2004 the biggest driver of Nvidia GPUs was Doom 3 and Half-life 2. In 2024, gaming represents less than 10% of Nvidia's sales!Nvidia continues to do this. Nvidia hardware has expanded into robotics, machine learning, bioinformatics... Nvidia actively develops new markets for its products and invests in the developer relations and software to satisfy customers within those markets.",0,0.535,POSITIVE,0.747

The idea of GPU compute was obvious at the time it was made. There were competing standards, and AMD even had a solution before CUDA (https://www.techpowerup.com/20156/amds-close-to-metal-technology-increases-processing-application-performance-by-eightfold). Apple even bet the horse on GPU Compute with the trash can Mac Pro.The issue is the competitors couldn’t stop tripping over themselves. Apple donated OpenCL to the khronos group where it basically was ruined, where NVIDIA were at least partially involved with its failure as they propped CUDA up instead. Since the competitors had thrown their hat in on OpenCL, when it failed, they had to go back to the drawing board with non-standard solutions.People underestimate what a set back that was for the rest of the industry and it let CUDA flourish. But it wasn’t a huge driver for growth till something came along that necessitated using it. Even with advances in ML markets, it wasn’t such a slam dunk win until generative AI became a thing.So it’s equal parts vision to stick with it and luck imho.

Adobe software adopted CUDA relatively quickly, and took longer to adopt openCL and in a more limited scope, implementing few features with it than CUDA. Likewise for Autodesk. Even Blender's Cycles renderer was biased towards the CUDA implementation. It was more stable, ran better, it was recommended by the community for anyone looking to do GPU rendering, and IIRC AMD had to sponsor and co-author a re-write of Cycles' openCL implementation to get it working properly on anything other than Nvidia GPUs.OpenCL 2 was what dropped the ball and what NVIDIA specifically chose not to supportIt's hard to say AMD actually supported it either when their openCL drivers remained broken through the 2010s. https://www.anandtech.com/show/14618/the-amd-radeon-rx-5700-xt-rx-5700-review/13 And 2.2 was DOA.

For example AMD have Radeon Pro Studio which is an OSS competitor to part of Omniverse (render and sync) and combined with something like Houdini (for data processing) and Unreal Engine (for interactivity) you can replicate most of what Omniverse is used for by their clients. I know of a few companies that are spinning up their own internal tooling off that stack to split from Omniverse.Isaac has no off the shelf competitors but several companies in the space have their own equivalents in house.The value of Isaac and Omniverse, is not so much their technical capabilities but that they essentially provide support and dedicated development for a company. Clients are essentially outsourcing development of features to NVIDIA.I think that anything that depends on continued service contracts is more easily replaced, unless they have a technical moat which I don’t see in Omniverse or Isaac. Windows to me doesn’t fall under that umbrella because they have a huge technical moat in the form of long term compatibility. That’s the same reason I think CUDA is a moat.

Can't get lucky if not in the position to take advantage of an advantageous position. Nvidia has been using software as their differentiator for at least 20 years. At least half of that company are software developers. Something AMD and Intel underrated until the post ChatGPT world (at least AMD probably couldn't afford it). They're lucky Huang is as he is. An electrical engineer that gave software equal or greater emphasis. 30 years of that balance. Electrical engineering background and you wouldn't be surprised if his strategy would have been to just keep hiring electrical engineers and the minimal needed software developers. Luckily he's not that kind of hardware engineerAMD was so in their death throws until 2017 so I give them some slack for their transition to a software company speed. Intel larrabee failure and they're extremely late to the game with ARC. Their software is behind AMD and I'm saying that having an ARC GPU. Regardless what I'm getting at is Nvidia has had a CEO that recognized the importance of software since at least the early 2000s.I think Lisa Su recognized that in 2014 but wasn't in the financial position to push software until their CPU division was out of the dog house. I think back to AMD Mantle. I think since physx GPU acceleration and small utilities like Shadowplay and Nvidias GPU driver reputation compared to their own, AMD has recognized the importance of software but just didn't have the finances after the Intel paying off vendors to not buy AMD and the Bulldozer era disasterLisa Su is 2014, AMD doesn't have the finances to become a software company until like 2020. More like the past year as AMD has taken a good chunk of server market share. So 10 years of leadership that respects the need for software parity and foresight (I think longer they were just broke with a bulldozer dud). Intel I don't know what to make with them. They're burning so much cash on fab development and losing market share to Epyc, I don't know how much they can put towards software development support for their GPUsSo at least 20 years of well funded software focus for Nvidia whereas AMD has been cash strapped focus of about ten years and Intel recent years. For now wherever computing goes, I'd expect Nvidia to pivot well, AMD probably as well, Intel maybe after another decade of soul searching and streamlining. I have 2 Intel ARC cards primarily for video encoding but while they may be great for that, I may jump ship to AMD or Nvidia. Intel isn't in the position to act on foresight. Nvidia is.

They told the researchesr it would eventually all be about APUs, they refused to make a proper linux driver despite the researchers telling them that the gpgpu was fine, they didn't need some new chipNvidia, however, was facing a crisis.

It was by necessity, not insight, that nvidia did answer the researchers pleas. At that point they would try anything, they need to sell gpusThe rest is his history. It turns out AMD was totally wrong. They still don't really have a hydrid chip. Linux was in fact the enterprise OS. General computing is possible on GPUs. Discrete devices offer more versatility to clients, why pay huge amount for a chip with a good cpu if I only need a gpu? The list goes onSo yes, they got lucky.

He created his platform (the graphics card) and just waited.Of course, the platform went through many evolutions. Ultimately, it was only a matter of time before the technological advancements came along and the platform could be upgraded to A.I.His company beat the others in this space because there were so many developments and choices. The GTX 980 had a price point for each consumer when released... the 970, 980 or the 980 Ti, and the Titan. AMD just didn't do the same.Fundamentally, the PCI slot used for the early graphics cards that were made 20 years ago is the same slot in PCs today. A GT710 uses the same slot in the PC motherboard as the modern RTX 3080.Maybe in 50 years, that same platform could be used in something else that we haven't seen yet. Like emotion chips. Or biological chips. Or phase chips on space ships, I just don't know. The unknown unknowns.So, build a platform that is a standard globally and can be updated and improved. You will stand the test of time.Facebook may come and go, like MySpace. Amazon may come and go. These don't have physical barriers to entry. That's why they spend so much effort keeping you on that screen.Of course, there was a bit of luck involved, also.....I let chatgpt review what I wrote out of interest, and here's the revised version--- Your text has a strong idea, but it could benefit from some clarity and smoother transitions. Here's a revised version with slight tweaks for flow:Good question.His company was strategic. He created the platform—initially focused on graphics cards—and simply waited for the right moment.Of course, the platform evolved over time, going through multiple iterations. Ultimately, technological advancements made it possible to upgrade the platform for AI applications.His company outpaced the competition because they offered a variety of options and kept up with rapid developments. For example, when the GTX 980 launched, there were different price points for consumers: the 970, 980, 980 Ti, and even the Titan. AMD didn’t take the same approach, which limited their appeal.At the core of it all is the PCI slot. The same PCI slot that was used for early graphics cards 20 years ago is still used in today’s PCs. A GT710 fits in the same slot as a modern RTX 3080.Who knows what this platform might support in the next 50 years? It could be emotion chips, biological chips, or phase chips for space ships—the possibilities are endless. The unknown unknowns.The key takeaway? Build a platform that becomes a global standard, one that can be continuously updated and improved, and it will stand the test of time.Look at companies like Facebook and Amazon—they might come and go, just as MySpace did. They lack physical barriers to entry, which is why they put so much effort into keeping users engaged with their platforms.Of course, there was some luck involved too.",0,0.534,NEGATIVE,0.998

Will he also create big winners in those spaces as well or will he over stretch himself and his company with so many ambitious projects?","I let chatgpt answer the OP question as we are on the topic of A.I. Here's what chat gpt said when I pasted the question.... ->Absolutely, I can provide some thoughts on those questions:1. Was Jensen Huang a visionary for investing in CUDA, or simply lucky?Huang's decision to invest in CUDA back in 2007 was far from guaranteed success. CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) required a huge amount of foresight because, at the time, GPUs were primarily used for graphics processing. Huang and Nvidia bet on the future of parallel computing, recognizing that GPUs could be repurposed for a wide range of computing tasks, particularly in scientific, machine learning, and AI fields. This decision to push CUDA, despite slow adoption, shows strategic foresight.What prevented others from doing something similar was likely a combination of risk tolerance, a lack of vision for GPU usage outside of gaming, and perhaps the failure to see the potential for parallel computing to become so widespread. Many companies are hesitant to invest heavily in something that doesn’t promise short-term returns, which Nvidia was willing to do.2. If you are invested in Nvidia, how much do you consider Hwang's foresight a valuable ""x-factor""?If I were an Nvidia investor, I would place significant weight on Huang's foresight as an ""x-factor."" His ability to anticipate market trends, like the rise of AI, data centers, and GPU-accelerated computing, has positioned Nvidia as a leader in several emerging fields. The value here isn't just in technological innovation but in consistently understanding the next big computing wave, as Nvidia's dominance in AI shows.Huang’s track record of driving Nvidia through multiple technology cycles—graphics, parallel computing, AI—suggests that his leadership and vision are crucial to the company’s long-term value. For many investors, his strategic foresight may be seen as priceless, and likely a major reason behind Nvidia’s market premium.3. If you don’t like Nvidia, how much of that is due to Huang?For those skeptical of Nvidia, Huang’s aggressive and ambitious strategy may be seen as a risk. While his success with CUDA, AI, and GPU leadership is undeniable, critics may point to potential overreach in his broader ambitions. Nvidia has seen some regulatory scrutiny, especially around its acquisition attempts (like ARM), and this could be seen as a reflection of Huang’s risk-taking behavior. Critics might argue that Nvidia has focused too much on diversifying into multiple sectors, which could dilute its focus and stretch resources.Mistakes might include underestimating competition from companies like AMD in the gaming and consumer space or failing to bring the ARM acquisition to fruition, which could have been a game-changing move for the company. Another potential criticism could be that Nvidia’s products are premium-priced, which sometimes alienates broader markets.4. What about Huang’s other projects (Omniverse, Isaac, self-driving)?Huang has certainly diversified Nvidia’s portfolio. Projects like Omniverse (for 3D design and simulations), Isaac (robotics), and Nvidia's self-driving platform demonstrate his ambition to position Nvidia at the forefront of multiple revolutionary industries. These are all cutting-edge fields, and if successful, they could provide Nvidia with additional revenue streams that further solidify its leadership in tech.However, the risk of overstretching is real. These projects demand immense resources, and the market for them is still maturing. For example, while self-driving cars are promising, widespread adoption has been slower than many expected. The Omniverse could become a big player in virtual worlds and digital twins, but it's not guaranteed. Critics might say that Huang is spreading the company too thin across too many unproven areas, which could detract from Nvidia's core strengths in GPUs and AI.That said, Huang has proven to have a knack for placing strategic bets, and if even a couple of these projects succeed, Nvidia could continue its dominant trajectory. Whether these ventures become big winners or overreach will depend largely on market timing and execution.In summary, Jensen Huang’s mix of foresight and risk-taking has undeniably shaped Nvidia’s success. While luck may play a role in any business venture, Huang’s consistent ability to stay ahead of technological trends has solidified Nvidia’s position. Whether Nvidia’s future success hinges on continuing to make those strategic bets or potentially slowing down to focus on core products is an open question.",1,0.535,NEGATIVE,0.956

It won’t dethrone NVIDIA anytime soon (or ever) but their growth shows there’s interest outside NVIDIA.Similarly Google have started pushing their latest TPUs towards clients more and have seen growth as well.Even Apple are starting to see an odd resurgence in home use when coupled with NVIDIA in the cloud due to their high RAM which is perfect for LLM.,1,0.536,POSITIVE,0.508
