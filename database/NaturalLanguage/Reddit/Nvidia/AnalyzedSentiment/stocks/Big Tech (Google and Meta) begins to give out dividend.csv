,"Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia been giving out dividends for a long time despite being a huge tech firm. As of recently, Google and Meta decide to begin giving out dividends to its shareholders. Is this seen as bullish? We hold big tech firms due to huge earning growth potential and they tend to distribute their earnings into innovation and R&D, which will with no doubt boost their future earning if done right. Now that Google and Meta begin to give out dividend, it seems appealing for mutual fund managers to add more into their portfolios, which will boost their stock prices further. But this will probably hurt their future earning potential in long term as they will have less allocated to R&D. What do y'all think? This will also give pressure to Amazon to consider offering dividend to their shareholders. Tesla? I don't think so.","I’m not an expert but these companies are making so much money that they have reached a point where they are earning more money than they can meaningfully reinvest in themselves without significant diminishing returns on those investments. So offering dividends has a more positive effect on shareholder value than reinvesting. I don’t think they’re spending less on R&D, it’s just that even after R&D they still got a shit ton of money left.",0,0.52,NEGATIVE,1.0

I don't know for sure what the timeframe on this may be, really depends on how many funds' conditions Google stock meets.

Is this seen as bullish? We hold big tech firms due to huge earning growth potential and they tend to distribute their earnings into innovation and R&D, which will with no doubt boost their future earning if done right. Now that Google and Meta begin to give out dividend, it seems appealing for mutual fund managers to add more into their portfolios, which will boost their stock prices further. But this will probably hurt their future earning potential in long term as they will have less allocated to R&D. What do y'all think?

If they dish out their value a bit through dividends, many countries have lower taxes on dividends or till certain number of investment income has lower % of taxes as well.So if i hold these for 10 years, these 10 years i can get a lot of tax value out of because of dividends.
