I'm just getting into AI myself, but I'll try to explain.While there are some similarities to the product maturity cycle you mentioned, the convergence hypothesis in AI is a bit different. It suggests that as AI research progresses, different model architectures (like GPT, PaLM, Claude, etc.) might start performing similarly well at core tasks (e.g., generating similar output for a given dataset), regardless of their specific design choices.Think of it less like product differentiation and more like how computer processors evolved - while early CPUs had wildly different architectures, they eventually converged on some common fundamental principles. In AI, this could mean that the 'secret sauce' shifts from having unique model architectures to having better training data and fine-tuning capabilities.This could affect NVIDIA because if model architectures become more standardized, the intense demand for specialized GPUs might slow down, as companies focus more on data quality than raw computing power for model innovation.",2,0.527,NEGATIVE,0.991
