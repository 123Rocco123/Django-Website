I liked that they're getting growth everywhere, especially autos, since this is a bad time for other autoparts suppliers. The gained on gaming graphics cards when AMD lost. They beat and raised on sovereign AI demand and projected demand, so that's scaling right now. I think Jensen's tone was overly defensive/annoyed on the conference call, but a lot of the questions felt overly speculative to me, who is biased. It sounds reasonable to me that the Blackwell rollout and scale up is impacting free cash flow and giving a paltry slap to margins. Rolling out a new architecture is an expensive process. Maybe some people are worried about what the yield will be and how that will impact expenses, but yield variability is table stakes for semiconductor stocks. Maybe people are worried that a small buyback signals danger, but what is NVDA supposed to do with the cash if they feel they are already scaling their technology sustainably? For me, it just means I own more.I wouldn't have guessed this result, and it smarts a little, but I like to remind myself that NVDA is WALL ST's favorite ST trading vehicle and a lot of the float is owned by hedge funds that dip in and out. It's PE goes up and down. Right now, I think its PE is lower than its 5-year average.Of course, exactly one year ago, NVDA had an earnings report and raised guidance that looked pretty darn good to me, and the market and NVDA pulled back until around November, back when $50 a share was the adjusted high.I'd like to see what happens tomorrow when there is actual daily volume, as options activity can move stuff a lot more after hours than during the trading day. I don't know what I missed on the call that amounted to a bear narrative. I think it's the expectation that costly problems can occur when you are scaling a new architecture. Redoing a phase mask in response to testing isn't great, but it seems like a par for the course expense. Demand still looks good. Hedge funds can play their games.",3,0.531,NEGATIVE,0.988

I don't know if that distinction makes sense. I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're seeing the priorities of people that are putting the dollars in the ground on this new technology and what their priorities are and their time frames are for that investment.Jensen Huang:The people who are investing in NVIDIA infrastructure are getting returns on it right away. It's the best ROI infrastructure, computing infrastructure investment you can make today. And so, one way to think through it, probably the most -- the easiest way to think through it is just go back to first principles.You have $1 trillion worth of general-purpose computing infrastructure. And the question is, do you want to build more of that or not? And for every $1 billion worth of Juniper CPU-based infrastructure that you stand up, you probably rent it for less than $1 billion. And so, because it's commoditized, there's already $1 trillion on the ground. What's the point of getting more? And so, the people who are clamoring to get this infrastructure, one, when they build out Hopper-based infrastructure and soon, Blackwell-based infrastructure, they start saving money.That's a tremendous return on investment. And the reason why they start saving money is because data processing saves money, and data processing is probably just a giant part of it already. And so, recommender systems save money, so on and so forth, OK? And so, you start saving money. The second thing is everything you stand up are going to get rented because so many companies are being founded to create generative AI.And so, your capacity gets rented right away and the return on investment of that is really good. And then the third reason is your own business. Do you want to either create the next frontier yourself or your own Internet services benefit from a next-generation ad system or a next-generation recommender system or a next-generation search system? So, for your own services, for your own stores, for your own user-generated content, social media platforms, for your own services, generative AI is also a fast ROI. And so, there's a lot of ways you could think through it.But at the core, it's because it is the best computing infrastructure you could put in the ground today. The world of general-purpose computing is shifting to accelerated computing. The world of human-engineered software is moving to generative AI software. If you were to build infrastructure to modernize your cloud and your data centers, build it with accelerated computing NVIDIA.Which really translates to:""We have no idea how you are going to make money with AI other than renting out the excess capacity. You are going to save money if you switch from general purpose compute to tensor multiplication compute, so that we can make money. All we're doing is selling you shovels, whether you're digging gold or your own grave is your problem. Do like startups or something, IDK.""",4,0.541,NEGATIVE,0.769
