There are ETFs domiciled in Europe that have similar names and track similar indexes, but they are not the same ETF fund. Many countries have restrictions or tax weirdness around owning funds domiciled in different countries.e.g., Americans can buy the VOO fund, whereas Europeans might buy the VUSA fund. VOO is a fund domiciled in the USA, and VUSA is a fund domiciled in Ireland. They both track the S&P500 and would be expected to perform similarly, but they are not the same fund.",3,0.52,1.0,NEGATIVE
