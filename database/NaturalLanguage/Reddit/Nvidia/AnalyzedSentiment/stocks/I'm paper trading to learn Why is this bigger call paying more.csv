,"I'm trying to learn everything about trades and options. Reading as many books as I can. Anyways I added an NVIDIA call at 945 on 3/22 and for some reason the profit it shows is only 400.

There is intrinsic value and the time value. If a call strike is above current share price then there is no intrinsic value. That call has no intrinsic value, because no one would exercise those calls and buy NVDA for that strike when they could buy it at market price. Your breakeven price is the call strike + premium paid for the option. 945+ 22.6= 967Stop doing this, buy SPY and go live your life. You’ll end up with more money and happiness ",0,0.541,0.81,NEGATIVE

Football subs are a great example because everyone talks Tom Brady news but no one in there is dumb enough to think they could become Tom Brady by studying playbooks. Stocks are such a rare example in this world: 1. put in no effort, get maximal returns. 2. People think they could become the next Tom BradyIf you put in 1/10 mental effort (buy SPY) you will get life changing returns. But the moment you start putting in 2+/10 mental effort, you actually start performing worse and becoming more miserable. Unless you’re the Tom Brady of trading.

There are 4 Greeks. The main 2 however are Delta, and Theta. In rough terms Delta is now much the option will increase in price as it goes closer to or further in the money. Theta is how fast the option will decay over time. So in rough terms, the higher strike has a higher Delta and that is why it increased more and the lower strike has a higher Theta means it will have to move more in the same amount of time to overcome the time decay. The Greeks change and time passes and the underlying stock moves also. It can get complicated but basically a higher Delta will gain more on a small price move.Do some research on “the Greeks”.",0,0.54,0.997,NEGATIVE
,"I'm trying to learn everything about trades and options. Reading as many books as I can. Anyways I added an NVIDIA call at 945 on 3/22 and for some reason the profit it shows is only 400. Yet the 950 call I did yesterday is profiting 500? Can someone explain why and how that works? Wouldn't 945 give me more money since anything north of that price is more profit than anything north of 950?

As the stock price goes higher than your strike, your delta gets closer to 1.0, and the call acts more like shares. There are strategies where you buy deep ITM calls instead of shares.The other major piece of information here is what we're the metrics when you added the 945 vs. the 950. To get big call movements, you would want to get far OTM calls. They would be cheap because likelihood is not favorable, then as price meets that strike that call would move more than if you bought a closer strike.Lastly Breakeven Price only matters if you plan to exercise a call. Breakeven is saying the price the stock needs to be for the underlying 100 shares to ""break even"" against the premium you paid for the call.",0,0.537,0.999,NEGATIVE

As a result, 950 call options may show higher profits even if the price of NVIDIA stock fluctuates similarly.Time decay: The value of an option declines over time, especially as the expiration date approaches. Since the 950 call option was added recently (3/22), it has less time decay than the 945 call option that was added earlier.Timing of Entry: Market conditions at the time of entry, such as volatility levels, news events, or overall sentiment, can affect the profitability of an option position.",0,0.537,0.995,NEGATIVE

You made money because the probability went up (because the stock moved closer)The options that are further away from the current price yield more. Because you take more risk. The gamma is biggest around 0.25 delta. This means that options near 0.25 delta scale the fastest on a big move.,0,0.527,0.996,NEGATIVE
