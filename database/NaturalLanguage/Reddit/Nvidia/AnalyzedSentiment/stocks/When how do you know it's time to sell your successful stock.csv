,"Hey. When it comes to huge companies, like Amazon, Nvidia and others, it's obvious you can and should keep their stocks when they give you significant profits, say, 11% in a month (unless there is something obvious that could crumble them ofc). But what about smaller companies that ppl find full of potential? I bought Celestica Inc. (CLS) stocks like a month ago. It's already given me about 15% (after yesterday's strong earnings report). I read articles where this company is stated promising etc, but I'd like to know when it is the best time to sell.

""We would sell if we needed money for something else -- I would reluctantly sell something terribly cheap to buy something even cheaper,"" said Buffett. This doesn't happen to Berkshire too often these days -- after all, the company has more than $100 billion in cash.The second, and more common, reason Buffett sells stocks is because of changing fundamentals, or a changing competitive landscape. As Buffett said:We sell really when we think we're reevaluating the economic characteristics of the business. We probably had one view of the long-term competitive advantage of the company at the time we've bought it, and we may have modified that. That doesn't mean that we think the company is going into some disasterous period, or anything like that. We think McDonald's has a fine future, we think Disney has a fine future, and there are others. But we don't think their competitive advantage is as strong as we thought it was when we initially made the decision.Bad reasons to sell - To be thorough, there are some bad reasons to sell a stock that investors should avoid. These include, but aren't necessarily limited to:Because the stock's price plunged: This is perhaps the worst possible reason to sell a stock. If your original reasons for buying still apply, and the price has gone down significantly, it should be looked at as an opportunity to buy, not to sell.Because the stock's price increased sharply: I've been guilty of this one a few times, and at first, this might not sound like a bad reason to sell. For example, I sold Tesla after shares roughly tripled from its IPO price, even though all signs were pointing toward dramatically improved vehicle sales and a path to long-term profitability. In the years since, shares have increased another 300% or so from where I sold it.Because a billionaire sold: This applies even if that billionaire is named Warren Buffett. Now, if a billionaire sells a stock, it could be a good time to do a little digging and find out why. However, I'm saying that you shouldn't sell just because a billionaire did. For example, I mentioned that Buffett sold some Goldman Sachs a couple years ago, but a little research would show that this was mainly to finance an acquisition rather than because of fears about the stock itself.https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/05/16/how-warren-buffett-decides-its-time-to-sell-a-stoc.aspx",0,0.559,NEGATIVE,1.0

It is a bit of financial and sector analysis and a lot of faith and belief in the company.To find new stocks, there are many techniques: read the news and check the name on Yahoo fin or something like that; come to reddit and read what people are talking about; go on r/WSB and do the opposite; check the S&P500 and Nasdaq listing. All you need is something you like enough, believe in enough and have some knowledge about their work. I don't buy hype, I don't buy trend, which makes me miss a lot sometimes: Tesla earnings for example.Right now, ASML dropped 15% because of bad earnings. I know that they are the only company that makes the necessary machinery to produce the microchips. My prediction is:1-ASML won't go bankrupt2- ASML will bounce back +50% in a year or less3- I will invest in it and wait a yearYou need to decide how much you want to invest and for how long.In case of any doubt, investing in a generalised ETF for 10-20 years is the correct way. r/bogleheadsThis is also why I don't trade crypto the same way.

This is the wrong question, because nobody knows really.The questions are rather: what is your investing strategy? How do you minimize risk? What are your investing goals? What is your risk tolerance? What is your investment horizon?By asking these kind of questions you don't become a gambler, but a real investor. Real investors are ready to lose XX% of their portfolio value for the chance to gain XX% of value.My example:I am mostly a high risk, long term investor by investing mainly in tesla (accumulating and holding), with a good chunk of palantir (only holding, will buy if it drops) and some smaller positions in chinese stocks and penny-stocks.I am willing to lose 100% of my portfolio value for the chance to gain XXX00% in value.I am also a really small high risk day trader (atm profits and losses equalize each other). I will stop day trading when I lost my gamble money.I am also a longterm and high risk investor in certificates that track the value of private equity AI Companies.I am also a bad example.My plan is, now that i have invested a good amount, to build some cash reserves to be able to hop on opportunities like in a market crash (since i will most likely be loosing everything i invested in this case).So my investment horizon is long, between 2-30 years. I evaluate, if i want to sell a stock by the fundamentals and the potential i see for this company. I will take profits on the way there. I'll take profits, if they are significant to me.I minimize risk by buying puts when I think the market is risky (hedging).Edit 1+2: adding information & spelling",0,0.541,NEGATIVE,1.0

Such a thing would be, ""AI didn't work and mass adoption was made impossible because of legislation"", now I sell and collect my years of gains.The second account is everything else. In this account, I may buy something because I believe in the next few quarters. When those earnings raise value, I will sell when I hit my price target. I may buy a short trade. I might buy something simply on momentum and sell when it breaks that trend. In all cases, I set a condition for a trim or sale prior to buying and hold that discipline.Edit for clarity: I have two separate accounts so I don't confuse two positions in the same company. I have Apple in both, for example. One is to hold for the long haul. The other may just be trading dips and news.
