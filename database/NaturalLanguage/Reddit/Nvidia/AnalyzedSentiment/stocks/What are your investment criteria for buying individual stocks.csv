,"Out of curiosity, how do you typically decide whether to buy a stock? Do you rely on valuations (DCF, DDM, comparable companies analysis) or simply review financial statements?

Is there anything else you consider? Edit: updated what I meant by valuation","I believe making complicated models and adding more data will give you a false sense of confidence that your valuation is accurate. I think that's because people believe effort is correlated to quality.I understand that my answer seems the most unreasonable.The most important thing I consider is whether the company fits into my long-term vision of the future. See how bad it sounds? My vision could be completely wrong. And it's not quantitative.An analogy would be cooking. Two people can be given the same cooking recipe. The world-class chef sees in their mind what they want the end product to look like, and they've cooked many times before, so they know what works and what doesn't. Their finished product is spectacular. The beginner that follows the recipe, or instructions from a world-class chef will have a finished product that is completely different and likely far from spectacular.This is the hardest thing to communicate to investors because the only difference between vision and a delusional nutjob is the end result.5 years ago,Intel had net income of 21B and market cap 224B - now 133BAMD had net income of 0.3B and market cap of 33B - now 226B (I sold this already)NVDA had income of 2.8B and market cap of 102B.How do you justify NVDA or AMD as investments at the time? NVDA revenues declined 5 years ago whereas INTC revenues increased. AMD revenues increased by less than 4% YoY.Quantitatively, INTC seems like the best investment 5 years ago.But it was NVDA and AMD that crushed the SP500 while INTC massively underperformed.How do you explain that to someone? How do you tell them it's how the company lines up with how you see the future when no one can predict the future? You can't. But that's the answer.",0,0.548,1.0,NEGATIVE

Ask a PC hardware nerd even 5 years ago and they’d tell you that Intel was slowly getting trounced by AMD in the consumer CPU market. Their Threadripper enterprise chips were a big hit as well and a much better value than anything Intel was producing. Simply takes time to claw away market share from a legacy behemoth like Intel.With Nvidia it was a lot harder to read the tea leaves. While they were already dominant in the GPU space, they benefited from massive tailwinds in the form of cryptocurrency mining and then the AI craze.My point is that most people who do surface level research or DCF models have a pretty poor understanding of the companies themselves and the actual products they sell.",1,0.542,1.0,NEGATIVE

Like if I'm nervous about the future or I think my portfolio is running on the risky side, I might be looking at leaders in more boring market sectors. When things go poorly (e.g. 2022), I might be looking for deals.The harder part for me is figuring out when/how to get out.Not buying a stock isn't really a mistake, it's a non-event. There's always that company you didn't buy. What matters is how well you do on what you buy. So in your scenario, the mistake would have been buying intel.
