Source: https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/aapl-all-time-high-wwdc-2024/","I'm also happy. I just limited out on AAPU near its current levels (34) this morning when I was sleeping, sticking with my self-imposed restriction of only rarely holding levered funds for a very short period of time when I have a very good reason. I'm holding my normal apple shares that I bought pre-earnings over a month ago, after being uncharacteristically out of apple for more than a year. The content of WWDC was completely in line with my expectations with the exception that I forgot that apple doesn't do hardware announcements at WWDC and they are pretty secretive in general. I do still think that Apple AI will run TSMC LLM ASIC inference chips on Apple Silicon in the cloud but I could be wrong. I was watching WWDC on my vision pro (brought to me by, in part, by historical gains in Apple stock) and watching a separate window tracking AAPU's ~4% declines and feeling like other traders were watching a different stream.Over the last months I've also read a lot of comments made by people dragging Apple as a buy, and a lot of comments by people who are either angry or mystified over this week's apple gains, so I thought I would write an essay breaking all the reasons for the rally.First off, Apple hasn't had revenue growth for well over a year, and its growth has been tepid for two years. Obviously, you want to own companies that are growing when they are growing, so Apple's stock price was stagnant or down over the last 18 months, while it was entirely discounted as an AI player while the AI chip stocks and AI-branded Mag 7 players ran away (with the exception of Tesla). At the very least, the street is now expecting positive iPhone growth this year, which is the dominant source of Apple's revenue, as its 2 billion+ users begin to upgrade. I personally don't expect Apple to blow us out of the park next earnings, but I do expect consistent and steady growth in iPhone purchases. I'm pissed that I have to upgrade to test the new Siri on a phone, but AAPU more than paid for that this week. After WWDC, I held AAPU until this morning, expecting that dedicated analysts would make their case to fund managers as to while WWDC was actually a big deal, despite the initial sell-off.I think Nvida is best positioned to monetize B2B AI on both the hardware and software front (with NIMs and other software/LLM bundle and omniverse digital twin offerings, while I'm ST bearish on the overvalued software sector as a whole). But, I think that Apple is best positioned to capitalize on consumer-facing AI (again, with 2 billion+ users). Most people don't need AI that can one-shot hundreds of lines of code (which AI can't do now, but will be able to do in the future). Most of those 2 billion people need AI give short, confidential, and accurate answers to quick questions (which Apple AI will do this year) and act as an assistant (make three different cost-effective itineraries for a trip and execute on all the purchases for one with an okay, pull up all the news or websites that I will find interesting this morning based on my past behavior), which will happen soon-ish.At WWDC, Apple subtly laid out their case of how they are moving forward with AI, which aligns with what a lot of experts have been calling for over the last year. This is that you have your own private on-device AI and own private Apple cloud AI, which interacts with other apps and websites, which will increasingly run using AI agents and novel LLMs, on your behalf. For most people, especially younger generations that are very locked into the Apple ecosystem, the amount of time they use their meat sticks on phones and keyboards will dramatically decrease. Yeah, Microsoft can do this too. But, Microsoft has a very long and problematic relationship with on-device privacy, starting with Windows 10, and progressively getting worse since then. If your AI knows you and is doing stuff for you, you want to be able to trust it. You don't want it to tell Microsoft, Meta, or Google all your pressure points that will result in you making a purchase. These three companies are all in the personal data-broker business, where all your data is supposed to be anonymized, but a programmer with a budget who knows anything about you can know almost everything about you. You also don't want personal AI to cause problems for you while acting as you on your behalf. Also, the difference between great AI software and pretty good software can be huge if you know that the software will inevitably make mistakes and do things that you don't want it to do. At WWDC, apple laid out their business model for the next decade, and it is clear that they are serious and have put a lot of work into it.With regard to stocks, future performance will depend entirely on the monetization of AI. Apple can and will monetize AI through their new effort in many different ways. We don't know what Apple's current deal with Open AI is, but it is important to remember that Google pays Apple to use their search. Google turns this finders fee into ad revenue. As AI becomes more accurate and its critical thinking ability improves with retrieval augmented generation, which is critical for accuracy and reducing hallucinations that make AI a b*llshit machine if you ask it a truly complex multi-part question and is critical for an AI managing an OS. Apple will own 2 billion+ eyeballs and they can decide how they monetize those eyeballs and how much they want to make per eyeball at their leisure.Whether or not they are currently using ASICs, Apple's official entrance into the AI cloud is a really big deal. Particularly, Apple can capitalize on its decades-long role as one of TSMC's most important customers. Through 2026, four companies have reserved the bulk of TSMC's entire 3 nm production line those companies are NVDA, AMD, Qualcomm, and Apple.](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/06/11/news-major-clients-reportedly-fully-allocate-tsmcs-production-capacity-until-2026-3nm-process-in-high-demand/) Right now, if you are a different company or startup that wants to use the best technology to run your AI, you have to go through one of those four players, be satisfied with lower-scale or older-tech production, or wait until 2027 to start production and 2028 to launch. In AI years, 3-4 years is an eternity. We already know the players that will compete at the highest level between now and then, and Apple is one of them, thanks to their historically close relationship with TSM. Apple has been an AI player the entire time the stock was sleeping, and this week, the catch-up trade went into high gear. Apple doesn't hype all the great things that it plans to do to juice share prices, Tim Cook only reports on what Apple has already done in secret (though Apple is a leaky ship, so you can know a lot about what they are trying to do in secret of you read all the macrumors sites and cross-reference different rumors posted at different times for consistency).These are the reasons why apple stock went up. People like me waited a year from the last WWDC to make a big bet before this WWDC. The lion's share of my portfolio, in order, is NVDA, TSMC, and AAPL.With regard to how long to hold aggressive positions and when to get taxed on profits, I am super sensitive to major Mag-7 level companies notably cutting back on spending, or accelerating their layoffs. I am hoping these indicators will give me a month or so to load up on dry powder/go conservative. I will also keep an eye out for signs of absolutely imminent trouble with China, which would also crash almost all stocks everywhere. With NVDA, I am also on the alert for any reports of Blackwell water cooling failures. Water cooling is really hard to implement, especially when water pressure can't shut off for years, and leaks can't happen for years, or there will be disastrous financial consequences. I've been through many crashes, and it is critical that you watch the biggest customers of your biggest positions to see verifiable trouble ahead. But, I think I stick to evidence based investment with regards to taking profits, and I don't see evidence yet.There is a lot of talk on CNBC about Cisco's crash after the dot-com bubble. I used to own Cisco. There were plenty of warning signs. Cisco's biggest customers were WorldCom, Sprint, and AT&T when it had massive year-over-year revenue growth. Two of those companies are no more. WorldCom was an Enron-scale case of outright fraud and they were buying Cisco routers to keep up appearances. Sprint over-extended its Cisco purchases. These stocks hit their highs months before Cisco hit its high. Cisco had tepid 15% YoY growth, down from massive revenue growth, the month it crashed. If NVDA's YoY growth goes from very positive to mildly positive, then that is really bad at these valuations, because trends in revenue growth have significant correlations, and going from great growth to okay growth can signal an inflection into a decline. So, I'm not going to try to get out at or before the top, I am going to wait until earnings numbers come in before running for the hills and rotating into bond proxies with good dividend yield.",2,0.547,NEGATIVE,0.679

I'm not an expert, and will never know more than the industry leading algorithms and those in the field, so I'm more focused on the underlying themes. Whether it's AI or machine learning or automation or whatever, what I know is that Apple is not the loudest or the first in the room. Who knows what happens in their product brainstorms and what's the focus on their roadmaps - they've done a good job of keeping things under wraps and also don't announce things unless they're ready. But when they announce - they don't fail. They embed it into their ecosystem, they ensure it works, and make it accessible to the masses. Until I see signs that their culture has changed, or that they start skipping steps in their rollouts, there's no reason to think Apple won't be quietly making smart moves and adapting to the latest while everyone else is announcing layoffs and stock buybacks, and making abstract promises about the latest technology trend.This news combined AI integration all while guaranteeing sales for their next 5 iterations of iphones and other key idevices at a time when people were thinking their devices have peaked.
