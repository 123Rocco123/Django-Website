,"Nvidia shares were under pressure Monday after a Chinese regulator said it was investigating the chipmaker over possible violations to the country’s antimonopoly law. Shares slipped about 2% before the bell. The State Administration for Market Regulation opened an investigation into the chipmaker in relation to acquisition of Mellanox, the Chinese government said Monday. “In recent days, due to Nvidia’s suspected violation of China’s anti-monopoly law and the State Administration for Market Regulation’s restrictive conditions around Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox shares ... the State Administration for Market Regulation is opening a probe into Nvidia in accordance with law,” according to a statement translated by CNBC. Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The news comes as competition heats up between the U.S. and China over chipmaking capabilities, with the Biden administration last week announcing a final slew of curbs targeting semiconductor toolmakers. The U.S. has amped up restrictions on chip sales to the second-largest economy in recent years, barring Nvidia and other key semiconductors from selling their most advanced AI chips in an effort to limit the country from strengthening its military. The company has worked to create new products to sell in China that abide by the U.S. regulations. Shares of the AI chip darling have outperformed this year, rallying nearly 188% as investors ramp up bets on the sector more than two years after ChatGPT’s initial debut. Shares have also helped push the market the market to new highs, along with the broader technology sector.

Shares slipped about 2% before the bell. The State Administration for Market Regulation opened an investigation into the chipmaker in relation to acquisition of Mellanox, the Chinese government said Monday. “In recent days, due to Nvidia’s suspected violation of China’s anti-monopoly law and the State Administration for Market Regulation’s restrictive conditions around Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox shares ... the State Administration for Market Regulation is opening a probe into Nvidia in accordance with law,” according to a statement translated by CNBC. Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The news comes as competition heats up between the U.S. and China over chipmaking capabilities, with the Biden administration last week announcing a final slew of curbs targeting semiconductor toolmakers. The U.S. has amped up restrictions on chip sales to the second-largest economy in recent years, barring Nvidia and other key semiconductors from selling their most advanced AI chips in an effort to limit the country from strengthening its military. The company has worked to create new products to sell in China that abide by the U.S. regulations. Shares of the AI chip darling have outperformed this year, rallying nearly 188% as investors ramp up bets on the sector more than two years after ChatGPT’s initial debut. Shares have also helped push the market the market to new highs, along with the broader technology sector.

When you go after NVIDIA is about attempting to affect the US Stock market and leverage it as negotiation for Trump, i.e. XI WANTS MONEEE his ideologically (experts would say idiosyncratic or pathological) centrally managed crapconomy is not doing well... Unfortunately for Chairman Xi, this air fist will fizzle for several reasons. They utterly do not get market forces, free markets or even thinking (to cite Cai Xia, defector, who described XI very well). NVIDIA is simply too big and does not need China for advanced chips- it needs TWN. Two, he picked the timing wrong, the Santa Rally. With AVGO poised to report as well as the other AI on track news for December, the AI sector will stabilize. Third, Xi picked (by sheer coincidence) the head and shoulder's NVIDIA resistance point, and if the stock does not go to <100, Xi's move would have tripled failed. 110-120 it is a too good of a discount and everyone buys more... Oh they forgot Jensen in Taiwanese...They clearly picked NVIDIA for a reason (vs Apple) but it will simply fizzle as a maneuver. It is interesting speaking with Chinese friends, as in all relatives there ""We aall fraid! Hi take all da monee! we lose money bank we lose mone real estate"" and ""Halth costs monee the system is bad."" Something has the Chinese buyer spooked, for good reason. Hey you guys recall what he did to Apple? Tim Cook had to fly meet and made billions, BILLIONS in concessions! Ali Baba was just ransacked, so running out of victims to shake, why not NVIDIA? And how stupid one ought to be, just months after trying to convince ""Comback! Jina is safe to invest"" they pull this stuff on the BIGGEST tech company in the world.",0,0.534,NEGATIVE,1.0
