Thank you","Would it be smart to buy 10-20 shares each of: nvidia, apple, microsoft, amazon, google, etcNVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, and GOOG/GOOGL already make up 31% of the net assets of the S&P 500 index (SPLG/VOO/SPY) and 40% of the net assets of the NASDAQ 100 index (QQQ/QQQM), so if all you want to do is own mega cap tech stocks you might as well just buy the S&P 500 index or the NASDAQ 100 for simplicity.One of the advantages of buying individual stocks is buying high performers that aren't among those well-known names, or aren't even in the big index ETFs.

Looking at rolling 120 month periods starting in January 1928, 93% of those rolling 120 month periods had positive gains. In other words, if you invested in the stock market for 10 years starting in any month since January 1928, there is a 93% chance you made money.https://winthropwealth.com/commentary/how-has-the-sp-500-historically-performed-over-10-year-periods/",4,0.557,POSITIVE,0.728

Would it be smart to buy 10-20 shares each of: nvidia, apple, microsoft, amazon, google, etc (big names that should be around for a long time)? Any other stock recommendations for long term growth? Thank you","I would agree that Intel could have a good future ahead of them but they need to start innovating. They pretty much fumble the ball every time they get it. Even right now their primary business plan isn’t to innovate it is to build chips for the actual innovators. They will not be bigger than Nvidia because they hope to be one of the companies that Nvidia hires to build their AI chips. Intel built PC and Laptop chips, this was a great business but now most people do not even use laptops or PC’s. Instead they use their phones. When Apple introduced their first iphone this should have been Intels cue to start working on mobile chips. They didn’t. They continued building PC chips, this was a terrible decision. Today we have AI and again, Intel just sits around and waits for someone to give them a job. If Intel were in the beverage industry, I would picture them as being the company that produces the plastic bottles. They only do jobs that are contracted to them and honestly I think contracts will dwindle down because there are other options aside from Intel for companies that need chips built. On the positive side, Intel has been researching Quantum computing this could be promising, however I think they should halt or severely reduce all dividend payments and focus as much resources into this as possible. Otherwise, they will lose the race again.",1,0.541,NEGATIVE,1.0

Thank you","Interesting analysisThe new ceo realized they lost the chip warHe did a great thing and pivotedThey are building 4 chip plants in the US and guess what ( will always be protected by US government for National security supply chain reasons because no one else can do chips except Taiwan semi on a scale that is needed )They are also building one in IrelandThey do have some chips and can offer consumers and businesses a lower cost entry point if that entity has different needs then running the top of the line 75% margin chips Nvidia and amd sellsThey do not need to be bigger then NvidiaLook at intel’s market capThey can grow really really nicely for a very long time and only hit half of NvidiaIntel Is at a bottom right nowVery easy for them to consistently climb from a very long time especially with all the seeds Pat G has already plantedNvidia has much different path and has already performed in an amazing way = future growth in revenue and earnings and price will be difficultIntel has failed for years but is now in the middle of a super turn around with tens of billions investedWith the AI buzz and more tech coming chips will be even more important and I see a future where both Taiwan semi and intel are at max production capacityThese plants take forever to set up and are a finite resource, chips will become more and more in demand then even now and we saw how a slight disruption like Covid in the supply chain stoped a lot of production due to lack of chipsThe future for Intel is brightOnly 2 types of investors exist for Intel right nowThe ones who are holding these levels with 💎🙌 cause they see that future and the ones who go off old Info, do not understand the changes PG has made and don’t understand its future.I like the stock for a consistent climb long term which is what the OP’s question wasIt’s also one of the safest stocks right now cause even in a market wise and sector pullback Intel is the only one in the space that isn’t over valued or over boughtSo a lot of cash flow can go into it in those scenariosJust my opinionNot stock adviceI like trivia and simply answered the OP’s question",2,0.536,POSITIVE,0.81

Thank you","You are right there is potential, in fact I do own 5 shares of Intel in hopes that they do win at least one race. But I do consider them to be a little more risky. With US government help they may be able to win and they are the best US based chip company set to benefit from government spending. But on the other hand, can they be price competitive by producing chips in the US? This remains to be seen.",3,0.558,POSITIVE,0.614

How long will it be before there is an oversupply of chips? How would intel fare if there was an oversupply and their chips already cost 25% more because they are made in the US?",3,0.548,NEGATIVE,0.995

Thank you","I´m not too sure about this but i dont think labor costs play that much part in overall chip costs.Those fab are damn expensive, but Intel got large subsidies here. They also have fabs in Israel, Irealand and planned in Germany for wich they will get 10 billion subsidy from German State.So in the end, will it really be such a large cost disadvantage?Also, just out of strategic considerations, companies might want to give some business to intel so they have an alternative source if not for fear of conflict in east asia, then for better negotiation position with TSMC.Currently, TSMC cant even fulfill all requests.I dont know, what do you think?BTW, here is an interesting document about the whole value-chain, little outdated, but mostly accurate as far as i can tell:https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/58112/220712-the-semiconductor-ecosystem-global-features-and-europe-s-position.pdf",4,0.528,NEGATIVE,1.0
