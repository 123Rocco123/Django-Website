,"So I have 3 Nvidia calls: 160 11/29, 150 11/29, and 150 1/17/25. P/L on the three is about even and got the 160 a few days ago on a dip trying to make a few bucks betting on earnings driving the price up. As we all saw they crushed earnings and the stock moved up a few points. What im confused about is the value of my contracts dropped pretty significantly at open although the stock was up. Ive been trading options here and there for the past couple years and seen some “odd” action before but nothing like that. Seems completely opposite what youd expect, can some explain why that happened? Not particularly pressed, a little disappointed cuz i wanted to sell the 160 at open but just confused.",IV crush.,0,0.502,NEGATIVE,0.997

Is that a valid assumption?",1,0.507,NEGATIVE,0.515

For Nvidia, the rise and fall in implied volatility around earnings is much higher than typical stocks.No. The value of the premiums was increased around earnings. Based on your post, I assume you bought your contracts close to ER.",2,0.565,NEGATIVE,0.996

I knew volatility played a part in the value equation, didn’t realize a swing could negate an upward movement.Ya learn something new everyday lol",3,0.531,NEGATIVE,1.0

I could be wrong, as im just learning about IV crush lol, but I would imagine the IV of ETFs doesn’t fluctuate as much as stocks like Nvidia.I mentioned times I found price movement “odd” and looking back it was probably, at least in part due to that.Also, this clears up something i’ve been confused about for a while. I understand that some people take profits around earnings, but I wondered why stocks that the market seemed to like, crushed estimates, and provided good guidance, dropped after earnings. Knowing that IV crush is a thing makes it make more sense now, although ofc its not the only/main factor for the drop in price.",5,0.527,POSITIVE,0.965
