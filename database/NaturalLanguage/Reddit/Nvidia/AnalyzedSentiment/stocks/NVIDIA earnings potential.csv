,"Hey, I wanted to ask wider community if it might or might not be a good idea to invest into NVIDIA buy cfds before the report and sell them after the market opens the next day.

Google earnings were quite good and they dropped 5% on the next day and kept going down for a while.Sometimes it’s just not logic, so for that reason, entering a position just for the “ earnings effect “ it’s like casino in my opinion.You better be able to hold your position if it comes down -10% anytime soon. If you cannot, don’t enter.",0,0.531,1.0,NEGATIVE

Don't get me wrong, I understand setting sights high, but I think people expect certain companies to make more and more money endlessly.

If you have a company like NVDA that has been in the spotlight the whole year and we all know is making a ton of money, whether they beat expectation by 500 million or many billions, it doesn’t really matter, the questions about the company are not gonna be answered in the next or even the next two earnings. Now if you have another company that has POTENTIAL to earn a lot of money but has not yet and they have a lot of questions surrounding their chances of growing revenue enough or becoming profitable and they beat expectations then that stock has a much higher chance of shooting upwards because that earnings answers some of the questions",4,0.599,0.999,NEGATIVE
