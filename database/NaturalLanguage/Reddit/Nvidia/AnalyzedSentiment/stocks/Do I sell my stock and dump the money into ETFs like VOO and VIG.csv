,"My YTD return on my portfolio is currently 12.6% compared to VOO at 21.81% or VIG at 15.79%. I am a long-term investor and my thesis for each stock still holds strong, but I am certainly drawn to the higher returns and diversification in ETFs. Should I maintain my current holdings and continue to dump future money into ETFs or just sell now, and put all of the money into ETFs?

The possibility that you belong to the people permanently underperforming the market is high.What I can recommend though is balancing ETFs according to the current market. For example: in mid this year, small caps where lacking the market. The Russell 2000 had the worst half year compared to the S&P500 EVER. Furthermore, it's evident that small caps profit more off of a economic upswing. In such a scenario, it could make sense to rotate from an S&P500 ETF to a Russell 2000 ETF, for example. You're still invested in the broad market but balance it out according to the current market.",0,0.556,NEGATIVE,1.0

I'm much lower, but I'd say for you, given you don't feel confident in your investments, look at that option. You have sectors that aren't exactly flying off the shelf right now. Personally, I'd keep NVDA, AXP, and AMZN, sell the others, and buy MSFT and AAPL, maybe some GOOG(L). I will also advocate WM as they have continual growth and acquisitions. Those are safer stocks that are well-positioned for the future; although AAPL kind of worries me on a 5-year outlook.Look at what VOO holds the most. Tap into those for possible higher returns. Your other stocks are in a shaky situation right now. You can DCA into VOO or drop a little on the other stocks here and there.",0,0.538,POSITIVE,0.89
