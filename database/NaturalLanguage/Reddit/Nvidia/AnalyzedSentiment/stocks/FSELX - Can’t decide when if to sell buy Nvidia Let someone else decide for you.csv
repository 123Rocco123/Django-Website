Growth funds or blue chip funds etc.Nvidia is reaching Tulip levels of hype and even though it’ll earn and grow a lot it’s most likely a couple of earnings reports down the line will deflate not only this stock but the whole sector. People keep saying CPU are a cyclical asset so once there’s a little pull back in demand people will freak that it’s the time to sell asap.So I doubt the manager of that fund will be doing anything sort of fast to not loose steam quickly once nvidia goes down. So that’s the risk/issue. You could own a few specific cpu stocks like nvidia amd broadcome and Qualcomm plus TSM and in the event things look like a bubble burst then you can sell rather quickly or at least a portion.,0,0.528,0.999,NEGATIVE
