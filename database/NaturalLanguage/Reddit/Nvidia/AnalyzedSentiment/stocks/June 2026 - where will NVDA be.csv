,"I was looking at the option chain of NVDA, to hedge my portfolio. Current P/E, P/S and most metrics point to stellar growth expectations. If that's the case, why is $200 Call for June 2026 priced 'just' at $15. $240 Call (double of current price) is trading at $10. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Options Chain - Yahoo Finance It's an almost certainty that NVDA should double in next 18 months, or even sooner. So why wouldn't someone just get this option for $10, and free up his $110 capital for something else? I know, the option can become worthless if price stays below $240. But if I am getting into something as volatile as NVDA, I'm looking to 2X my capital; and not 'normal' 20-30% gains.

These are Nvidia’s primary customers. Google already eliminated Nvidia GPUs and use their own in house TPUs for all their model training and inference. Amazon has Trainium and Inferentia chips. Microsoft has their Maia chip. Meta has their MTIA chip. Tesla has Dojo. Apple has their on-device chips and is rumored to be getting into data center. Then you have AMD, Cerebras and Groq. These companies have the deepest pockets in the world and technical savvy to compete with Nvidia and Google has proven that. And Nvidia doesn’t actually make anything so the other big techs can also go to TSMC and Broadcom to have them manufacture their chips like Nvidia does. Even if these companies don’t completely eliminate their reliance on Nvidia they will offset demand and Nvidia prices could come down and profit margins erode in a big way.GenAI doesn’t live up to the hype and the productivity gains in real business applications don’t match the capital being spent on it.Models stop scaling on the training side and start scaling on the inference side (like GPT-o1) and Nvidia GPUs lose their advantage when all that matters is low power and cheap inference. Alternatively, smaller language models and local on device inference become the priority.Some hyperscalers stop upgrading every year and Nvidia growth stalls. They hit a ceiling on the number of GPUs sold per year. This also means that there is less competition for those GPUs so the price per unit comes down and profit margins compress.",0,0.545,POSITIVE,0.623
