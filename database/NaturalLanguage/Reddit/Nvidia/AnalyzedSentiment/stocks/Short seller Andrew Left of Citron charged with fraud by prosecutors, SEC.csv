Honestly I dont know about laws to see how this could be illegal other than maybe accounting fraud by being invoiced for a different service assuming he also believed in what he published.B) He exited his trades within minutes of releasing his view on the stock, usually after the stock moved 10% in the direction he suggested, even though he usually said that his target price for the stocks was 50-100% up/down from current price.His strategy, according to the report was: 1)So if a stock was $100 he shorted $Xmillion2)Publish report saying stock should really be trading at $45.3) Exit his short position 10 minutes after he publishes the info when the stock was at $90. And profited $10per share.4)Publicly said that he still has a short position and wont sell until $45 after already covered and has 0 exposure to the stock.I am not 100% sure why he would still say he hasnt covered after he did, as it seems to not matter at all to him (maybe he felt it added credibility). So his main thing was saying a stock is worth $X while in reality he did not believe it was worth as much.When he went long a stock the only thing that changed from his startegy was that he would buy before releasing his reports, and then immediately sell after tweeting at $110 even though he claims the stock is worth $200.",3,0.56,1.0,NEGATIVE

The meat of the ""Scheme"" is:""Knowing that Citron’s influence on the market was largely based on his personal reputation, defendant LEFT concealed the contributions of third parties, ...""Tough to argue a duty to disclose other parties helped prepare the commentary or had knowledge.""...LEFT concealed his intention to trade a Targeted Security in a manner inconsistent with the content and conclusions of Citron’s commentary by covering all or the majority of the positions he held in the Targeted Security shortly after the Citron commentary on the Targeted Security was published.""I've read his reports, they all include statements Citron goes short the target. Implication would be they cover at some point. The indictment makes a lot out of Citron using short dated options so they get out pretty quick (5 days in some examples).... So.... ?""...LEFT selected extreme target prices to attract media attention and provoke an immediate change to the prices of the Targeted Security while concealing his intention to exit all or the majority of the positions he held in the Targeted Security well before they reached -- if they ever did -- the target price selected. ""I've read his reports for years. I never once expected them to hold until the target price. And I'm not a short, have never shorted once, and one of my best investments ever was buying a short attack target after it went down a bunch.""...defendant LEFT also falsely represented that he did not share Citron’s commentary with hedge funds before the reports were published. In truth, defendant LEFT often provided third parties, including hedge funds, with advance notice of the anticipated publication of Citron’s commentary to enable the third parties to profit by trading around the comment""This is the first one I've seen that seems like an actual issue. But the indictment does not give specifics of what the statements were or where they were given. False statements would be bad. There are multiple accusations of false statements...Reading this is one of the worst quality indictments I've ever read. At one point they call him out for buying a stock, calling it good in a tweet, then selling it after it went up! How dare he! Apparently they expect one to only hold onto a stock once you've tweeted that you have bought some, or perhaps to go back and update the tweet.Then I did a double take here:""At approximately 2:08 p.m., defendant LEFT responded to an inquiry from CNBC concerning his position. Defendant LEFT wrote back to CNBC: “Yes I shorted some today Seems to be all retail driven without any fundamental basis.” Defendant LEFT’s statement was materially misleading because he had covered nearly his entire short position by this time.""I had to reread that several times. The message to CNBC was in the past tense and thus entirely correct. He had shorted some that day. The indictment seems to be making it out to be a a crime that he didn't specifically say in his brief text message ""shorted and then covered"", but even there when you say it in the past test ""I shorted some today"" it could easily include the act of shorting and covering. I have a lot of trouble seeing how this perhaps slightly imprecise or subject to possible misinterpretation text message rises to the level of Fraud.",0,0.52,1.0,NEGATIVE
