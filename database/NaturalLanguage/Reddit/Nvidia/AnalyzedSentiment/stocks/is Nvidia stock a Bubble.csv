I just think your reasons are based on a very limited view centered around LLM, but AI is so much more than LLM.We don’t often see “monetization” of AI in the form of revenues because the benefits are mostly captured as efficiency gains. What you see is massive investments in data centers by companies, not necessarily for the purpose of developing LLMs, but a broader set of AI applications meant to replace human tasks or enhance human capabilities. The result is reductions in personnel everywhere. This trend has been underway for quite some time now and has displaced a lot of technical jobs — it’s an old tale we’ve all heard about. While the trend is not new anymore, I believe there is still room for growth as many traditional industries are still lagging behind on AI adoption.LLM, along with generative AI, is the newer AI trend that is again driving further investments in data centers. The difference is that it’s now displacing creative jobs. Copywriter has literally become an obsolete profession overnight. I personally believe that there is a huge potential for growth there. The demand will likely continue as adoption of AI tools spread in creative fields, and the efficiency gains can be even more significant than in technical applications — imagine your favorite writer can now publish 10 books a year; blockbuster movies now cost less than a million to produce. Especially with image rendering and voice AI technologies… you don’t even need to have the actual actors on set (this is already a common practice in China btw). Here you do see many startups capitalizing on generative AI tools, and guess what? NVDA has already invested in quite a few of them.And the point about competition — there is a lot of proprietary technology and knowledge involved in chipmaking. If it were so easy to develop your own, TSMC would not [still] be making more than 50% of the world’s chips — everybody’s been trying to catch up to TSMC for as long as China wants to invade Taiwan lol. It’s literally the only thing that the Chinese has not been able to copy! I can only imagine the NVDA chips are even more sophisticated — not to mention there is already a whole ecosystem around their chips that’s widely adopted by developers.However, as far as the stock price goes, since US investors are largely driven by stuff that they hear on the news like the GPT releases, maybe just as you predicted, the stock will likely fall if the next version is underwhelming, for a little while.I would still hold my 300 shares, though. Just my [possibly biased] 2 cents.",1,0.534,NEGATIVE,0.978

I'll throw in that your assessment is limited to LLMs. I'd argue that LLMs are the very tip of the AI iceberg. The compute need for autonomous cars and potentially future robotics that need both the autonomous vision and LLMs will keep the AI market thriving for decades. Also all companies could use LLMs to improve the bottom line. Chat GPT happens to be a company that is solely in that space but their success or failure doesn't mean LLMs aren't valuable. Every call center will gladly reduce staff when LLMs are capable and affordable.There will certainly be uses that we aren't capable of thinking of yet. I think small companies will need access to LLMs but can't buy what Google, Amazon , Apple are from NVIDIA. This could create a service opportunity for NVIDIA to build out a model that provides their products on a smaller scale.In my mind competition is great unknown that could change everything for NVIDIA.",1,0.54,POSITIVE,0.992

AI has not exapnded productivity enough, in enough areas, to justify an *AI supplier* being worth 15% of the entire US economic output. How can a supplier that provides equipment used to develop tools that increase 20-30% of the workforces productitivty by 10-15% be itself more valuable than the yearly output of the entire sector.ChatGPT alone *costs* 36 cents PER MESSAGE to process. If you are improving the productivity of a $60,000 employee by 15%, that means you have a yearly budget, at break even, in a vacuum, of 25,000 messages (125 per day across 200 days) to make that transaction. Larger models are not reducing this cost.Not to mention, these marginal gains in productivity require all the slow moving market factors. The internet was worth trillions, just not 25 years ago. It will take 10 or 15 years for 30 somethings who have just gotten over facebook to care enough about their jobs to begrudgingly use this new stuff.",1,0.547,NEGATIVE,1.0
