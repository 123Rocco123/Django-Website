,"Hello all! A few weeks ago there was a bunch of news about several trades that Nancy. Here is an article about those trades. My question is specifically about here Broadcom(AVGO) options trade. I don't really trade options because I don't understand them. I like to think that I understand the basics, but maybe not. Anyway, the upcoming split is what confuses me about this. She bought 20 options calls with a strike price of $800. Does that she mean that she thinks the current price of AVGO, currently $1744 a share, will drop significantly from its current price? Or does she think it will rise significantly from the 10 to 1 split price? Again, the split is what confuses me.","Just gonna copy paste my previous commentassuming you want to enter the trade today, the 800C is selling for $980. Breakeven is 1780. So long as AVGO is above 1780 or 178 post split, you’ll make money. Another way to look at it is using the delta. The delta is almost 1 so it’s effectively 1:1 movement with stock. 100 shares of AVGO is 177,400. The contract itself is 98,000. So one contract is effectively 1.8x leverage.",0,0.539,1.0,NEGATIVE

She’s betting for AVGO but shes DEEP ITM so she still has the ability to Beat the market but if the market moves against her it won’t be as bad. Deeper ITM = Smaller profit margins Vs OTM options, but OTM is a lot riskier because it’s a lot easier to hit that Max loss.",0,0.527,0.881,NEGATIVE

However the same trade but with a 1250-1500C would Yield 60%+ off a modest 25% YOY AVGO gain. HOWEVER the breakeven is 5x Pelosi’s deep ITM call for barely over 2x profits.",1,0.54,1.0,NEGATIVE

Makes sense.So after looking up the different between ITM and OTM, because she is ITM, which means she can trade them immediately, she is expecting a short term gain from these options?Looking at what is in her portfolio it seems she doesn't actually hold an AVGO so she isn't hedging a bet.I was going to buy the split anyway. When I first saw the news was just curious if she knew something we didn't. Obviously these kinds of trades are a big tell.",1,0.523,0.999,NEGATIVE

She’s a long term Bull for AVGO but who knows!",2,0.522,0.996,NEGATIVE

Play needs to start moving by November tho. Hok Tan is Him. If you all look back at 2022 filings.. based on just 2022 projections fair value at 2022 earnings multiple was coming out $175.
