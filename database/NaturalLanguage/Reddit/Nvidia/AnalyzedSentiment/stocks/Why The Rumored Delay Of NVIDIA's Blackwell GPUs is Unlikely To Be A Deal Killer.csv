What is a worry is the repeat of the Year 2000 problem for Cisco and Juniper. Leading up to the rollover from 1999 to 2000 the world was worried computers would quit due to their clocks only having 2 digits for the year. So every company on Earth bought a ton of new and expensive equipment and the Internet was built out for years in a few months. Then 2000 rolled around and no problems. So all of the next 5-7 years of internet hardware capex had been pulled forward into 1999, so CSCO and JNPR's sales fell off a cliff.What if the AI hype has pulled the next 6-10 years worth of investment in expensive AI chips forward into 2024 and it turns out that AI (which likely is the next great thing, but like the internet not the next great thing immediately) is slow to actually show a profit to the consumers of those expensive AI chips and they don't buy anymore for some years? Then NVDA profits will crater and along with it their stock price.",0,0.571,NEGATIVE,1.0

,"https://www.chaotropy.com/why-the-rumored-delay-of-nvidias-blackwell-gpus-is-unlikely-to-be-a-deal-killer/ From the article: [ But even if there is a design flaw, it is most likely the interconnect between two Blackwell GB100s to a GB200. This would mean that the individual Blackwell GPUs are not affected. It has already been reported here that problems with this interconnect could lead to production delays of two weeks. However, such problems are not uncommon when starting production of a new, highly complex product like the GB200, and are usually resolved in a short period of time, resulting in an improved product. For the above reasons, I think it's unlikely that ""The Information""'s report uncovered a relevant problem at NVIDIA. No complex product has ever been rolled out at scale without at least some minor problems during development or production. ]",Source - trust me bro,1,0.51,POSITIVE,0.995
