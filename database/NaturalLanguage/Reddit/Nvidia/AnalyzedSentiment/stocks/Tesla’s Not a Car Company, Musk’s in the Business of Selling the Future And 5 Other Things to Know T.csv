,"It may surprise some to learn that Tesla isn’t really in the car business. Sure, some 80% of its revenue currently comes from electric vehicles. And CEO Elon Musk is pretty good at squeezing profit out of those cars—something many in the industry still haven’t managed to figure out. But the most important thing to know about the company is that it trades on more than 70 times forward earnings. Ford and General Motors are on five or six times. This suggests that when investors buy Tesla stock, their expectations are in a different universe from when they buy into other car makers. Musk is pulling old-school levers to ensure his cars are profitable, even as rivals churn out lower-cost models. It helps that Tesla can now make more vehicles from the same manufacturing base and squeeze suppliers to cushion margins. At the same time, a closer look at the earnings yesterday—which beat Wall Street estimates—show Tesla’s profits come from plenty of other sources. It made money from software, from selling regulatory credits for making more than its share of zero-emission cars, and from battery storage and charging. Of course, robotaxis and self-driving cars are the next frontier. They’re not really cars—the robotaxi won’t even have a steering wheel or pedals. They are a bet on technology and artificial intelligence, not the automotive industry. It’s why Tesla is one of Nvidia’s best customers. There’s a story about Ray Kroc, the businessman who made McDonald’s the most successful fast-food corporation, and the value of knowing exactly what business you’re really in. For McDonald’s, it’s real estate, not hamburgers. Elon Musk knows he’s not in the car business. He’s selling the future. The tricky part will be delivering on his promises when expectations are already so high. —Brian Swint",I’m in it for the underplayed AI.,0,0.588,POSITIVE,0.995

He has lied to investors over and over and over, and the SEC doesn't care in the least. Even the court system says that he's engaged in ""corporate puffery"".Elon is doing what he's doing because he realizes that corporate power supercedes the government or legal system now.That's why he's openly breaking the law by running a lottery to register voters. He knows it's against the law, but he really doesn't care at all because he knows the law will never come after him. And if it does it will be in a superficial way with a fine that is so tiny that it's probably less than he pays his nanny per year.",0,0.525,NEGATIVE,1.0
