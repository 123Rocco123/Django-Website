If it continues to grow average 10% forever. I might retire with 40 or just work for fun by then. But now my big question. I know money looses value through inflation, about 2,5 % (or 7 if you ask the pessimists) and the average growth on the s&p or msci world is 10% at some point those stocks are so much worth it can’t be comprehended. If I pass the stocks on to my kids and they to their kids. They all are billionaires who get hundreds of millions in growth each year ( even if fiat currencies are much less worth by then). What the actual f? What am I missing , this seems to good to be true?",10% yearly in average over decades is many times over even the worst possible inflation scenario.,0,0.51,NEGATIVE,0.744
