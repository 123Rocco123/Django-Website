,"When both companies went through a stock split early this year (CMG was north of $3,000 and NVDA north of $1,200) I jumped on a few shares as both companies had tremendous growth. CMG stock has increased 250% past couple years, and plans to open between 285 and 315 new restaurants next year, and get into some international markets for the first time, it has experienced revenue growth that even big places like Taco Bell and McDonalds haven’t seen with fewer locations. NVDA has been deemed the most valuable company, AI is the wave of the digital future with NVDA leading the charge, and CMG just makes burritos and bowls but great P/E ratio and same-store sales. Both are two totally different markets and all, but am considering selling my CMG share and dumping them in NVDA. Thoughts?","Chipotle will benefit from the CHIPs act. You saw it here first.Why are Chipotle chips so good?There’s nothing artificial about Chipotle’s intelligence when it comes to chips. It all comes down to two simple ingredients — salt and lime. We all know that the flavors of salt and lime go together like tacos and Tuesdays. Think margaritas, guacamole, and Micheladas, which are all winning combinations that work. The same pairing helps make Chipotle chips taste great.",0,0.514,POSITIVE,0.995
