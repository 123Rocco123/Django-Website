I don't see where the article is so pro-data-collection biased.Do you mean the anecdote about pop-ups at the beginning? I don't see where he's advocating on behalf of data collection.Do you mean the bit about Meta Pay or Consent later on? His point is that Meta's business model and value to advertisers is predicated on personalized advertising (and he cites Eric Seufert's analysis of Meta's revenue to make this point); the EU's insistence that Meta offer a non-personalized advertising alternative means a likely massive hit to their revenue, and the point is that requiring them to do so is effectively an infringement of Meta's property rights. It is not ""pro data collection"" - it is ""businesses generally have a right to define their business model"".",3,0.52,0.999,NEGATIVE
