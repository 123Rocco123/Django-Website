Everything in the stock market will take a hit. It will be a black swan event that will spare no stock. If there are any flight to safety it will be to defense/military stocks.Thinking MSFT will be spare from this is as comically as thinking China will really attack Taiwan.MSFT does not have the same SASS coverage in China as it does on the rest of the world thou. MSFT’s business side of things have basically zero reach inside China. It’s doubtful if they will ever gain any ground inside China for their Sass service.Something to consider,3,0.542,NEGATIVE,1.0

GPUs are better at handling complex math required for the models. Apple started putting an AI focus on their chip, but that’s not the same as what GPU’s can do.You don’t use CPU’s, you use GPUs. And Nvidia has a 10 year lead according to analysts. Nvidia also has the opportunity to branch out and market their other products.Not as diverse as Microsoft though who are in a weird relationship with the top AI modeling company.So pick your pick.

That opens massive doors for competitors, who can sell profitably even 2x worse chips, if they don’t do unreasonable margins.Second, AMD makes GPUs for the past 20 years. Apple makes GPUs for past 10 years and AI chips, which are even more optikized for AI, for the past 8 years. Google makes AI chips (again, which are better for AI than GPUs) for about 8 years. Amazon started making their own AI chips about a year ago. NVIDIA is starting with AI chips just now. Tesla is doing AI chips for about 6 years. Nobody is talking about CPUs.

Just curious as to what the general opinion of these companies futures are. Any input is appreciated This is assuming a long term position 10+ years",My biggest problem with AI is the power demand needs to run severs. You have companies like Amazon buying server farms with dedicated nuclear power plants. Do we have the energy capabilities to run AI to its full potential which markets have priced in for the LT. ST i think AI will continue to go up based on people trying to early adopt the technology but i don’t think the world has the power demand capabilities.

First version of GPT-4 needed 12 times more energy than latest model - and it’s less than 2 years. Many more improvements are coming.Second, training takes most of the energy demand - especially for more intelligent models. And training is done once per model, regardless of usage. So if we use AI 100 times more than today, energy requirements would maybe double or so. So growth in energy usage will be limited.Third - Until now, training was done mostly on GPUs. GPU is designed to do graphical heavy tasks, not AI, though it can do AI reasonably well. But with chips specifically designed for AI, power usage will be much smaller for the same task.TL;DR - energy requirements will grow at very slow pace, even if usage skyrockets.",4,0.537,NEGATIVE,1.0
