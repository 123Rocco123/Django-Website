,"Alphabet will excel in the AI and automation sectors, but the resulting industry shift will be a net loss for the M7 company as AI eats into its search revenue. With the ""Attention is all you need"" paper Alphabet has already etched itself into AI history. Its cloud computing arm is keeping up with AWS and Azure. Waymo threatens to eat Tesla's lunch. Its TPU may very well knock Nvidia off its perch. But even if all that happens, it won't make up for the losses to its search business when AI chatbots take over many of the functions of search. Despite all the efforts into diversification, more than half of Alphabet's revenue still comes from search. So if people turn to Chat-GPT instead of Google as the primary web surfing tool, Alphabet will take a big hit to its most important segment. If GPT can give me the results I want, plus summaries and links and review aggregates, all on voice command, why would I ever need to go on Google and get exposed to its sponsored results? The OAI partnership with Apple may signal the beginning of this shift. Much of Alphabet's valuation comes from its ridiculous dominance in search. All of its other ventures face stiff competition from other M7 companies and OAI, and I have a hard time believing Alphabet will crush them the way it crushed Yahoo. Ultimately, Alphabet stands to lose heavily early in the AI revolution. The company will survive, but without a massive moat in a crucial industry, it may go the way of Netflix and lose its elite status among the likes of META, MSFT, and NVDA.",I might have believed your bearish prediction if I didn’t know Google’s infrastructure and ecosystem.,0,0.512,0.989,NEGATIVE

People forget the sheer scale at which google operates - the search engine alone fields like 500,000 queries per second. Most chatbots require paid subscriptions and rate limit you after like 20 queries a day.. And they're still operating at massive losses simply because it's so damn expensive to train these models and serve them in production. OpenAI, anthropic, perplexity <insert your favorite AI lab here> - they are all a LONG way off before they can operate at googles scale - let alone sustainably with profits. OpenAI is already the most unprofitable startup in silicon valley history, they wouldn't be able to keep the lights on if their product were truly popular and had even a fraction of Google traffic.Not to mention, as Sundar said in the last earnings report, Google is seeing strong query growth in pretty much all markets. So the 500K # is a moving target, could easily double to 1M within the next five years as developing economies (eg Africa) are onboarded onto the Internet and mobile phones (Google is synonymous with the internet at this point, and poorer economies are going to lean heavily on Android just because of cost. Both of these secular trends are another strong tailwind for Google and should contribute to more query growth).",1,0.529,1.0,NEGATIVE

Are they profitable? What data to train on do they actually own vs paying Reddit and others for? Do they have a source for continued training if those deals fall through or become too expensive? How are they going to monetize against all of the compute costs necessary to expand and serve billions of users? Selling some subscriptions (who would pay for search?) and selling access to other companies to build on top of doesn’t sound sustainable to me. Once the products like copilot or Siri or Alexa are built out, there are plenty of competing LLMs out there to swap in. It might be 5 years or more before models are fairly comparable in general then it’s a race for specialization like medical and law.OpenAI is in a funding war to keep the crown of best LLM for these use cases and it’s competing directly with its customers who own the data they need to stay on top. I think Microsoft will end up taking any profit that OpenAI would generate and Microsoft is just OK at search, they might gain some share but google has a moat. Microsoft is more interested in selling copilot and software subscriptions for businesses that include it.
