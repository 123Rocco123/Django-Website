,"I recommend watching Jensen's interview with Patrick Collison at a recent Stripe Conference. Jensen forecasts the need to replace $2 Trillion worth of computers with GPUs. Optimistic forecast but I can see the need to move away from general compute. The concept of building A.I. factories is fascinating. 2. Nvidia has a market cap of $2.6 Trillion. Intel ~$130 Billion, or 5% of Nvidia. If the GPU compute demand is there, Nvidia will need to expand their manufacturing capabilities. Something Intel does well. Even at a 100% premium, an Intel acquisition would not dilute Nvidia shareholders by more than 10%. While I don't think this deal is likely (probably will get blocked), it's an interesting thought experiment. At what point will Nvidia manufacture more in-house vs outsourcing? Let me know what you think. Elliott announced an activist stake in Texas Instruments this morning too. It looks like more semiconductor deal-making will happen either way.","Even if for some bizarre reason they wanted to buy Intel, they wouldn't be allowed to by regulators",0,0.533,0.988,NEGATIVE

Nvidia could never make an offer large enough without being all stock to buy them. It'd have to be mostly stock and some cash, and even then I doubt that they'd have enough.Second, Huang has made it pretty clear that he doesn't have any interest in Intel's market. The culture of the 2 companies is so wildly different, and the way they run things(Nvidia more software, leaner ship, almost all in Cali vs Intel being mostly hardware, heavy fab filled ship, spread around the US) would cause major clashes and lead to terrible integration.Third, regulation. There's just no way that'd work out for Nvidia.Fourth, why would Nvidia even want Intel? I mean, yeah, Intel is a massive company, but they operate in such different ways, and the future of the 2 companies is wildly different(Nvidia with Ai, Intel with fabs) It'd make so much more sense to buy an AMD, Qualcomm, or smaller chip company, or more likely a software company.",0,0.573,1.0,NEGATIVE

Intel Foundries could represent a growth opportunity or just a cost cutting measure. But they could probably get an x86 license out of the deal, if they wanted one. Actually it makes a lot of sense as a target for acquisition if the stock reverts to the mean but still ends up being worth a few hundred million. They would have a built in client in intel subsidizing it and the option to start broad foundry services (or probably not, honestly) or just control their own fabs.

,"I recommend watching Jensen's interview with Patrick Collison at a recent Stripe Conference. Jensen forecasts the need to replace $2 Trillion worth of computers with GPUs. Optimistic forecast but I can see the need to move away from general compute. The concept of building A.I. factories is fascinating. 2. Nvidia has a market cap of $2.6 Trillion. Intel ~$130 Billion, or 5% of Nvidia. If the GPU compute demand is there, Nvidia will need to expand their manufacturing capabilities. Something Intel does well. Even at a 100% premium, an Intel acquisition would not dilute Nvidia shareholders by more than 10%. While I don't think this deal is likely (probably will get blocked), it's an interesting thought experiment. At what point will Nvidia manufacture more in-house vs outsourcing? Let me know what you think. Elliott announced an activist stake in Texas Instruments this morning too. It looks like more semiconductor deal-making will happen either way.",,0,,,
