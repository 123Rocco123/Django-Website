,"The world is going into the AI era, and I just don’t see Apple in it. It seems iPhone is close to its fullest potential, they are throwing the same phone out for many years now, and people are much less hyped about it. While back then, it was worth it to get the new one every year for the upgrades, now new iPhones are just A(n+1) processor, new colors, and a bit better camera. They look the same too, so it has lost its “status symbol” attribute too. I don’t see it changing soon. Pretty much same with iPads. Apple Watch is like.. it’s a watch, they can improve on it, but I don’t see people sitting on needles waiting when the new one will come out. They can improve battery life, make it brighter every year as the sun, make it do something with every sort of sign language hand movements (why though?) but that’s it. Macs aren’t going to save them either, they are faster for sure, but there’s not a huge market for them, or in other words, no massive growth is expected. There’s potential in VR, but in my opinion VR is very very far from being able to be an everyday wearable, and it’s for sure they won’t be the ones developing VR to that point. Why? Well, that’s my main point. Apple has never been an innovator, they were always the last to adapt something, and only when they were able to “perfect it” (even though they have massively failed many times). I’m just afraid they aren’t good positioned for either promising areas: AI, and VR. My theory is they will be afraid of AI, because it’s something that’s much harder to control, and perfect. I don’t see how Apple, being a control freak, would be able to live with something that’s not predictable. For VR, I think they will wait until they will be way late from the game. They will come out with something that’s 5 years behind, but I’m not sure they will be able to get away with it (as they were able to do with iPhones - which I cannot understand how they did till this day). They also don’t have a shovel in the AI gold rush as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia do. I’m genuinely worried about the future of Apple, and seems like they can be the next Nokia. Just to clarify, I’m not anti Apple, I’m the one who buys all the crap they throw out (iPhone, watch, beats, Mac, iPad), that’s why I see they are getting less and less exciting. What do you think?",You should short Apple,0,0.505,0.993,NEGATIVE

What do you think?","In addition people are just mental with regard to this AI hype, becomes almost religious at this point. They completely lost relation in this regard. But most people are stupid, they read something all over the news and just repeat it like a parrot.I do not even doubt the disruptive nature of AI on our society, yes it will change our economy and jobs fundamentally. But as with computers in the 80s or the internet hype in early 20s (dotcom bubble) we are just in the earliest steps, we have no clue how this will all play out. We are in the first months of a decade long process and people are going mad if whatever company has not already implemented some kind of (useless) complete disruptive AI product.Sorry but if you sell coconuts, t shirts or even hardware you don’t need to have a ruled out AI plan.Little bit different for software companies such as Microsoft, of course they should try to be part of the movement.For years to come, people will use the product range of Apple. When AI disrupts Microsoft office you can just load it on your iPhone.I dont even own Apple, but no, a company such as Apple does not need to leader on AI and throw endless money down the drain to join the hype. They can just monitor the process and adapt it to their products. On the other hand 50% of those AI companies valued at Quattrizilion dollars while losing money will note make it (in 5-10 years you will see big consolidation) and go to shit. And once again many people will lose loads of money now hopping on the hype train. Of course those investing in the few future market leaders in AI will earn tons of money as well.",1,0.54,1.0,NEGATIVE

While back then, it was worth it to get the new one every year for the upgrades, now new iPhones are just A(n+1) processor, new colors, and a bit better camera. They look the same too, so it has lost its “status symbol” attribute too. I don’t see it changing soon. Pretty much same with iPads. Apple Watch is like.. it’s a watch, they can improve on it, but I don’t see people sitting on needles waiting when the new one will come out. They can improve battery life, make it brighter every year as the sun, make it do something with every sort of sign language hand movements (why though?) but that’s it. Macs aren’t going to save them either, they are faster for sure, but there’s not a huge market for them, or in other words, no massive growth is expected. There’s potential in VR, but in my opinion VR is very very far from being able to be an everyday wearable, and it’s for sure they won’t be the ones developing VR to that point. Why? Well, that’s my main point. Apple has never been an innovator, they were always the last to adapt something, and only when they were able to “perfect it” (even though they have massively failed many times). I’m just afraid they aren’t good positioned for either promising areas: AI, and VR. My theory is they will be afraid of AI, because it’s something that’s much harder to control, and perfect. I don’t see how Apple, being a control freak, would be able to live with something that’s not predictable. For VR, I think they will wait until they will be way late from the game. They will come out with something that’s 5 years behind, but I’m not sure they will be able to get away with it (as they were able to do with iPhones - which I cannot understand how they did till this day). They also don’t have a shovel in the AI gold rush as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia do. I’m genuinely worried about the future of Apple, and seems like they can be the next Nokia. Just to clarify, I’m not anti Apple, I’m the one who buys all the crap they throw out (iPhone, watch, beats, Mac, iPad), that’s why I see they are getting less and less exciting.

I’m just afraid they aren’t good positioned for either promising areas: AI, and VR. My theory is they will be afraid of AI, because it’s something that’s much harder to control, and perfect.

What do you think?","They make the best mobile computers on the planet. Vision Pro and AR will eventually replace mobile phones. Been using AVP since release and it is absolutely mind blowing what this thing can do. Within the next decade, I think these will be huge.Apple can also leverage AI into their tight ecosystem. They have the processing power to make AI do a lot of heavy lifting right on the device and let all your products and services be tied to it. With over a billion devices installed, they can add to services and raise the price.",0,0.557,0.999,POSITIVE
,"The world is going into the AI era, and I just don’t see Apple in it. It seems iPhone is close to its fullest potential, they are throwing the same phone out for many years now, and people are much less hyped about it. While back then, it was worth it to get the new one every year for the upgrades, now new iPhones are just A(n+1) processor, new colors, and a bit better camera. They look the same too, so it has lost its “status symbol” attribute too. I don’t see it changing soon. Pretty much same with iPads. Apple Watch is like.. it’s a watch, they can improve on it, but I don’t see people sitting on needles waiting when the new one will come out. They can improve battery life, make it brighter every year as the sun, make it do something with every sort of sign language hand movements (why though?) but that’s it. Macs aren’t going to save them either, they are faster for sure, but there’s not a huge market for them, or in other words, no massive growth is expected. There’s potential in VR, but in my opinion VR is very very far from being able to be an everyday wearable, and it’s for sure they won’t be the ones developing VR to that point. Why? Well, that’s my main point. Apple has never been an innovator, they were always the last to adapt something, and only when they were able to “perfect it” (even though they have massively failed many times). I’m just afraid they aren’t good positioned for either promising areas: AI, and VR. My theory is they will be afraid of AI, because it’s something that’s much harder to control, and perfect.

I absolutely do not doubt that their profitability will decline but the problem is lack of innovation and high priced products will just make me wondering how are they going to sustain the moat.Maybe not much to worry for one more decade but I do worry to hold it as a lifetime stock.

($155B in operating income in CY23).AAPL stock action this year reminds me alittle of when in the fall of 2022 investor concern that Meta would lose share to TikTok pressured the stock to $100.

But foldable smartphones are now 6 years old, I do imagine they’ll time release one for interest. All this is to say that even though they are slow to innovate, rather trying to perfect a tech first, they have something like 70 billion dollars in cash reserves and tech talent from Ivy League schools.

The Vision Pro is a joke for the average person and crazy expensive.People forget because most here are too young to know but Apple was a DEAD company before Steve Jobs came back to Apple. I mean it was literally dying. When he passed away I knew they would EVENTUALLY struggle again. Why? Because he was the true visionary behind their products.
