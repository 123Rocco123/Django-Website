,"S&P had a phenomenol run year to date. It has journeyed almost 1000 points from 4743 on 2nd January, 2024 to 5705 on 31st October, 2024. It made two valiant [but failed] lunges to 6000 on 14th October (5860) and then on 18th October (5865). Now the question is whether S&P can make the last mile and reach the summit of 6000 by the end this year? What will take for S&P to continue its ascent: Election results: there is palpable excitement among investors on US election results in November. Punters are betting heavily on a Trump win while polls are showing very narrow lead for Harris. Once the dust of election result is settled then investors will have a better outlook of what to expect in 2025 and beyond. Election results may by itself be sufficient to cause of surge or a crash (buy the rumour & sell the news). Another US Fed rate cut: PCE data on 31st October indicated that the menace of inflation has been tamed and leaves room for 1 or 2 rate cuts for 2024. 1 rate cut is almost certain and priced in, but the market may react if there a deviation from this widely held expecations. Blockbuster earnings from Nvidia: S&P has often rode the coat tails of Nvidia in 2024 and the last earnings from the mega company may not be very different. While the sales revenue and EPS is certain to beat analysts expectations, it is the forward guidance that holds the key now.

The company builds a whole lot more. Then, all those first buyers are done, and sales slow. Now, there's all these phones that are not selling. So, they drop the price to 300. Pretty soon, they're selling again to new buyers - and sell out. Now, the phone factory has to make more, and more people want it because it's cheaper.Phones cost 100 to make. Sell 100 phones at 500, or sell 1000 phones at 300. It's not a question of what the seller thinks they are worth, it's what the market says they are worth - the market being the buyers.Then, the news says the phones suck, and sales slow. But an online review says they actually are awesome, and now they're on sale for 279. And so, sales go back up again.Then they make a version 2.0 of the phone, that has one little improvement. Guess what? Start the whole sequence all over again.It's cost-x-demand. Price goes up, then falls, and goes back up.A ""correction"" is simply that - it can't just keep going up forever, it has to take a break and reality has to check it. Nothing ever just goes up perpetually, endlessly, without a break.The economy is not a phone, but goes through phases similar to this.Imagine a bus with no brakes, it moves forward, SLAMS into reverse to pick up a few passengers, and then grinds into forward again. And on a bad day, month or year, it gets stuck in reverse for a bit.",3,0.55,NEGATIVE,1.0,0.55,1.0
