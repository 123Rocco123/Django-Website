,"I invested around $14k into Core Scientific late last fall when it was still in bankruptcy. They have since emerged from bankruptcy and are back trading on NASDAQ. As part of their BK exit, I was granted various warrants which are tradeable under separate tickers CORZZ and CORZW. I currently have around $190k to $200k in gains (including warrants) and CORZ current market cap is $4.8B. Conversion to HPC Datacenter Hosting: During this past summer, the CEO Adam Sullivan , made a strategic decision to change the Company's business model from a pure bitcoin miner to HPC hosting. The Company during a short period of time signed CoreWeave to 3 large contracts locking up 500MW of existing critical IT load. These CoreWeave contracts will generate $8.7B of revenue over 12 years at 75% margins. CoreWeave pays for all of the capex, power and utilities, and is backed by Nvidia, Cisco and Blackstone. This revenue will scale up starting in Q1 2025 with the project fully being onboarded by Q4 2026 generating annual revenue of $725M a year for the next 12 years. CORZ believes they can unlock an additional 300MW of Critical IT load at existing sites, and they have found another 400MW of Critical IT load at new sites. This will allow CORZ to secure 1.2GW of Critical IT load by 2027, according to Adam. CORZ also just announced raising a $550M 0% convertible note, which may be used for capex and to acquire additional HPC sites. Notes are convertible at $22.49, well above the current SP. Bitcoin Mining: While no longer the primary focus of the Company, they still have 20.4 EH/s of self mining hash rate, making them one of the top 5 miners in the U.S. with monthly self mined bitcoin approximating 330 to 350 bitcoins. They also signed an agreement with Block, Inc in 2024 to acquire 15 EH/s of their new 3nm ASIC chip for bitcoin mining, which may have a material impact on their mining operations by increasing EH and updating their existing fleet. I would expect an increase in CORZ EH over the next 6 months while also lowering their cost to mine as these new chips and miners are deployed and upgraded. Argument for Continued Hodling: With all of that being said, the CEO has made several statements regarding the Company's valuation and said he believes CORZ valuation should approximate $20B to $25B once the market starts viewing them as an HPC datacenter compared to just a bitcoin miner (current market cap is $4.8B) A market cap of $20B would equate to a share price of $55 to $65 compared to the current share price of $16 to $18. While not an identical businesses, $EQIX has 725MW of datacenters and a market cap of $95B, and given the differences and similarities in the two businesses, a market cap of $20B does seem attainable for CORZ. If CORZ hits a market cap north of $20B, it should push my gains up to $700k plus. Argument for Selling: CORZ in my opinion is still more closely aligned with Bitcoin mining vs. HPC hosting. It goes up and down with bitcoin. The conversion to HPC is in its early stages, is highly complex, and is the 75% plus profit margin that Adam touted truly attainable? I don't necessarily understand how the CoreWeave's $725M annual run rate of revenue, even with $540M of margin, drives the valuation up to $20B. I would think they need to double that margin and have 1GW committed under contract and how many years will that take? They will be tied up through 2026 onboarding CoreWeave, do they really have the capacity to onboard a number of other new customers and how does the supply chain look for HPCs to meet that demand. In the meantime, if bitcoin starts a downward trend, so would my current gains. Final Thought: Should I take a win and move on, or let it all keep riding. Has anyone else been following Core Scientific and what are your opinions on the current and future valuations / achievable HPC plan? I'm inclined to go for glory or bust, but those in my inner circle (wife's boyfriend) keep telling me to sell. Below are snips showing my gains. I hold CORZ and warrants (CORZZ and CORZW) in two different broker accounts and they have 3 tickers, 1 for the stock and 2 for the different warrants they granted to shareholders at bankruptcy exit, so annoying to pull together but see below snapshot.","TLDRTicker: CORZ (and warrants CORZZ, CORZW)Direction: Potentially Up (high risk/high reward)Prognosis: HODL or Sell?

This revenue will scale up starting in Q1 2025 with the project fully being onboarded by Q4 2026 generating annual revenue of $725M a year for the next 12 years. CORZ believes they can unlock an additional 300MW of Critical IT load at existing sites, and they have found another 400MW of Critical IT load at new sites. This will allow CORZ to secure 1.2GW of Critical IT load by 2027, according to Adam. CORZ also just announced raising a $550M 0% convertible note, which may be used for capex and to acquire additional HPC sites. Notes are convertible at $22.49, well above the current SP. Bitcoin Mining: While no longer the primary focus of the Company, they still have 20.4 EH/s of self mining hash rate, making them one of the top 5 miners in the U.S. with monthly self mined bitcoin approximating 330 to 350 bitcoins. They also signed an agreement with Block, Inc in 2024 to acquire 15 EH/s of their new 3nm ASIC chip for bitcoin mining, which may have a material impact on their mining operations by increasing EH and updating their existing fleet. I would expect an increase in CORZ EH over the next 6 months while also lowering their cost to mine as these new chips and miners are deployed and upgraded. Argument for Continued Hodling: With all of that being said, the CEO has made several statements regarding the Company's valuation and said he believes CORZ valuation should approximate $20B to $25B once the market starts viewing them as an HPC datacenter compared to just a bitcoin miner (current market cap is $4.8B) A market cap of $20B would equate to a share price of $55 to $65 compared to the current share price of $16 to $18. While not an identical businesses, $EQIX has 725MW of datacenters and a market cap of $95B, and given the differences and similarities in the two businesses, a market cap of $20B does seem attainable for CORZ. If CORZ hits a market cap north of $20B, it should push my gains up to $700k plus. Argument for Selling: CORZ in my opinion is still more closely aligned with Bitcoin mining vs. HPC hosting. It goes up and down with bitcoin. The conversion to HPC is in its early stages, is highly complex, and is the 75% plus profit margin that Adam touted truly attainable? I don't necessarily understand how the CoreWeave's $725M annual run rate of revenue, even with $540M of margin, drives the valuation up to $20B. I would think they need to double that margin and have 1GW committed under contract and how many years will that take? They will be tied up through 2026 onboarding CoreWeave, do they really have the capacity to onboard a number of other new customers and how does the supply chain look for HPCs to meet that demand. In the meantime, if bitcoin starts a downward trend, so would my current gains. Final Thought: Should I take a win and move on, or let it all keep riding. Has anyone else been following Core Scientific and what are your opinions on the current and future valuations / achievable HPC plan? I'm inclined to go for glory or bust, but those in my inner circle (wife's boyfriend) keep telling me to sell. Below are snips showing my gains.

CORZ believes they can unlock an additional 300MW of Critical IT load at existing sites, and they have found another 400MW of Critical IT load at new sites. This will allow CORZ to secure 1.2GW of Critical IT load by 2027, according to Adam. CORZ also just announced raising a $550M 0% convertible note, which may be used for capex and to acquire additional HPC sites. Notes are convertible at $22.49, well above the current SP. Bitcoin Mining: While no longer the primary focus of the Company, they still have 20.4 EH/s of self mining hash rate, making them one of the top 5 miners in the U.S. with monthly self mined bitcoin approximating 330 to 350 bitcoins. They also signed an agreement with Block, Inc in 2024 to acquire 15 EH/s of their new 3nm ASIC chip for bitcoin mining, which may have a material impact on their mining operations by increasing EH and updating their existing fleet. I would expect an increase in CORZ EH over the next 6 months while also lowering their cost to mine as these new chips and miners are deployed and upgraded. Argument for Continued Hodling: With all of that being said, the CEO has made several statements regarding the Company's valuation and said he believes CORZ valuation should approximate $20B to $25B once the market starts viewing them as an HPC datacenter compared to just a bitcoin miner (current market cap is $4.8B) A market cap of $20B would equate to a share price of $55 to $65 compared to the current share price of $16 to $18. While not an identical businesses, $EQIX has 725MW of datacenters and a market cap of $95B, and given the differences and similarities in the two businesses, a market cap of $20B does seem attainable for CORZ. If CORZ hits a market cap north of $20B, it should push my gains up to $700k plus. Argument for Selling: CORZ in my opinion is still more closely aligned with Bitcoin mining vs. HPC hosting. It goes up and down with bitcoin. The conversion to HPC is in its early stages, is highly complex, and is the 75% plus profit margin that Adam touted truly attainable? I don't necessarily understand how the CoreWeave's $725M annual run rate of revenue, even with $540M of margin, drives the valuation up to $20B. I would think they need to double that margin and have 1GW committed under contract and how many years will that take? They will be tied up through 2026 onboarding CoreWeave, do they really have the capacity to onboard a number of other new customers and how does the supply chain look for HPCs to meet that demand. In the meantime, if bitcoin starts a downward trend, so would my current gains. Final Thought: Should I take a win and move on, or let it all keep riding. Has anyone else been following Core Scientific and what are your opinions on the current and future valuations / achievable HPC plan? I'm inclined to go for glory or bust, but those in my inner circle (wife's boyfriend) keep telling me to sell. Below are snips showing my gains.

CORZ believes they can unlock an additional 300MW of Critical IT load at existing sites, and they have found another 400MW of Critical IT load at new sites. This will allow CORZ to secure 1.2GW of Critical IT load by 2027, according to Adam. CORZ also just announced raising a $550M 0% convertible note, which may be used for capex and to acquire additional HPC sites. Notes are convertible at $22.49, well above the current SP. Bitcoin Mining: While no longer the primary focus of the Company, they still have 20.4 EH/s of self mining hash rate, making them one of the top 5 miners in the U.S. with monthly self mined bitcoin approximating 330 to 350 bitcoins. They also signed an agreement with Block, Inc in 2024 to acquire 15 EH/s of their new 3nm ASIC chip for bitcoin mining, which may have a material impact on their mining operations by increasing EH and updating their existing fleet. I would expect an increase in CORZ EH over the next 6 months while also lowering their cost to mine as these new chips and miners are deployed and upgraded. Argument for Continued Hodling: With all of that being said, the CEO has made several statements regarding the Company's valuation and said he believes CORZ valuation should approximate $20B to $25B once the market starts viewing them as an HPC datacenter compared to just a bitcoin miner (current market cap is $4.8B) A market cap of $20B would equate to a share price of $55 to $65 compared to the current share price of $16 to $18. While not an identical businesses, $EQIX has 725MW of datacenters and a market cap of $95B, and given the differences and similarities in the two businesses, a market cap of $20B does seem attainable for CORZ. If CORZ hits a market cap north of $20B, it should push my gains up to $700k plus. Argument for Selling: CORZ in my opinion is still more closely aligned with Bitcoin mining vs. HPC hosting. It goes up and down with bitcoin. The conversion to HPC is in its early stages, is highly complex, and is the 75% plus profit margin that Adam touted truly attainable? I don't necessarily understand how the CoreWeave's $725M annual run rate of revenue, even with $540M of margin, drives the valuation up to $20B. I would think they need to double that margin and have 1GW committed under contract and how many years will that take? They will be tied up through 2026 onboarding CoreWeave, do they really have the capacity to onboard a number of other new customers and how does the supply chain look for HPCs to meet that demand. In the meantime, if bitcoin starts a downward trend, so would my current gains. Final Thought: Should I take a win and move on, or let it all keep riding. Has anyone else been following Core Scientific and what are your opinions on the current and future valuations / achievable HPC plan?

I have held CORZ since December of 22, when it was 0.10 a share. Now I didn't sell, so I've been holding long enough for long-term capital gains, but what is the deal with what happened in January?Did the issuing of new shares, warrants and my escrow shares change this to now a short-term capital gain or am I still under the date that I made my purchase back in '22?Also, since it was a swap, we don't pay extra because we received the warrants and escrow shares right?",0,0.541,NEGATIVE,0.999

This revenue will scale up starting in Q1 2025 with the project fully being onboarded by Q4 2026 generating annual revenue of $725M a year for the next 12 years. CORZ believes they can unlock an additional 300MW of Critical IT load at existing sites, and they have found another 400MW of Critical IT load at new sites. This will allow CORZ to secure 1.2GW of Critical IT load by 2027, according to Adam. CORZ also just announced raising a $550M 0% convertible note, which may be used for capex and to acquire additional HPC sites. Notes are convertible at $22.49, well above the current SP. Bitcoin Mining: While no longer the primary focus of the Company, they still have 20.4 EH/s of self mining hash rate, making them one of the top 5 miners in the U.S. with monthly self mined bitcoin approximating 330 to 350 bitcoins. They also signed an agreement with Block, Inc in 2024 to acquire 15 EH/s of their new 3nm ASIC chip for bitcoin mining, which may have a material impact on their mining operations by increasing EH and updating their existing fleet. I would expect an increase in CORZ EH over the next 6 months while also lowering their cost to mine as these new chips and miners are deployed and upgraded. Argument for Continued Hodling: With all of that being said, the CEO has made several statements regarding the Company's valuation and said he believes CORZ valuation should approximate $20B to $25B once the market starts viewing them as an HPC datacenter compared to just a bitcoin miner (current market cap is $4.8B) A market cap of $20B would equate to a share price of $55 to $65 compared to the current share price of $16 to $18. While not an identical businesses, $EQIX has 725MW of datacenters and a market cap of $95B, and given the differences and similarities in the two businesses, a market cap of $20B does seem attainable for CORZ. If CORZ hits a market cap north of $20B, it should push my gains up to $700k plus. Argument for Selling: CORZ in my opinion is still more closely aligned with Bitcoin mining vs. HPC hosting. It goes up and down with bitcoin. The conversion to HPC is in its early stages, is highly complex, and is the 75% plus profit margin that Adam touted truly attainable? I don't necessarily understand how the CoreWeave's $725M annual run rate of revenue, even with $540M of margin, drives the valuation up to $20B. I would think they need to double that margin and have 1GW committed under contract and how many years will that take? They will be tied up through 2026 onboarding CoreWeave, do they really have the capacity to onboard a number of other new customers and how does the supply chain look for HPCs to meet that demand. In the meantime, if bitcoin starts a downward trend, so would my current gains. Final Thought: Should I take a win and move on, or let it all keep riding. Has anyone else been following Core Scientific and what are your opinions on the current and future valuations / achievable HPC plan? I'm inclined to go for glory or bust, but those in my inner circle (wife's boyfriend) keep telling me to sell. Below are snips showing my gains.

CORZ also just announced raising a $550M 0% convertible note, which may be used for capex and to acquire additional HPC sites. Notes are convertible at $22.49, well above the current SP. Bitcoin Mining: While no longer the primary focus of the Company, they still have 20.4 EH/s of self mining hash rate, making them one of the top 5 miners in the U.S. with monthly self mined bitcoin approximating 330 to 350 bitcoins. They also signed an agreement with Block, Inc in 2024 to acquire 15 EH/s of their new 3nm ASIC chip for bitcoin mining, which may have a material impact on their mining operations by increasing EH and updating their existing fleet. I would expect an increase in CORZ EH over the next 6 months while also lowering their cost to mine as these new chips and miners are deployed and upgraded. Argument for Continued Hodling: With all of that being said, the CEO has made several statements regarding the Company's valuation and said he believes CORZ valuation should approximate $20B to $25B once the market starts viewing them as an HPC datacenter compared to just a bitcoin miner (current market cap is $4.8B) A market cap of $20B would equate to a share price of $55 to $65 compared to the current share price of $16 to $18. While not an identical businesses, $EQIX has 725MW of datacenters and a market cap of $95B, and given the differences and similarities in the two businesses, a market cap of $20B does seem attainable for CORZ. If CORZ hits a market cap north of $20B, it should push my gains up to $700k plus. Argument for Selling: CORZ in my opinion is still more closely aligned with Bitcoin mining vs. HPC hosting. It goes up and down with bitcoin. The conversion to HPC is in its early stages, is highly complex, and is the 75% plus profit margin that Adam touted truly attainable? I don't necessarily understand how the CoreWeave's $725M annual run rate of revenue, even with $540M of margin, drives the valuation up to $20B. I would think they need to double that margin and have 1GW committed under contract and how many years will that take? They will be tied up through 2026 onboarding CoreWeave, do they really have the capacity to onboard a number of other new customers and how does the supply chain look for HPCs to meet that demand. In the meantime, if bitcoin starts a downward trend, so would my current gains. Final Thought: Should I take a win and move on, or let it all keep riding. Has anyone else been following Core Scientific and what are your opinions on the current and future valuations / achievable HPC plan?

This will allow CORZ to secure 1.2GW of Critical IT load by 2027, according to Adam. CORZ also just announced raising a $550M 0% convertible note, which may be used for capex and to acquire additional HPC sites. Notes are convertible at $22.49, well above the current SP. Bitcoin Mining: While no longer the primary focus of the Company, they still have 20.4 EH/s of self mining hash rate, making them one of the top 5 miners in the U.S. with monthly self mined bitcoin approximating 330 to 350 bitcoins. They also signed an agreement with Block, Inc in 2024 to acquire 15 EH/s of their new 3nm ASIC chip for bitcoin mining, which may have a material impact on their mining operations by increasing EH and updating their existing fleet. I would expect an increase in CORZ EH over the next 6 months while also lowering their cost to mine as these new chips and miners are deployed and upgraded. Argument for Continued Hodling: With all of that being said, the CEO has made several statements regarding the Company's valuation and said he believes CORZ valuation should approximate $20B to $25B once the market starts viewing them as an HPC datacenter compared to just a bitcoin miner (current market cap is $4.8B) A market cap of $20B would equate to a share price of $55 to $65 compared to the current share price of $16 to $18. While not an identical businesses, $EQIX has 725MW of datacenters and a market cap of $95B, and given the differences and similarities in the two businesses, a market cap of $20B does seem attainable for CORZ. If CORZ hits a market cap north of $20B, it should push my gains up to $700k plus. Argument for Selling: CORZ in my opinion is still more closely aligned with Bitcoin mining vs. HPC hosting. It goes up and down with bitcoin. The conversion to HPC is in its early stages, is highly complex, and is the 75% plus profit margin that Adam touted truly attainable? I don't necessarily understand how the CoreWeave's $725M annual run rate of revenue, even with $540M of margin, drives the valuation up to $20B. I would think they need to double that margin and have 1GW committed under contract and how many years will that take? They will be tied up through 2026 onboarding CoreWeave, do they really have the capacity to onboard a number of other new customers and how does the supply chain look for HPCs to meet that demand. In the meantime, if bitcoin starts a downward trend, so would my current gains. Final Thought: Should I take a win and move on, or let it all keep riding. Has anyone else been following Core Scientific and what are your opinions on the current and future valuations / achievable HPC plan? I'm inclined to go for glory or bust, but those in my inner circle (wife's boyfriend) keep telling me to sell. Below are snips showing my gains.

Conversion to HPC Datacenter Hosting: During this past summer, the CEO Adam Sullivan , made a strategic decision to change the Company's business model from a pure bitcoin miner to HPC hosting. The Company during a short period of time signed CoreWeave to 3 large contracts locking up 500MW of existing critical IT load. These CoreWeave contracts will generate $8.7B of revenue over 12 years at 75% margins. CoreWeave pays for all of the capex, power and utilities, and is backed by Nvidia, Cisco and Blackstone. This revenue will scale up starting in Q1 2025 with the project fully being onboarded by Q4 2026 generating annual revenue of $725M a year for the next 12 years.
