,nan,That's not sideways,2,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.986
,nan,I guess that's true but a 15% range is pretty well confined for this ticker. I don't expect buying to overtake the selling at 150 any time very soon. Obviously 135-140 will be a fight too. It won't be sideways the whole time but it'll mean revert and retest the whole way so it'll feel sideways at times.,3,0.518,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,"I think the more accurate term is range bound. A good example would be META trading between 430-520 from 02/24 to 08/24 before breaking out a months long period of consolidation.Ill also add when I wrote my initial comment, it wasn‚Äôt inherently bearish or bullish, I just personally think NVDA has no real reason to go up or down significantly in the interim until the next major catalyst, which is likely the next earnings report; of course anything can happen.",3,0.538,NEGATIVE,0.998

,nan,Good time for entry,0,0.557,POSITIVE,0.995
,nan,When in doubt zoom out.This price action is happening along the bottom of a rising wedge/channel beginning Aug 5 '24 with a low at 90.69. (lol). That trendline was tagged again a month later on 9/6 and then again (wait for it) yesterday.I think we see a try back to break 150 now that 130 seems to be a support level after serving as resistance since before late August. If 140 can become support after that it's up another level. 150 seems to be the line in the sand for now.,0,0.518,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,"I appreciate the take here. The fundamentals also seem to be solid unless i‚Äôm missing something. Doubled revenue. Doubled gross profit. Low debt comparatively. And they have 90% of the GPU market. you have the data centers that will continue to grow because AI is just in the early stages of implementation, couple that with blackwell coming and a lot of large corps. are allocating toward blackwell which will be a tailwind. The PE multiple being high is somewhat justifiable due to the growth but nonetheless slightly high, i don‚Äôt know about 10% dip in one month high. The competitors are getting better with cheaper chips but i think their moat is extremely strong.",1,0.534,NEGATIVE,0.999
,nan,"I think it's a combo of uncertainty re: reliance of imports in a heightened tariff environment and how that trims or buffers the bottom line in combination with traders just following TA and exploring price. Something this big has astronomical momentum. Clarification will cause volatility evaporation and we'll see runs again likely very soon in this range, I'll be anticipating anyway.",2,0.51,POSITIVE,0.999
,nan,People tend to forget this stock dropped back to 90 just a few months ago. Staying at 130 this time is already real good,1,0.557,POSITIVE,0.982
,nan,Exactly if this level holds Monday it'll be a pretty decent confirmation of support here and sellers will have to start looking higher. Very interesting moment.,2,0.513,POSITIVE,0.963
,nan,"I generally agree with your take. I've advocated for this resistance-turned-support zone since 2 weeks ago when it tagged the 132ish support zone for the 3rd time. This week will make the 5th time. The price is still holding within the trendline and the support level is battle-tested.The one TA item that concerns me is that a H&S pattern may have formed starting in October - quite visible on the daily chart. I also wonder why it's been hitting the support zone so many times, as if testing to see when it will breakI'm a bit torn due to this and am wondering which will be the stronger indicator through EOY... Will look to see how it opens on Monday, obv my calls and shares are hoping it's up",1,0.525,NEGATIVE,0.718
,nan,"Yes a very clear H/S that's true. It's the sore thumb here I agree. Basically I'm calling for this to become another head for a half formed inverted H/S, but if the 130 level gives then I think that'll disprove my theory in short order and it's look out below.",2,0.529,NEGATIVE,0.903

,nan,"Looks like a trading range with ~132 as strong support which was previous resistance. The lower highs are bearish though and it's turning into a downward wedge, so support could potentially break lower. 132 is still a buying opportunity since most breakouts of trading ranges fail.This is just short term analysis though based on price movement. There has been no bad news for NVDA and it continues to beat earnings, so I'm just holding. I already bought 200 more shares last time it dipped to 132, so there's not much for me to do except HODL.Even if support does break lower, there will be buyers taking advantage of the discount in the 120s.",0,0.525,NEGATIVE,0.998
