LLMs were a brilliant breakthrough in the field for sure, but people are expecting them to do way more than they can actually do at the moment.Sure, Copilot can do pretty nice things, but besides generating very nice boilerplate or small snippets, can it be used to create, maintain, and update a large scale system? Would you expect it to interpret and properly understand requirements and implement exactly what the customers want? At this current point, definitely no. At its current state it is just glorified auto completion, which is nice to have, but nothing much.To change this, there must be another breakthrough discovery in the field.

It definitely has sped up some tasks and my team has seen marginal improvements. Do you have any data to back this up? It feels very finger to the wind or perhaps your tasks require a bit less business context than what we are utilizing it for (flutter and native mobile development).Just for more context there are very large savings when I need a python script of function to do x with well defined and simple inputs and outputs then chatgpt or something else can save effectively close to 100% of dev time. However with a mature product where the ins and outs of a function nerd context or business understanding code generation can be a net time suck.

The big run-up was, at least largely, in the absence of useful, profitable applications for AI. So now the bet is whether those will come or not. I admit I was skeptical about a year ago. Now I think yes, they will. This is kind of a silly example, but I went through a drive-through the other week and AI took my order. This is such a good idea, in my opinion. The employees can just work on making orders and not have to mess around with taking them. And the experience was decent. It got everything right and was at least as pleasant as ordering from a human. That was never anywhere near my radar as a possible use for AI.
