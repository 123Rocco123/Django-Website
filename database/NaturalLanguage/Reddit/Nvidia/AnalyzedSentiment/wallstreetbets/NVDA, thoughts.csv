,Let’s pay zero attention to the “trump media”trade 😆😆😆 (my best and worst trade side by side),"You have to realize any loss in Nvidia will ALWAYS be regained and surpassed over enough time.

,Let’s pay zero attention to the “trump media”trade 😆😆😆 (my best and worst trade side by side),"Moores law has a direct correlation to Nvidias share price which, along with other factors, nearly guarantees this trajectory. Same with the concept of the “singularity”. Share price could exceed $500 in 10 years. I’d go as far to say that it will… eventually",6,0.526,POSITIVE,0.932
,Let’s pay zero attention to the “trump media”trade 😆😆😆 (my best and worst trade side by side),"AI, like the rest of the market, is in a bubble. NVDA is already way overvalued at 3.5 trillion. There's no money to be made in AI. Who needs a thousand chatgpts? It's the same as blockchain, 3D printers, and crypto. It's all hype and of no real use.Even with Nvidia's earnings, its fair value is in the 40s. The stock is only up 7 dollars in 4 months. That's nothing to brag about. With the Nasdaq double topping, rates being cut, yield curve univerting, and a thousand other recession indicators, I'd be careful about bragging.The Fed cut interest rates by 50 in September of 07. There were 6 weeks of gains before the bear market and recession. 6 weeks is coming up and it's coming whether you like it or not.Now you can pray that it goes to 500. That would make it the size of China's whole economy.What's the bad part about cashing in? The NASDAQ went up 40 percent this year and the options prices are pointing downward. Is it worth the loss?Thursday it's going back towards 135",6,0.544,NEGATIVE,1.0

,Let’s pay zero attention to the “trump media”trade 😆😆😆 (my best and worst trade side by side),Selling weekly call options that have a strike price for say $125 this week. So if options get excersised someone will pay you 125$ for each share you own.This is done far away from current price where would be happy to sell at.For example for Friday the $125 strike option would bring in $15 per 100 shares. So with 5000 shares could sell 50 option contracts to get $15 * 50 = $750 paid to you. Seems small but if do this for say 20 weeks it adds up real quick.Main downside is price moves above $125 would still be forced to sell at $125 unless buy the option back.Not financial advice.,2,0.53,NEGATIVE,0.972

,Let’s pay zero attention to the “trump media”trade 😆😆😆 (my best and worst trade side by side),"I would have to purchase them back, to make a one time small profit until all shares are gone and sold for under $125?
