,"Certainly! Here’s a lighthearted skit playing off the classic “Asian parents” stereotype, imagining AMD CEO Lisa Su getting some “feedback” from her parents about her cousin Jensen Huang, CEO of NVIDIA. [Scene: Lisa Su visiting her parents for dinner. They’re seated at the dining table, her mom serving food, her dad reading a newspaper.] Mom: [sighs loudly] Lisa, why so quiet? You seem stressed. Not like your cousin Jensen—he always looks so happy. Maybe it’s because he’s running NVIDIA. Lisa: Mom, I’m the CEO of AMD. We’re doing really well! Have you seen our new Ryzen processors? Dad: Ryzen, Ryzen… didn’t Jensen make something called… the Titan? Or what is it, the 4090? That sounds strong. Titan! Like a god. Lisa: [rolls her eyes] Dad, AMD is doing great! We’re taking on Intel in the CPU market, and our GPUs are competitive, too. Mom: [cutting her off] Yes, yes, very nice, Lisa. But Jensen… he is always in the news! All the kids want NVIDIA graphics cards. I asked your auntie, she said his sales are “through the roof!” Dad: [nodding] And didn’t he just announce some AI thing? All the big tech companies want NVIDIA chips! AI, Lisa! When are you going to do AI? Lisa: [frustrated] We are doing AI! AMD has products in AI, too! And, anyway, not everything is about AI. Mom: Oh, honey, don’t be so defensive. We’re just saying, maybe try a little harder, you know? Think… bigger. You’re smart—almost as smart as Jensen. Dad: Exactly! We’re not asking for much. Just maybe… make AMD a little more… “NVIDIA.” Lisa: [sighs, mumbling to herself] Maybe I should’ve gone into law like a normal person… Mom: [patting her hand] Oh, Lisa, we’re just proud of you. Not as proud as Jensen’s parents, but very proud. [They all eat in awkward silence as Lisa tries not to roll her eyes.] [End Scene]",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999,0.5,0.999
