Therefore, the process can now proceed without re-taping out, as production delays being minimized. The report noted that NVIDIA’s updated version of B200 is expected to be completed by late October, allowing the GB200 to enter mass production in December, with large-scale deliveries to ODMs expected in the first quarter of next year. Previously, as per a report from The Information, NVIDIA’s GB200 was said to be experiencing a one-quarter delay in mass shipments. Another report from the Economic Daily News further suggested that the problem likely lies in the yield rates of advanced packaging, which mainly affected the non-reference-designed GB200 chips. Industry sources cited by Commercial Times addressed that NVIDIA’s Blackwell chip used to be facing instability in metal layers during the HV process, which was then resolved by July. In addition, since the issue reportedly occurred in the back-end-of-line process, a new tape-out was deemed unnecessary. Still, as CoWoS-L capacity remains a bottleneck, the advanced packaging for GB200 this year is expected to adopt CoWoS-S. ~~ Wait until Jerome turns on the money printer over the next quarter btw and that $2T sitting on the sidelines enters into the stonk market.

Therefore, the process can now proceed without re-taping out, as production delays being minimized. The report noted that NVIDIA’s updated version of B200 is expected to be completed by late October, allowing the GB200 to enter mass production in December, with large-scale deliveries to ODMs expected in the first quarter of next year. Previously, as per a report from The Information, NVIDIA’s GB200 was said to be experiencing a one-quarter delay in mass shipments. Another report from the Economic Daily News further suggested that the problem likely lies in the yield rates of advanced packaging, which mainly affected the non-reference-designed GB200 chips.

No one compares valuation multiples of individual companies in different sectors. Coke is a stable business with a stable dividend. It's basically looked at as a safe haven to track inflation plus dividend. There's a reason its a top Buffet holding.Nvidia on the other hand has a majority of their data center business going to 5-6 big tech companies who also happen to be spending a massive amount of money on developing their own AI accelerators to eliminate their reliance on Nvidia. Google TPU is already used for training and serving all their own models (from YouTube to Search to Gemini to Waymo) and big companies like Apple have been using them too. You have Microsoft with their Maia chip development. Amazon has their Trainium and Inferentia chips. Meta has their MTIA chip for inference. Tesla has Dojo. Apple has their own custom silicon for on device inference and it looks like they are also tackling data center chips now too. Then you also have AMD with their big plans for the next few years. And Groq is blowing Nvidia out of the water on inference speeds.And Nvidia doesn't actually make anything they only design chips so every other big tech company can go to TSMC AVGO etc with their designs to get their chips manufactured in the same place as Nvidia. Lots of risk to Nvidia's growth and more importantly their profit margins in the mid term as all the big tech companies develop their own sources of custom AI accelerators.They should be fine in the near term (1-2 years) but people will start looking out further into the future and there are some serious headwinds when you start to consider every big tech company pouring money into solutions to cut Nvidia out.In summary, when your biggest customers happen to also be the biggest tech companies in the world with the deepest pockets in the world there is a lot of risk that they look to cut you out.",4,,0.552,NEGATIVE,0.986

All of the important deep learning libraries that are critical for AI model training and serving already run on the other hardware using CUDA alternatives. PyTorch, Tensorflow, etc. They already run on Google TPUs (they created Tensorflow and Jax), Apple metal, AMD ROCm, Meta MTIA (they created PyTorch), etc.How do you think Google trains Gemini and Waymo models on TPU? How do you think Apple serves machine learning models on their hardware? They aren’t using CUDA. CUDA is just an API for optimizing work loads on nvidia hardware it’s not an insurmountable mountain.

Therefore, the process can now proceed without re-taping out, as production delays being minimized. The report noted that NVIDIA’s updated version of B200 is expected to be completed by late October, allowing the GB200 to enter mass production in December, with large-scale deliveries to ODMs expected in the first quarter of next year. Previously, as per a report from The Information, NVIDIA’s GB200 was said to be experiencing a one-quarter delay in mass shipments. Another report from the Economic Daily News further suggested that the problem likely lies in the yield rates of advanced packaging, which mainly affected the non-reference-designed GB200 chips. Industry sources cited by Commercial Times addressed that NVIDIA’s Blackwell chip used to be facing instability in metal layers during the HV process, which was then resolved by July. In addition, since the issue reportedly occurred in the back-end-of-line process, a new tape-out was deemed unnecessary.
