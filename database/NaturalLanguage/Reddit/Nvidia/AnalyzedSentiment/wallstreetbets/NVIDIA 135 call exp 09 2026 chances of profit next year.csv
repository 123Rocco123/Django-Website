If you’re bullish on Nvidia long term and have that much cash to throw at it I would get like sub 80 and get them on Jan 2027 expiry since it seems to have much more volume. Nvidia would only need to move up 8% to break even on a 60C on that expiry which is a lot more reasonable.,0,0.532,NEGATIVE,1.0

I'm assuming you would have bought around $135Instead, your options will be worth $28,000+ $18,600 at expiration, or $46,600. So roughly the same amountAnything less than around that mark, you would profit more by holding shares if you had bought them instead of holding your options. AND, you:would not have to worry about your shares going to 0still profit between $135-$175, unlike your optionsyou could sell CC's against them if you wanted toUnless you think NVDA is going to be $6T+ by that time, why would you buy options?
