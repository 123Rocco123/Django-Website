,"Had a pitch on PLTR from last Friday. Now that there’s this much insider selling that’s the nail in the coffin. Here’s the pitch for those interested: Recommendation: I recommend a short on Palantir Technologies. The stock is currently priced at $44.79 per share, which I believe will drop by about 20-30% in the next 6–12 months. This is because, the market is highly exuberant in regards to PLTR, pricing in extreme growth rates despite signs of stunting commercial growth. Additionally, overreliance on cyclical government contracts as well as downward pressure on margins due to new AI product launches has led me to believe PLTR is overvalued, which I will prove via this pitch. Company Background: Palantir at its core is a company that focuses on data-analytics, specializing in integrating large amounts of data and operationalizing that data for the public and private sectors. Its speciality lies in the extreme flexibility it provides customers in the form of Forward Deployed Engineers (FDE’s), who can create bespoke AI solutions for any customer. The key platforms are: Gotham, a government intelligence and geospatial platform that is meant to analyze data from various sources to help support military operations and disaster response. Foundry, the commercial segment of the business: This begins with the cleaning and structuring of data, which leads into the integration of this data into AI models (AIP). These models are meant to operationalize company data improving top level decision making. Apollo integrates these systems delivering infrastructure and continual updates. The advantage of this system is two-fold: First is the “ontology”, an effective digital twin of the business, which allows 1. collaboration across departments and 2. The ability to reason across data and create automations and decision making processes from it (Operationalizing data differentiates PLTR from Snowflake and Databricks which focus on simple storage and basic data analytics). The second is the labor-intensive approach in which the company deploys engineers on-site to negotiate data access, clean that data and build extremely customizable and mission critical infrastructure (Creates high switching costs) To give a brief financial overview, PLTR expects to report 2.8B in net sales, which translates to 2.2B (82.5% Gross Margin) in gross profit, 1B in EBIT (35.4% Operation Margin) and 950M in FCF (34.3% FCF Margin). Most recently PLTR reported revenue of 678.1M (up 27% YoY), beating consensus by 3.8% (563.2M). Guidance was raised 4% for Q3 and 3% for FY2024. This seems aggressive considering that this raise in guidance is larger than the beat just posted. Thus, as expectations grow towards the moon, significant earnings beats will be required for PLTR to continue rising Investment Thesis: Markets are skewing towards exuberance on PLTR, pricing in absolute perfection and unachievable growth for 3 key reasons. First let’s get a lay of the land with valuation multiples. Palantir is trading at an exuberant valuation multiple of 39x sales, surpassing even the largest monopolies and industry players: NVIDIA, probably the hottest stock at the moment, has monopolized over 90% of the GPU market–a necessary prerequisite to our AI revolution, 62% operating margins and revenue growth of 126% in 2024E trades at 35x sales. Databricks, the current leader in data analytics, traded at about 26x sales (And this was during the peak of the SaaS market when Q4 2023 earnings faked out investors). Snowflake, often considered overvalued by investors, trades at around 11x sales. So–Does Palantir have a stronger monopoly than Nvidia, more recurring revenue than Databricks, stickier revenue than Snowflake? The answer is no. Proponents of PLTR often tout individual cases of companies loving their product, but let’s look at it from the top. Net Revenue Retention (NRR) is one of the most popular KPI’s for SaaS companies, essentially saying do customers spend more every year on the product? In other words, have customers loved the product so much that they increase their usage the next year? The answer for PLTR–kind of? Palantir's NRR stands at approximately 110%, down from 115% two years earlier, demonstrating a poor ability to upsell and retain customers. In contrast, Snowflake boasts an NRR of 130% this year and 150% last year when its EV/Sales multiple was at 10x and 20x respectively. This suggests that cheaper competitors not only have higher revenue quality but also more robust growth prospects. Next, let’s look at if the current growth prospects are even justified: Unfortunately, Palantir's commercial customer growth is already slowing. A few notes here: Firstly, The number of new commercial customers added has declined from 57 in Q1 to 39 in Q2. Secondly, Palantir's Bootcamp program, which aims to onboard new customers, has seen participant numbers drop from around 350 to about 110. Thirdly, the last beat on commercial revenue was largely due to one-time boosts in revenue (For example, they invested into a few SPAC’s previously as they were using foundry, which did quite well) On the government side, growth has been pretty strong (Though not strong enough) and drove almost 100% of the consensus beat. However, management noted that the segment benefited the “favorable” deal timing dynamics, implying potential growth slowdown in future quarters. Furthermore, margins are likely to be depressed in the next few earnings calls: PLTR has announced the release of a new product recently. Analysts noted that this would depress margins in the upcoming report. However, an additional feature was announced 3 weeks ago that likely had significant opex expenses associated that haven’t been priced in considering recent rallies in the stock. Finally, there is increasing competition in the AI analytics space (Think Databricks, Snowflake and even companies like Airtable), making it easier and easier to process and operationalize unstructured data. At the end of the day, there simply aren’t that many use cases for an extremely expensive labor intensive service, which cannot move downmarket no matter how well-loved the service is (As well to organizations with well endowed data science teams). The realization of any of these notes in earnings reports as well as a resolution in any of the geopolitical issues that the US is attached to today could be a turn in investor sentiment and enormous room to the downside. Additionally, macro risks to enterprise spending, intensified by the enormous cost of PLTR’s service create more downside risk. Valuation: Based on a DCF analysis, to justify PLTR’s current pricing, the company needs to expand operating margin 6% by 2029, actually accelerate to a 30% growth rate (from 24%) by 2027 through 2029 as well as maintain a 20x EV/sales multiple (Assumed 14.5% discount rate). However, even in a bull case where we model a 2% beat on consensus revenue annually, and 6% margin expansion by 2029, we still arrive at $35 per share, a 20% drop from current levels. Risk Factors: The biggest risk here is related to the government sector. Specifically the DoD outlines in its 2024 plan a shift to larger-scale implementation and a focus on data and overall modernization of systems. This sounds like the DoD and PLTR are pretty lovey dovey, which could potentially spell higher valuations. Further, the escalation of more dormant issues, like that of China and Taiwan could lead to higher than expected spending and therefore contract signings. Unexpected commercial strength could also occur. Strong enterprise SaaS spending as rates drop could accelerate sales as well as new product launches. For example, Physical AI applications with the new Live Edge platform (focusing on manufacturing use cases) have been added. However, this is unlikely to bring in revenue until later in 2025. To hedge against these risks, we could purchase call options, long various paired stocks or set a stop loss.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999,0.5,0.999

Thus, as expectations grow towards the moon, significant earnings beats will be required for PLTR to continue rising Investment Thesis: Markets are skewing towards exuberance on PLTR, pricing in absolute perfection and unachievable growth for 3 key reasons. First let’s get a lay of the land with valuation multiples. Palantir is trading at an exuberant valuation multiple of 39x sales, surpassing even the largest monopolies and industry players: NVIDIA, probably the hottest stock at the moment, has monopolized over 90% of the GPU market–a necessary prerequisite to our AI revolution, 62% operating margins and revenue growth of 126% in 2024E trades at 35x sales. Databricks, the current leader in data analytics, traded at about 26x sales (And this was during the peak of the SaaS market when Q4 2023 earnings faked out investors). Snowflake, often considered overvalued by investors, trades at around 11x sales. So–Does Palantir have a stronger monopoly than Nvidia, more recurring revenue than Databricks, stickier revenue than Snowflake? The answer is no. Proponents of PLTR often tout individual cases of companies loving their product, but let’s look at it from the top. Net Revenue Retention (NRR) is one of the most popular KPI’s for SaaS companies, essentially saying do customers spend more every year on the product? In other words, have customers loved the product so much that they increase their usage the next year? The answer for PLTR–kind of? Palantir's NRR stands at approximately 110%, down from 115% two years earlier, demonstrating a poor ability to upsell and retain customers. In contrast, Snowflake boasts an NRR of 130% this year and 150% last year when its EV/Sales multiple was at 10x and 20x respectively. This suggests that cheaper competitors not only have higher revenue quality but also more robust growth prospects. Next, let’s look at if the current growth prospects are even justified: Unfortunately, Palantir's commercial customer growth is already slowing. A few notes here: Firstly, The number of new commercial customers added has declined from 57 in Q1 to 39 in Q2. Secondly, Palantir's Bootcamp program, which aims to onboard new customers, has seen participant numbers drop from around 350 to about 110. Thirdly, the last beat on commercial revenue was largely due to one-time boosts in revenue (For example, they invested into a few SPAC’s previously as they were using foundry, which did quite well) On the government side, growth has been pretty strong (Though not strong enough) and drove almost 100% of the consensus beat. However, management noted that the segment benefited the “favorable” deal timing dynamics, implying potential growth slowdown in future quarters. Furthermore, margins are likely to be depressed in the next few earnings calls: PLTR has announced the release of a new product recently. Analysts noted that this would depress margins in the upcoming report. However, an additional feature was announced 3 weeks ago that likely had significant opex expenses associated that haven’t been priced in considering recent rallies in the stock. Finally, there is increasing competition in the AI analytics space (Think Databricks, Snowflake and even companies like Airtable), making it easier and easier to process and operationalize unstructured data. At the end of the day, there simply aren’t that many use cases for an extremely expensive labor intensive service, which cannot move downmarket no matter how well-loved the service is (As well to organizations with well endowed data science teams). The realization of any of these notes in earnings reports as well as a resolution in any of the geopolitical issues that the US is attached to today could be a turn in investor sentiment and enormous room to the downside. Additionally, macro risks to enterprise spending, intensified by the enormous cost of PLTR’s service create more downside risk. Valuation: Based on a DCF analysis, to justify PLTR’s current pricing, the company needs to expand operating margin 6% by 2029, actually accelerate to a 30% growth rate (from 24%) by 2027 through 2029 as well as maintain a 20x EV/sales multiple (Assumed 14.5% discount rate). However, even in a bull case where we model a 2% beat on consensus revenue annually, and 6% margin expansion by 2029, we still arrive at $35 per share, a 20% drop from current levels. Risk Factors: The biggest risk here is related to the government sector. Specifically the DoD outlines in its 2024 plan a shift to larger-scale implementation and a focus on data and overall modernization of systems. This sounds like the DoD and PLTR are pretty lovey dovey, which could potentially spell higher valuations. Further, the escalation of more dormant issues, like that of China and Taiwan could lead to higher than expected spending and therefore contract signings. Unexpected commercial strength could also occur. Strong enterprise SaaS spending as rates drop could accelerate sales as well as new product launches. For example, Physical AI applications with the new Live Edge platform (focusing on manufacturing use cases) have been added. However, this is unlikely to bring in revenue until later in 2025. To hedge against these risks, we could purchase call options, long various paired stocks or set a stop loss.","Regardless of Insider Selling, PLTR still won’t beat earnings enough to increase. Last earnings beat was 80% due to government revenue (36M out of 44M beat). They said themselves that was due to serendipitous timing. Commercial is also slowing down and they’re already realized much of their investment returns (Without that one-time realization of investment returns they wouldn’t have beat on commercial revenue at all last report). Thus they’re unlikely to beat on revenue this time and margins are likely to not be ideal due to unexpected new product launches.",3,0.56,NEGATIVE,0.995,0.56,0.995
,"Had a pitch on PLTR from last Friday. Now that there’s this much insider selling that’s the nail in the coffin. Here’s the pitch for those interested: Recommendation: I recommend a short on Palantir Technologies. The stock is currently priced at $44.79 per share, which I believe will drop by about 20-30% in the next 6–12 months. This is because, the market is highly exuberant in regards to PLTR, pricing in extreme growth rates despite signs of stunting commercial growth. Additionally, overreliance on cyclical government contracts as well as downward pressure on margins due to new AI product launches has led me to believe PLTR is overvalued, which I will prove via this pitch. Company Background: Palantir at its core is a company that focuses on data-analytics, specializing in integrating large amounts of data and operationalizing that data for the public and private sectors. Its speciality lies in the extreme flexibility it provides customers in the form of Forward Deployed Engineers (FDE’s), who can create bespoke AI solutions for any customer. The key platforms are: Gotham, a government intelligence and geospatial platform that is meant to analyze data from various sources to help support military operations and disaster response. Foundry, the commercial segment of the business: This begins with the cleaning and structuring of data, which leads into the integration of this data into AI models (AIP). These models are meant to operationalize company data improving top level decision making. Apollo integrates these systems delivering infrastructure and continual updates. The advantage of this system is two-fold: First is the “ontology”, an effective digital twin of the business, which allows 1. collaboration across departments and 2. The ability to reason across data and create automations and decision making processes from it (Operationalizing data differentiates PLTR from Snowflake and Databricks which focus on simple storage and basic data analytics). The second is the labor-intensive approach in which the company deploys engineers on-site to negotiate data access, clean that data and build extremely customizable and mission critical infrastructure (Creates high switching costs) To give a brief financial overview, PLTR expects to report 2.8B in net sales, which translates to 2.2B (82.5% Gross Margin) in gross profit, 1B in EBIT (35.4% Operation Margin) and 950M in FCF (34.3% FCF Margin). Most recently PLTR reported revenue of 678.1M (up 27% YoY), beating consensus by 3.8% (563.2M). Guidance was raised 4% for Q3 and 3% for FY2024.

This suggests that cheaper competitors not only have higher revenue quality but also more robust growth prospects. Next, let’s look at if the current growth prospects are even justified: Unfortunately, Palantir's commercial customer growth is already slowing. A few notes here: Firstly, The number of new commercial customers added has declined from 57 in Q1 to 39 in Q2. Secondly, Palantir's Bootcamp program, which aims to onboard new customers, has seen participant numbers drop from around 350 to about 110. Thirdly, the last beat on commercial revenue was largely due to one-time boosts in revenue (For example, they invested into a few SPAC’s previously as they were using foundry, which did quite well) On the government side, growth has been pretty strong (Though not strong enough) and drove almost 100% of the consensus beat. However, management noted that the segment benefited the “favorable” deal timing dynamics, implying potential growth slowdown in future quarters. Furthermore, margins are likely to be depressed in the next few earnings calls: PLTR has announced the release of a new product recently. Analysts noted that this would depress margins in the upcoming report. However, an additional feature was announced 3 weeks ago that likely had significant opex expenses associated that haven’t been priced in considering recent rallies in the stock. Finally, there is increasing competition in the AI analytics space (Think Databricks, Snowflake and even companies like Airtable), making it easier and easier to process and operationalize unstructured data. At the end of the day, there simply aren’t that many use cases for an extremely expensive labor intensive service, which cannot move downmarket no matter how well-loved the service is (As well to organizations with well endowed data science teams). The realization of any of these notes in earnings reports as well as a resolution in any of the geopolitical issues that the US is attached to today could be a turn in investor sentiment and enormous room to the downside. Additionally, macro risks to enterprise spending, intensified by the enormous cost of PLTR’s service create more downside risk. Valuation: Based on a DCF analysis, to justify PLTR’s current pricing, the company needs to expand operating margin 6% by 2029, actually accelerate to a 30% growth rate (from 24%) by 2027 through 2029 as well as maintain a 20x EV/sales multiple (Assumed 14.5% discount rate). However, even in a bull case where we model a 2% beat on consensus revenue annually, and 6% margin expansion by 2029, we still arrive at $35 per share, a 20% drop from current levels. Risk Factors: The biggest risk here is related to the government sector. Specifically the DoD outlines in its 2024 plan a shift to larger-scale implementation and a focus on data and overall modernization of systems. This sounds like the DoD and PLTR are pretty lovey dovey, which could potentially spell higher valuations. Further, the escalation of more dormant issues, like that of China and Taiwan could lead to higher than expected spending and therefore contract signings. Unexpected commercial strength could also occur. Strong enterprise SaaS spending as rates drop could accelerate sales as well as new product launches. For example, Physical AI applications with the new Live Edge platform (focusing on manufacturing use cases) have been added. However, this is unlikely to bring in revenue until later in 2025. To hedge against these risks, we could purchase call options, long various paired stocks or set a stop loss.",It’s just keep scrolling down with my finger haha,1,0.504,NEGATIVE,0.973,0.504,0.973
,"Had a pitch on PLTR from last Friday. Now that there’s this much insider selling that’s the nail in the coffin. Here’s the pitch for those interested: Recommendation: I recommend a short on Palantir Technologies. The stock is currently priced at $44.79 per share, which I believe will drop by about 20-30% in the next 6–12 months. This is because, the market is highly exuberant in regards to PLTR, pricing in extreme growth rates despite signs of stunting commercial growth. Additionally, overreliance on cyclical government contracts as well as downward pressure on margins due to new AI product launches has led me to believe PLTR is overvalued, which I will prove via this pitch. Company Background: Palantir at its core is a company that focuses on data-analytics, specializing in integrating large amounts of data and operationalizing that data for the public and private sectors. Its speciality lies in the extreme flexibility it provides customers in the form of Forward Deployed Engineers (FDE’s), who can create bespoke AI solutions for any customer. The key platforms are: Gotham, a government intelligence and geospatial platform that is meant to analyze data from various sources to help support military operations and disaster response. Foundry, the commercial segment of the business: This begins with the cleaning and structuring of data, which leads into the integration of this data into AI models (AIP). These models are meant to operationalize company data improving top level decision making. Apollo integrates these systems delivering infrastructure and continual updates. The advantage of this system is two-fold: First is the “ontology”, an effective digital twin of the business, which allows 1. collaboration across departments and 2. The ability to reason across data and create automations and decision making processes from it (Operationalizing data differentiates PLTR from Snowflake and Databricks which focus on simple storage and basic data analytics). The second is the labor-intensive approach in which the company deploys engineers on-site to negotiate data access, clean that data and build extremely customizable and mission critical infrastructure (Creates high switching costs) To give a brief financial overview, PLTR expects to report 2.8B in net sales, which translates to 2.2B (82.5% Gross Margin) in gross profit, 1B in EBIT (35.4% Operation Margin) and 950M in FCF (34.3% FCF Margin). Most recently PLTR reported revenue of 678.1M (up 27% YoY), beating consensus by 3.8% (563.2M). Guidance was raised 4% for Q3 and 3% for FY2024. This seems aggressive considering that this raise in guidance is larger than the beat just posted. Thus, as expectations grow towards the moon, significant earnings beats will be required for PLTR to continue rising Investment Thesis: Markets are skewing towards exuberance on PLTR, pricing in absolute perfection and unachievable growth for 3 key reasons. First let’s get a lay of the land with valuation multiples. Palantir is trading at an exuberant valuation multiple of 39x sales, surpassing even the largest monopolies and industry players: NVIDIA, probably the hottest stock at the moment, has monopolized over 90% of the GPU market–a necessary prerequisite to our AI revolution, 62% operating margins and revenue growth of 126% in 2024E trades at 35x sales. Databricks, the current leader in data analytics, traded at about 26x sales (And this was during the peak of the SaaS market when Q4 2023 earnings faked out investors). Snowflake, often considered overvalued by investors, trades at around 11x sales. So–Does Palantir have a stronger monopoly than Nvidia, more recurring revenue than Databricks, stickier revenue than Snowflake? The answer is no. Proponents of PLTR often tout individual cases of companies loving their product, but let’s look at it from the top. Net Revenue Retention (NRR) is one of the most popular KPI’s for SaaS companies, essentially saying do customers spend more every year on the product? In other words, have customers loved the product so much that they increase their usage the next year? The answer for PLTR–kind of?

Valuation: Based on a DCF analysis, to justify PLTR’s current pricing, the company needs to expand operating margin 6% by 2029, actually accelerate to a 30% growth rate (from 24%) by 2027 through 2029 as well as maintain a 20x EV/sales multiple (Assumed 14.5% discount rate). However, even in a bull case where we model a 2% beat on consensus revenue annually, and 6% margin expansion by 2029, we still arrive at $35 per share, a 20% drop from current levels. Risk Factors: The biggest risk here is related to the government sector. Specifically the DoD outlines in its 2024 plan a shift to larger-scale implementation and a focus on data and overall modernization of systems. This sounds like the DoD and PLTR are pretty lovey dovey, which could potentially spell higher valuations. Further, the escalation of more dormant issues, like that of China and Taiwan could lead to higher than expected spending and therefore contract signings. Unexpected commercial strength could also occur. Strong enterprise SaaS spending as rates drop could accelerate sales as well as new product launches. For example, Physical AI applications with the new Live Edge platform (focusing on manufacturing use cases) have been added. However, this is unlikely to bring in revenue until later in 2025. To hedge against these risks, we could purchase call options, long various paired stocks or set a stop loss.","Worst post everNo spaces, no paragraphs, no formatting",0,0.501,NEGATIVE,1.0,0.501,1.0
,"Had a pitch on PLTR from last Friday. Now that there’s this much insider selling that’s the nail in the coffin. Here’s the pitch for those interested: Recommendation: I recommend a short on Palantir Technologies. The stock is currently priced at $44.79 per share, which I believe will drop by about 20-30% in the next 6–12 months. This is because, the market is highly exuberant in regards to PLTR, pricing in extreme growth rates despite signs of stunting commercial growth. Additionally, overreliance on cyclical government contracts as well as downward pressure on margins due to new AI product launches has led me to believe PLTR is overvalued, which I will prove via this pitch. Company Background: Palantir at its core is a company that focuses on data-analytics, specializing in integrating large amounts of data and operationalizing that data for the public and private sectors. Its speciality lies in the extreme flexibility it provides customers in the form of Forward Deployed Engineers (FDE’s), who can create bespoke AI solutions for any customer. The key platforms are: Gotham, a government intelligence and geospatial platform that is meant to analyze data from various sources to help support military operations and disaster response. Foundry, the commercial segment of the business: This begins with the cleaning and structuring of data, which leads into the integration of this data into AI models (AIP). These models are meant to operationalize company data improving top level decision making. Apollo integrates these systems delivering infrastructure and continual updates. The advantage of this system is two-fold: First is the “ontology”, an effective digital twin of the business, which allows 1. collaboration across departments and 2. The ability to reason across data and create automations and decision making processes from it (Operationalizing data differentiates PLTR from Snowflake and Databricks which focus on simple storage and basic data analytics). The second is the labor-intensive approach in which the company deploys engineers on-site to negotiate data access, clean that data and build extremely customizable and mission critical infrastructure (Creates high switching costs) To give a brief financial overview, PLTR expects to report 2.8B in net sales, which translates to 2.2B (82.5% Gross Margin) in gross profit, 1B in EBIT (35.4% Operation Margin) and 950M in FCF (34.3% FCF Margin). Most recently PLTR reported revenue of 678.1M (up 27% YoY), beating consensus by 3.8% (563.2M). Guidance was raised 4% for Q3 and 3% for FY2024. This seems aggressive considering that this raise in guidance is larger than the beat just posted. Thus, as expectations grow towards the moon, significant earnings beats will be required for PLTR to continue rising Investment Thesis: Markets are skewing towards exuberance on PLTR, pricing in absolute perfection and unachievable growth for 3 key reasons. First let’s get a lay of the land with valuation multiples. Palantir is trading at an exuberant valuation multiple of 39x sales, surpassing even the largest monopolies and industry players: NVIDIA, probably the hottest stock at the moment, has monopolized over 90% of the GPU market–a necessary prerequisite to our AI revolution, 62% operating margins and revenue growth of 126% in 2024E trades at 35x sales. Databricks, the current leader in data analytics, traded at about 26x sales (And this was during the peak of the SaaS market when Q4 2023 earnings faked out investors). Snowflake, often considered overvalued by investors, trades at around 11x sales. So–Does Palantir have a stronger monopoly than Nvidia, more recurring revenue than Databricks, stickier revenue than Snowflake? The answer is no. Proponents of PLTR often tout individual cases of companies loving their product, but let’s look at it from the top. Net Revenue Retention (NRR) is one of the most popular KPI’s for SaaS companies, essentially saying do customers spend more every year on the product? In other words, have customers loved the product so much that they increase their usage the next year? The answer for PLTR–kind of? Palantir's NRR stands at approximately 110%, down from 115% two years earlier, demonstrating a poor ability to upsell and retain customers. In contrast, Snowflake boasts an NRR of 130% this year and 150% last year when its EV/Sales multiple was at 10x and 20x respectively. This suggests that cheaper competitors not only have higher revenue quality but also more robust growth prospects. Next, let’s look at if the current growth prospects are even justified: Unfortunately, Palantir's commercial customer growth is already slowing. A few notes here: Firstly, The number of new commercial customers added has declined from 57 in Q1 to 39 in Q2. Secondly, Palantir's Bootcamp program, which aims to onboard new customers, has seen participant numbers drop from around 350 to about 110. Thirdly, the last beat on commercial revenue was largely due to one-time boosts in revenue (For example, they invested into a few SPAC’s previously as they were using foundry, which did quite well) On the government side, growth has been pretty strong (Though not strong enough) and drove almost 100% of the consensus beat. However, management noted that the segment benefited the “favorable” deal timing dynamics, implying potential growth slowdown in future quarters. Furthermore, margins are likely to be depressed in the next few earnings calls: PLTR has announced the release of a new product recently. Analysts noted that this would depress margins in the upcoming report. However, an additional feature was announced 3 weeks ago that likely had significant opex expenses associated that haven’t been priced in considering recent rallies in the stock. Finally, there is increasing competition in the AI analytics space (Think Databricks, Snowflake and even companies like Airtable), making it easier and easier to process and operationalize unstructured data. At the end of the day, there simply aren’t that many use cases for an extremely expensive labor intensive service, which cannot move downmarket no matter how well-loved the service is (As well to organizations with well endowed data science teams). The realization of any of these notes in earnings reports as well as a resolution in any of the geopolitical issues that the US is attached to today could be a turn in investor sentiment and enormous room to the downside. Additionally, macro risks to enterprise spending, intensified by the enormous cost of PLTR’s service create more downside risk.

Its speciality lies in the extreme flexibility it provides customers in the form of Forward Deployed Engineers (FDE’s), who can create bespoke AI solutions for any customer. The key platforms are: Gotham, a government intelligence and geospatial platform that is meant to analyze data from various sources to help support military operations and disaster response. Foundry, the commercial segment of the business: This begins with the cleaning and structuring of data, which leads into the integration of this data into AI models (AIP). These models are meant to operationalize company data improving top level decision making. Apollo integrates these systems delivering infrastructure and continual updates. The advantage of this system is two-fold: First is the “ontology”, an effective digital twin of the business, which allows 1. collaboration across departments and 2. The ability to reason across data and create automations and decision making processes from it (Operationalizing data differentiates PLTR from Snowflake and Databricks which focus on simple storage and basic data analytics). The second is the labor-intensive approach in which the company deploys engineers on-site to negotiate data access, clean that data and build extremely customizable and mission critical infrastructure (Creates high switching costs) To give a brief financial overview, PLTR expects to report 2.8B in net sales, which translates to 2.2B (82.5% Gross Margin) in gross profit, 1B in EBIT (35.4% Operation Margin) and 950M in FCF (34.3% FCF Margin). Most recently PLTR reported revenue of 678.1M (up 27% YoY), beating consensus by 3.8% (563.2M). Guidance was raised 4% for Q3 and 3% for FY2024. This seems aggressive considering that this raise in guidance is larger than the beat just posted. Thus, as expectations grow towards the moon, significant earnings beats will be required for PLTR to continue rising Investment Thesis: Markets are skewing towards exuberance on PLTR, pricing in absolute perfection and unachievable growth for 3 key reasons. First let’s get a lay of the land with valuation multiples. Palantir is trading at an exuberant valuation multiple of 39x sales, surpassing even the largest monopolies and industry players: NVIDIA, probably the hottest stock at the moment, has monopolized over 90% of the GPU market–a necessary prerequisite to our AI revolution, 62% operating margins and revenue growth of 126% in 2024E trades at 35x sales. Databricks, the current leader in data analytics, traded at about 26x sales (And this was during the peak of the SaaS market when Q4 2023 earnings faked out investors). Snowflake, often considered overvalued by investors, trades at around 11x sales. So–Does Palantir have a stronger monopoly than Nvidia, more recurring revenue than Databricks, stickier revenue than Snowflake? The answer is no. Proponents of PLTR often tout individual cases of companies loving their product, but let’s look at it from the top. Net Revenue Retention (NRR) is one of the most popular KPI’s for SaaS companies, essentially saying do customers spend more every year on the product? In other words, have customers loved the product so much that they increase their usage the next year? The answer for PLTR–kind of? Palantir's NRR stands at approximately 110%, down from 115% two years earlier, demonstrating a poor ability to upsell and retain customers. In contrast, Snowflake boasts an NRR of 130% this year and 150% last year when its EV/Sales multiple was at 10x and 20x respectively. This suggests that cheaper competitors not only have higher revenue quality but also more robust growth prospects. Next, let’s look at if the current growth prospects are even justified: Unfortunately, Palantir's commercial customer growth is already slowing. A few notes here: Firstly, The number of new commercial customers added has declined from 57 in Q1 to 39 in Q2. Secondly, Palantir's Bootcamp program, which aims to onboard new customers, has seen participant numbers drop from around 350 to about 110. Thirdly, the last beat on commercial revenue was largely due to one-time boosts in revenue (For example, they invested into a few SPAC’s previously as they were using foundry, which did quite well) On the government side, growth has been pretty strong (Though not strong enough) and drove almost 100% of the consensus beat. However, management noted that the segment benefited the “favorable” deal timing dynamics, implying potential growth slowdown in future quarters. Furthermore, margins are likely to be depressed in the next few earnings calls: PLTR has announced the release of a new product recently. Analysts noted that this would depress margins in the upcoming report. However, an additional feature was announced 3 weeks ago that likely had significant opex expenses associated that haven’t been priced in considering recent rallies in the stock. Finally, there is increasing competition in the AI analytics space (Think Databricks, Snowflake and even companies like Airtable), making it easier and easier to process and operationalize unstructured data. At the end of the day, there simply aren’t that many use cases for an extremely expensive labor intensive service, which cannot move downmarket no matter how well-loved the service is (As well to organizations with well endowed data science teams). The realization of any of these notes in earnings reports as well as a resolution in any of the geopolitical issues that the US is attached to today could be a turn in investor sentiment and enormous room to the downside. Additionally, macro risks to enterprise spending, intensified by the enormous cost of PLTR’s service create more downside risk. Valuation: Based on a DCF analysis, to justify PLTR’s current pricing, the company needs to expand operating margin 6% by 2029, actually accelerate to a 30% growth rate (from 24%) by 2027 through 2029 as well as maintain a 20x EV/sales multiple (Assumed 14.5% discount rate). However, even in a bull case where we model a 2% beat on consensus revenue annually, and 6% margin expansion by 2029, we still arrive at $35 per share, a 20% drop from current levels. Risk Factors: The biggest risk here is related to the government sector. Specifically the DoD outlines in its 2024 plan a shift to larger-scale implementation and a focus on data and overall modernization of systems. This sounds like the DoD and PLTR are pretty lovey dovey, which could potentially spell higher valuations. Further, the escalation of more dormant issues, like that of China and Taiwan could lead to higher than expected spending and therefore contract signings. Unexpected commercial strength could also occur. Strong enterprise SaaS spending as rates drop could accelerate sales as well as new product launches. For example, Physical AI applications with the new Live Edge platform (focusing on manufacturing use cases) have been added. However, this is unlikely to bring in revenue until later in 2025. To hedge against these risks, we could purchase call options, long various paired stocks or set a stop loss.",Al knows about paragraphs and the carriage return key,0,0.51,POSITIVE,0.984,0.51,0.984
,"Had a pitch on PLTR from last Friday. Now that there’s this much insider selling that’s the nail in the coffin. Here’s the pitch for those interested: Recommendation: I recommend a short on Palantir Technologies. The stock is currently priced at $44.79 per share, which I believe will drop by about 20-30% in the next 6–12 months. This is because, the market is highly exuberant in regards to PLTR, pricing in extreme growth rates despite signs of stunting commercial growth.

Databricks, the current leader in data analytics, traded at about 26x sales (And this was during the peak of the SaaS market when Q4 2023 earnings faked out investors). Snowflake, often considered overvalued by investors, trades at around 11x sales. So–Does Palantir have a stronger monopoly than Nvidia, more recurring revenue than Databricks, stickier revenue than Snowflake? The answer is no. Proponents of PLTR often tout individual cases of companies loving their product, but let’s look at it from the top. Net Revenue Retention (NRR) is one of the most popular KPI’s for SaaS companies, essentially saying do customers spend more every year on the product? In other words, have customers loved the product so much that they increase their usage the next year? The answer for PLTR–kind of? Palantir's NRR stands at approximately 110%, down from 115% two years earlier, demonstrating a poor ability to upsell and retain customers. In contrast, Snowflake boasts an NRR of 130% this year and 150% last year when its EV/Sales multiple was at 10x and 20x respectively. This suggests that cheaper competitors not only have higher revenue quality but also more robust growth prospects. Next, let’s look at if the current growth prospects are even justified: Unfortunately, Palantir's commercial customer growth is already slowing. A few notes here: Firstly, The number of new commercial customers added has declined from 57 in Q1 to 39 in Q2. Secondly, Palantir's Bootcamp program, which aims to onboard new customers, has seen participant numbers drop from around 350 to about 110. Thirdly, the last beat on commercial revenue was largely due to one-time boosts in revenue (For example, they invested into a few SPAC’s previously as they were using foundry, which did quite well) On the government side, growth has been pretty strong (Though not strong enough) and drove almost 100% of the consensus beat. However, management noted that the segment benefited the “favorable” deal timing dynamics, implying potential growth slowdown in future quarters. Furthermore, margins are likely to be depressed in the next few earnings calls: PLTR has announced the release of a new product recently. Analysts noted that this would depress margins in the upcoming report. However, an additional feature was announced 3 weeks ago that likely had significant opex expenses associated that haven’t been priced in considering recent rallies in the stock. Finally, there is increasing competition in the AI analytics space (Think Databricks, Snowflake and even companies like Airtable), making it easier and easier to process and operationalize unstructured data. At the end of the day, there simply aren’t that many use cases for an extremely expensive labor intensive service, which cannot move downmarket no matter how well-loved the service is (As well to organizations with well endowed data science teams). The realization of any of these notes in earnings reports as well as a resolution in any of the geopolitical issues that the US is attached to today could be a turn in investor sentiment and enormous room to the downside. Additionally, macro risks to enterprise spending, intensified by the enormous cost of PLTR’s service create more downside risk. Valuation: Based on a DCF analysis, to justify PLTR’s current pricing, the company needs to expand operating margin 6% by 2029, actually accelerate to a 30% growth rate (from 24%) by 2027 through 2029 as well as maintain a 20x EV/sales multiple (Assumed 14.5% discount rate). However, even in a bull case where we model a 2% beat on consensus revenue annually, and 6% margin expansion by 2029, we still arrive at $35 per share, a 20% drop from current levels. Risk Factors: The biggest risk here is related to the government sector. Specifically the DoD outlines in its 2024 plan a shift to larger-scale implementation and a focus on data and overall modernization of systems. This sounds like the DoD and PLTR are pretty lovey dovey, which could potentially spell higher valuations. Further, the escalation of more dormant issues, like that of China and Taiwan could lead to higher than expected spending and therefore contract signings. Unexpected commercial strength could also occur. Strong enterprise SaaS spending as rates drop could accelerate sales as well as new product launches. For example, Physical AI applications with the new Live Edge platform (focusing on manufacturing use cases) have been added. However, this is unlikely to bring in revenue until later in 2025. To hedge against these risks, we could purchase call options, long various paired stocks or set a stop loss.",PE isn’t a good metric for growth companies anyway,1,0.56,NEGATIVE,1.0,0.56,1.0
,"Had a pitch on PLTR from last Friday. Now that there’s this much insider selling that’s the nail in the coffin. Here’s the pitch for those interested: Recommendation: I recommend a short on Palantir Technologies. The stock is currently priced at $44.79 per share, which I believe will drop by about 20-30% in the next 6–12 months. This is because, the market is highly exuberant in regards to PLTR, pricing in extreme growth rates despite signs of stunting commercial growth. Additionally, overreliance on cyclical government contracts as well as downward pressure on margins due to new AI product launches has led me to believe PLTR is overvalued, which I will prove via this pitch. Company Background: Palantir at its core is a company that focuses on data-analytics, specializing in integrating large amounts of data and operationalizing that data for the public and private sectors. Its speciality lies in the extreme flexibility it provides customers in the form of Forward Deployed Engineers (FDE’s), who can create bespoke AI solutions for any customer. The key platforms are: Gotham, a government intelligence and geospatial platform that is meant to analyze data from various sources to help support military operations and disaster response. Foundry, the commercial segment of the business: This begins with the cleaning and structuring of data, which leads into the integration of this data into AI models (AIP). These models are meant to operationalize company data improving top level decision making. Apollo integrates these systems delivering infrastructure and continual updates. The advantage of this system is two-fold: First is the “ontology”, an effective digital twin of the business, which allows 1. collaboration across departments and 2. The ability to reason across data and create automations and decision making processes from it (Operationalizing data differentiates PLTR from Snowflake and Databricks which focus on simple storage and basic data analytics). The second is the labor-intensive approach in which the company deploys engineers on-site to negotiate data access, clean that data and build extremely customizable and mission critical infrastructure (Creates high switching costs) To give a brief financial overview, PLTR expects to report 2.8B in net sales, which translates to 2.2B (82.5% Gross Margin) in gross profit, 1B in EBIT (35.4% Operation Margin) and 950M in FCF (34.3% FCF Margin). Most recently PLTR reported revenue of 678.1M (up 27% YoY), beating consensus by 3.8% (563.2M). Guidance was raised 4% for Q3 and 3% for FY2024. This seems aggressive considering that this raise in guidance is larger than the beat just posted. Thus, as expectations grow towards the moon, significant earnings beats will be required for PLTR to continue rising Investment Thesis: Markets are skewing towards exuberance on PLTR, pricing in absolute perfection and unachievable growth for 3 key reasons.

Analysts noted that this would depress margins in the upcoming report. However, an additional feature was announced 3 weeks ago that likely had significant opex expenses associated that haven’t been priced in considering recent rallies in the stock. Finally, there is increasing competition in the AI analytics space (Think Databricks, Snowflake and even companies like Airtable), making it easier and easier to process and operationalize unstructured data. At the end of the day, there simply aren’t that many use cases for an extremely expensive labor intensive service, which cannot move downmarket no matter how well-loved the service is (As well to organizations with well endowed data science teams). The realization of any of these notes in earnings reports as well as a resolution in any of the geopolitical issues that the US is attached to today could be a turn in investor sentiment and enormous room to the downside. Additionally, macro risks to enterprise spending, intensified by the enormous cost of PLTR’s service create more downside risk. Valuation: Based on a DCF analysis, to justify PLTR’s current pricing, the company needs to expand operating margin 6% by 2029, actually accelerate to a 30% growth rate (from 24%) by 2027 through 2029 as well as maintain a 20x EV/sales multiple (Assumed 14.5% discount rate). However, even in a bull case where we model a 2% beat on consensus revenue annually, and 6% margin expansion by 2029, we still arrive at $35 per share, a 20% drop from current levels. Risk Factors: The biggest risk here is related to the government sector. Specifically the DoD outlines in its 2024 plan a shift to larger-scale implementation and a focus on data and overall modernization of systems. This sounds like the DoD and PLTR are pretty lovey dovey, which could potentially spell higher valuations. Further, the escalation of more dormant issues, like that of China and Taiwan could lead to higher than expected spending and therefore contract signings. Unexpected commercial strength could also occur. Strong enterprise SaaS spending as rates drop could accelerate sales as well as new product launches. For example, Physical AI applications with the new Live Edge platform (focusing on manufacturing use cases) have been added. However, this is unlikely to bring in revenue until later in 2025. To hedge against these risks, we could purchase call options, long various paired stocks or set a stop loss.",nice paragraph,0,0.5,POSITIVE,0.953,0.5,0.953
,"Had a pitch on PLTR from last Friday. Now that there’s this much insider selling that’s the nail in the coffin. Here’s the pitch for those interested: Recommendation: I recommend a short on Palantir Technologies. The stock is currently priced at $44.79 per share, which I believe will drop by about 20-30% in the next 6–12 months. This is because, the market is highly exuberant in regards to PLTR, pricing in extreme growth rates despite signs of stunting commercial growth. Additionally, overreliance on cyclical government contracts as well as downward pressure on margins due to new AI product launches has led me to believe PLTR is overvalued, which I will prove via this pitch. Company Background: Palantir at its core is a company that focuses on data-analytics, specializing in integrating large amounts of data and operationalizing that data for the public and private sectors. Its speciality lies in the extreme flexibility it provides customers in the form of Forward Deployed Engineers (FDE’s), who can create bespoke AI solutions for any customer. The key platforms are: Gotham, a government intelligence and geospatial platform that is meant to analyze data from various sources to help support military operations and disaster response. Foundry, the commercial segment of the business: This begins with the cleaning and structuring of data, which leads into the integration of this data into AI models (AIP). These models are meant to operationalize company data improving top level decision making. Apollo integrates these systems delivering infrastructure and continual updates. The advantage of this system is two-fold: First is the “ontology”, an effective digital twin of the business, which allows 1. collaboration across departments and 2. The ability to reason across data and create automations and decision making processes from it (Operationalizing data differentiates PLTR from Snowflake and Databricks which focus on simple storage and basic data analytics). The second is the labor-intensive approach in which the company deploys engineers on-site to negotiate data access, clean that data and build extremely customizable and mission critical infrastructure (Creates high switching costs) To give a brief financial overview, PLTR expects to report 2.8B in net sales, which translates to 2.2B (82.5% Gross Margin) in gross profit, 1B in EBIT (35.4% Operation Margin) and 950M in FCF (34.3% FCF Margin). Most recently PLTR reported revenue of 678.1M (up 27% YoY), beating consensus by 3.8% (563.2M). Guidance was raised 4% for Q3 and 3% for FY2024. This seems aggressive considering that this raise in guidance is larger than the beat just posted. Thus, as expectations grow towards the moon, significant earnings beats will be required for PLTR to continue rising Investment Thesis: Markets are skewing towards exuberance on PLTR, pricing in absolute perfection and unachievable growth for 3 key reasons. First let’s get a lay of the land with valuation multiples. Palantir is trading at an exuberant valuation multiple of 39x sales, surpassing even the largest monopolies and industry players: NVIDIA, probably the hottest stock at the moment, has monopolized over 90% of the GPU market–a necessary prerequisite to our AI revolution, 62% operating margins and revenue growth of 126% in 2024E trades at 35x sales. Databricks, the current leader in data analytics, traded at about 26x sales (And this was during the peak of the SaaS market when Q4 2023 earnings faked out investors). Snowflake, often considered overvalued by investors, trades at around 11x sales. So–Does Palantir have a stronger monopoly than Nvidia, more recurring revenue than Databricks, stickier revenue than Snowflake? The answer is no. Proponents of PLTR often tout individual cases of companies loving their product, but let’s look at it from the top. Net Revenue Retention (NRR) is one of the most popular KPI’s for SaaS companies, essentially saying do customers spend more every year on the product? In other words, have customers loved the product so much that they increase their usage the next year? The answer for PLTR–kind of? Palantir's NRR stands at approximately 110%, down from 115% two years earlier, demonstrating a poor ability to upsell and retain customers. In contrast, Snowflake boasts an NRR of 130% this year and 150% last year when its EV/Sales multiple was at 10x and 20x respectively. This suggests that cheaper competitors not only have higher revenue quality but also more robust growth prospects. Next, let’s look at if the current growth prospects are even justified: Unfortunately, Palantir's commercial customer growth is already slowing. A few notes here: Firstly, The number of new commercial customers added has declined from 57 in Q1 to 39 in Q2. Secondly, Palantir's Bootcamp program, which aims to onboard new customers, has seen participant numbers drop from around 350 to about 110. Thirdly, the last beat on commercial revenue was largely due to one-time boosts in revenue (For example, they invested into a few SPAC’s previously as they were using foundry, which did quite well) On the government side, growth has been pretty strong (Though not strong enough) and drove almost 100% of the consensus beat. However, management noted that the segment benefited the “favorable” deal timing dynamics, implying potential growth slowdown in future quarters. Furthermore, margins are likely to be depressed in the next few earnings calls: PLTR has announced the release of a new product recently.

,"Had a pitch on PLTR from last Friday. Now that there’s this much insider selling that’s the nail in the coffin. Here’s the pitch for those interested: Recommendation: I recommend a short on Palantir Technologies. The stock is currently priced at $44.79 per share, which I believe will drop by about 20-30% in the next 6–12 months. This is because, the market is highly exuberant in regards to PLTR, pricing in extreme growth rates despite signs of stunting commercial growth. Additionally, overreliance on cyclical government contracts as well as downward pressure on margins due to new AI product launches has led me to believe PLTR is overvalued, which I will prove via this pitch. Company Background: Palantir at its core is a company that focuses on data-analytics, specializing in integrating large amounts of data and operationalizing that data for the public and private sectors. Its speciality lies in the extreme flexibility it provides customers in the form of Forward Deployed Engineers (FDE’s), who can create bespoke AI solutions for any customer. The key platforms are: Gotham, a government intelligence and geospatial platform that is meant to analyze data from various sources to help support military operations and disaster response. Foundry, the commercial segment of the business: This begins with the cleaning and structuring of data, which leads into the integration of this data into AI models (AIP). These models are meant to operationalize company data improving top level decision making. Apollo integrates these systems delivering infrastructure and continual updates. The advantage of this system is two-fold: First is the “ontology”, an effective digital twin of the business, which allows 1. collaboration across departments and 2. The ability to reason across data and create automations and decision making processes from it (Operationalizing data differentiates PLTR from Snowflake and Databricks which focus on simple storage and basic data analytics). The second is the labor-intensive approach in which the company deploys engineers on-site to negotiate data access, clean that data and build extremely customizable and mission critical infrastructure (Creates high switching costs) To give a brief financial overview, PLTR expects to report 2.8B in net sales, which translates to 2.2B (82.5% Gross Margin) in gross profit, 1B in EBIT (35.4% Operation Margin) and 950M in FCF (34.3% FCF Margin). Most recently PLTR reported revenue of 678.1M (up 27% YoY), beating consensus by 3.8% (563.2M). Guidance was raised 4% for Q3 and 3% for FY2024. This seems aggressive considering that this raise in guidance is larger than the beat just posted. Thus, as expectations grow towards the moon, significant earnings beats will be required for PLTR to continue rising Investment Thesis: Markets are skewing towards exuberance on PLTR, pricing in absolute perfection and unachievable growth for 3 key reasons. First let’s get a lay of the land with valuation multiples. Palantir is trading at an exuberant valuation multiple of 39x sales, surpassing even the largest monopolies and industry players: NVIDIA, probably the hottest stock at the moment, has monopolized over 90% of the GPU market–a necessary prerequisite to our AI revolution, 62% operating margins and revenue growth of 126% in 2024E trades at 35x sales. Databricks, the current leader in data analytics, traded at about 26x sales (And this was during the peak of the SaaS market when Q4 2023 earnings faked out investors). Snowflake, often considered overvalued by investors, trades at around 11x sales. So–Does Palantir have a stronger monopoly than Nvidia, more recurring revenue than Databricks, stickier revenue than Snowflake? The answer is no. Proponents of PLTR often tout individual cases of companies loving their product, but let’s look at it from the top. Net Revenue Retention (NRR) is one of the most popular KPI’s for SaaS companies, essentially saying do customers spend more every year on the product? In other words, have customers loved the product so much that they increase their usage the next year? The answer for PLTR–kind of? Palantir's NRR stands at approximately 110%, down from 115% two years earlier, demonstrating a poor ability to upsell and retain customers. In contrast, Snowflake boasts an NRR of 130% this year and 150% last year when its EV/Sales multiple was at 10x and 20x respectively. This suggests that cheaper competitors not only have higher revenue quality but also more robust growth prospects. Next, let’s look at if the current growth prospects are even justified: Unfortunately, Palantir's commercial customer growth is already slowing. A few notes here: Firstly, The number of new commercial customers added has declined from 57 in Q1 to 39 in Q2. Secondly, Palantir's Bootcamp program, which aims to onboard new customers, has seen participant numbers drop from around 350 to about 110. Thirdly, the last beat on commercial revenue was largely due to one-time boosts in revenue (For example, they invested into a few SPAC’s previously as they were using foundry, which did quite well) On the government side, growth has been pretty strong (Though not strong enough) and drove almost 100% of the consensus beat. However, management noted that the segment benefited the “favorable” deal timing dynamics, implying potential growth slowdown in future quarters. Furthermore, margins are likely to be depressed in the next few earnings calls: PLTR has announced the release of a new product recently. Analysts noted that this would depress margins in the upcoming report. However, an additional feature was announced 3 weeks ago that likely had significant opex expenses associated that haven’t been priced in considering recent rallies in the stock. Finally, there is increasing competition in the AI analytics space (Think Databricks, Snowflake and even companies like Airtable), making it easier and easier to process and operationalize unstructured data. At the end of the day, there simply aren’t that many use cases for an extremely expensive labor intensive service, which cannot move downmarket no matter how well-loved the service is (As well to organizations with well endowed data science teams). The realization of any of these notes in earnings reports as well as a resolution in any of the geopolitical issues that the US is attached to today could be a turn in investor sentiment and enormous room to the downside. Additionally, macro risks to enterprise spending, intensified by the enormous cost of PLTR’s service create more downside risk. Valuation: Based on a DCF analysis, to justify PLTR’s current pricing, the company needs to expand operating margin 6% by 2029, actually accelerate to a 30% growth rate (from 24%) by 2027 through 2029 as well as maintain a 20x EV/sales multiple (Assumed 14.5% discount rate). However, even in a bull case where we model a 2% beat on consensus revenue annually, and 6% margin expansion by 2029, we still arrive at $35 per share, a 20% drop from current levels. Risk Factors: The biggest risk here is related to the government sector. Specifically the DoD outlines in its 2024 plan a shift to larger-scale implementation and a focus on data and overall modernization of systems. This sounds like the DoD and PLTR are pretty lovey dovey, which could potentially spell higher valuations. Further, the escalation of more dormant issues, like that of China and Taiwan could lead to higher than expected spending and therefore contract signings. Unexpected commercial strength could also occur. Strong enterprise SaaS spending as rates drop could accelerate sales as well as new product launches. For example, Physical AI applications with the new Live Edge platform (focusing on manufacturing use cases) have been added. However, this is unlikely to bring in revenue until later in 2025.

The second is the labor-intensive approach in which the company deploys engineers on-site to negotiate data access, clean that data and build extremely customizable and mission critical infrastructure (Creates high switching costs) To give a brief financial overview, PLTR expects to report 2.8B in net sales, which translates to 2.2B (82.5% Gross Margin) in gross profit, 1B in EBIT (35.4% Operation Margin) and 950M in FCF (34.3% FCF Margin). Most recently PLTR reported revenue of 678.1M (up 27% YoY), beating consensus by 3.8% (563.2M). Guidance was raised 4% for Q3 and 3% for FY2024. This seems aggressive considering that this raise in guidance is larger than the beat just posted. Thus, as expectations grow towards the moon, significant earnings beats will be required for PLTR to continue rising Investment Thesis: Markets are skewing towards exuberance on PLTR, pricing in absolute perfection and unachievable growth for 3 key reasons. First let’s get a lay of the land with valuation multiples. Palantir is trading at an exuberant valuation multiple of 39x sales, surpassing even the largest monopolies and industry players: NVIDIA, probably the hottest stock at the moment, has monopolized over 90% of the GPU market–a necessary prerequisite to our AI revolution, 62% operating margins and revenue growth of 126% in 2024E trades at 35x sales. Databricks, the current leader in data analytics, traded at about 26x sales (And this was during the peak of the SaaS market when Q4 2023 earnings faked out investors). Snowflake, often considered overvalued by investors, trades at around 11x sales. So–Does Palantir have a stronger monopoly than Nvidia, more recurring revenue than Databricks, stickier revenue than Snowflake? The answer is no. Proponents of PLTR often tout individual cases of companies loving their product, but let’s look at it from the top. Net Revenue Retention (NRR) is one of the most popular KPI’s for SaaS companies, essentially saying do customers spend more every year on the product? In other words, have customers loved the product so much that they increase their usage the next year? The answer for PLTR–kind of? Palantir's NRR stands at approximately 110%, down from 115% two years earlier, demonstrating a poor ability to upsell and retain customers. In contrast, Snowflake boasts an NRR of 130% this year and 150% last year when its EV/Sales multiple was at 10x and 20x respectively. This suggests that cheaper competitors not only have higher revenue quality but also more robust growth prospects. Next, let’s look at if the current growth prospects are even justified: Unfortunately, Palantir's commercial customer growth is already slowing. A few notes here: Firstly, The number of new commercial customers added has declined from 57 in Q1 to 39 in Q2. Secondly, Palantir's Bootcamp program, which aims to onboard new customers, has seen participant numbers drop from around 350 to about 110. Thirdly, the last beat on commercial revenue was largely due to one-time boosts in revenue (For example, they invested into a few SPAC’s previously as they were using foundry, which did quite well) On the government side, growth has been pretty strong (Though not strong enough) and drove almost 100% of the consensus beat. However, management noted that the segment benefited the “favorable” deal timing dynamics, implying potential growth slowdown in future quarters. Furthermore, margins are likely to be depressed in the next few earnings calls: PLTR has announced the release of a new product recently. Analysts noted that this would depress margins in the upcoming report. However, an additional feature was announced 3 weeks ago that likely had significant opex expenses associated that haven’t been priced in considering recent rallies in the stock. Finally, there is increasing competition in the AI analytics space (Think Databricks, Snowflake and even companies like Airtable), making it easier and easier to process and operationalize unstructured data. At the end of the day, there simply aren’t that many use cases for an extremely expensive labor intensive service, which cannot move downmarket no matter how well-loved the service is (As well to organizations with well endowed data science teams). The realization of any of these notes in earnings reports as well as a resolution in any of the geopolitical issues that the US is attached to today could be a turn in investor sentiment and enormous room to the downside. Additionally, macro risks to enterprise spending, intensified by the enormous cost of PLTR’s service create more downside risk. Valuation: Based on a DCF analysis, to justify PLTR’s current pricing, the company needs to expand operating margin 6% by 2029, actually accelerate to a 30% growth rate (from 24%) by 2027 through 2029 as well as maintain a 20x EV/sales multiple (Assumed 14.5% discount rate). However, even in a bull case where we model a 2% beat on consensus revenue annually, and 6% margin expansion by 2029, we still arrive at $35 per share, a 20% drop from current levels. Risk Factors: The biggest risk here is related to the government sector. Specifically the DoD outlines in its 2024 plan a shift to larger-scale implementation and a focus on data and overall modernization of systems. This sounds like the DoD and PLTR are pretty lovey dovey, which could potentially spell higher valuations. Further, the escalation of more dormant issues, like that of China and Taiwan could lead to higher than expected spending and therefore contract signings. Unexpected commercial strength could also occur. Strong enterprise SaaS spending as rates drop could accelerate sales as well as new product launches. For example, Physical AI applications with the new Live Edge platform (focusing on manufacturing use cases) have been added. However, this is unlikely to bring in revenue until later in 2025. To hedge against these risks, we could purchase call options, long various paired stocks or set a stop loss.","Here’s a different take on the claims in that short thesis:1. Insider Selling: Insider selling doesn’t always         mean the business is in trouble. There are loads of reasons for it, like personal financial planning, taxes, or just diversifying. For a high-growth stock like PLTR, insider sales are kind of expected, especially given how many of their execs have a huge amount of stock. Selling alone doesn’t mean they’re out of confidence in the company.2. Valuation Multiples: Comparing Palantir to NVIDIA or Snowflake doesn’t really do it justice. Palantir is a totally different beast – it’s not just analytics; it’s deep into the defence and intelligence sectors, with complex, high-security applications that no one else is doing at scale. The high valuation multiple might feel steep, but that’s often the price for a company with such a unique niche and long-term gov contracts.3. Customer Retention and Growth: The 110% NRR isn’t Snowflake-level, but it’s still pretty strong and tells us PLTR clients are sticking around. A lot of these contracts are high-value and come with long sales cycles, especially in defence and government, where the stakes are higher. The onboarding process for PLTR is intensive, so switching to another service isn’t a simple move, and the setup itself locks in clients over the long term.4. Margin Compression from New Products: Yeah, new products cost money upfront, but they’re the future growth engines for PLTR. Look at “Apollo,” for example – it’s designed to lower update costs and boost scalability, so margins should improve over time as more clients adopt it. PLTR has shown that, once established, its products drive long-term gains. So any margin hit now could mean better returns later.5. Competitive Landscape: Snowflake and Databricks are solid, but Palantir’s model is super high-touch and mission-critical, not something you can just swap out easily. It has a solid moat in the government space with top-tier security, which the competition doesn’t match in the same way. And with governments being heavy on data and security needs (think defence, healthcare, etc.), Palantir’s foothold in these sectors gives it an edge the others can’t just step into.6. DCF Analysis: The DCF model is tricky with companies like Palantir, which are more about future potential than what’s already priced in. If their AI platforms keep integrating with more sectors, revenue could grow beyond what the model predicts. Plus, if geopolitical factors ramp up, Palantir’s core products could get more attention and demand.Overall, yeah, there are some fair points on valuation and initial margin pressure. But PLTR’s a long-term play with unique positioning in high-stakes applications. The moat with government contracts and their AI-first approach in the commercial space could drive way more growth than traditional metrics account for.",0,0.539,POSITIVE,0.898,0.539,0.898
,"Had a pitch on PLTR from last Friday. Now that there’s this much insider selling that’s the nail in the coffin. Here’s the pitch for those interested: Recommendation: I recommend a short on Palantir Technologies. The stock is currently priced at $44.79 per share, which I believe will drop by about 20-30% in the next 6–12 months. This is because, the market is highly exuberant in regards to PLTR, pricing in extreme growth rates despite signs of stunting commercial growth. Additionally, overreliance on cyclical government contracts as well as downward pressure on margins due to new AI product launches has led me to believe PLTR is overvalued, which I will prove via this pitch. Company Background: Palantir at its core is a company that focuses on data-analytics, specializing in integrating large amounts of data and operationalizing that data for the public and private sectors. Its speciality lies in the extreme flexibility it provides customers in the form of Forward Deployed Engineers (FDE’s), who can create bespoke AI solutions for any customer. The key platforms are: Gotham, a government intelligence and geospatial platform that is meant to analyze data from various sources to help support military operations and disaster response. Foundry, the commercial segment of the business: This begins with the cleaning and structuring of data, which leads into the integration of this data into AI models (AIP). These models are meant to operationalize company data improving top level decision making. Apollo integrates these systems delivering infrastructure and continual updates. The advantage of this system is two-fold: First is the “ontology”, an effective digital twin of the business, which allows 1. collaboration across departments and 2.

The ability to reason across data and create automations and decision making processes from it (Operationalizing data differentiates PLTR from Snowflake and Databricks which focus on simple storage and basic data analytics). The second is the labor-intensive approach in which the company deploys engineers on-site to negotiate data access, clean that data and build extremely customizable and mission critical infrastructure (Creates high switching costs) To give a brief financial overview, PLTR expects to report 2.8B in net sales, which translates to 2.2B (82.5% Gross Margin) in gross profit, 1B in EBIT (35.4% Operation Margin) and 950M in FCF (34.3% FCF Margin). Most recently PLTR reported revenue of 678.1M (up 27% YoY), beating consensus by 3.8% (563.2M). Guidance was raised 4% for Q3 and 3% for FY2024. This seems aggressive considering that this raise in guidance is larger than the beat just posted. Thus, as expectations grow towards the moon, significant earnings beats will be required for PLTR to continue rising Investment Thesis: Markets are skewing towards exuberance on PLTR, pricing in absolute perfection and unachievable growth for 3 key reasons. First let’s get a lay of the land with valuation multiples. Palantir is trading at an exuberant valuation multiple of 39x sales, surpassing even the largest monopolies and industry players: NVIDIA, probably the hottest stock at the moment, has monopolized over 90% of the GPU market–a necessary prerequisite to our AI revolution, 62% operating margins and revenue growth of 126% in 2024E trades at 35x sales. Databricks, the current leader in data analytics, traded at about 26x sales (And this was during the peak of the SaaS market when Q4 2023 earnings faked out investors). Snowflake, often considered overvalued by investors, trades at around 11x sales. So–Does Palantir have a stronger monopoly than Nvidia, more recurring revenue than Databricks, stickier revenue than Snowflake? The answer is no. Proponents of PLTR often tout individual cases of companies loving their product, but let’s look at it from the top. Net Revenue Retention (NRR) is one of the most popular KPI’s for SaaS companies, essentially saying do customers spend more every year on the product? In other words, have customers loved the product so much that they increase their usage the next year? The answer for PLTR–kind of? Palantir's NRR stands at approximately 110%, down from 115% two years earlier, demonstrating a poor ability to upsell and retain customers. In contrast, Snowflake boasts an NRR of 130% this year and 150% last year when its EV/Sales multiple was at 10x and 20x respectively. This suggests that cheaper competitors not only have higher revenue quality but also more robust growth prospects. Next, let’s look at if the current growth prospects are even justified: Unfortunately, Palantir's commercial customer growth is already slowing. A few notes here: Firstly, The number of new commercial customers added has declined from 57 in Q1 to 39 in Q2. Secondly, Palantir's Bootcamp program, which aims to onboard new customers, has seen participant numbers drop from around 350 to about 110. Thirdly, the last beat on commercial revenue was largely due to one-time boosts in revenue (For example, they invested into a few SPAC’s previously as they were using foundry, which did quite well) On the government side, growth has been pretty strong (Though not strong enough) and drove almost 100% of the consensus beat. However, management noted that the segment benefited the “favorable” deal timing dynamics, implying potential growth slowdown in future quarters. Furthermore, margins are likely to be depressed in the next few earnings calls: PLTR has announced the release of a new product recently. Analysts noted that this would depress margins in the upcoming report. However, an additional feature was announced 3 weeks ago that likely had significant opex expenses associated that haven’t been priced in considering recent rallies in the stock. Finally, there is increasing competition in the AI analytics space (Think Databricks, Snowflake and even companies like Airtable), making it easier and easier to process and operationalize unstructured data. At the end of the day, there simply aren’t that many use cases for an extremely expensive labor intensive service, which cannot move downmarket no matter how well-loved the service is (As well to organizations with well endowed data science teams). The realization of any of these notes in earnings reports as well as a resolution in any of the geopolitical issues that the US is attached to today could be a turn in investor sentiment and enormous room to the downside. Additionally, macro risks to enterprise spending, intensified by the enormous cost of PLTR’s service create more downside risk. Valuation: Based on a DCF analysis, to justify PLTR’s current pricing, the company needs to expand operating margin 6% by 2029, actually accelerate to a 30% growth rate (from 24%) by 2027 through 2029 as well as maintain a 20x EV/sales multiple (Assumed 14.5% discount rate). However, even in a bull case where we model a 2% beat on consensus revenue annually, and 6% margin expansion by 2029, we still arrive at $35 per share, a 20% drop from current levels. Risk Factors: The biggest risk here is related to the government sector. Specifically the DoD outlines in its 2024 plan a shift to larger-scale implementation and a focus on data and overall modernization of systems. This sounds like the DoD and PLTR are pretty lovey dovey, which could potentially spell higher valuations. Further, the escalation of more dormant issues, like that of China and Taiwan could lead to higher than expected spending and therefore contract signings. Unexpected commercial strength could also occur. Strong enterprise SaaS spending as rates drop could accelerate sales as well as new product launches. For example, Physical AI applications with the new Live Edge platform (focusing on manufacturing use cases) have been added. However, this is unlikely to bring in revenue until later in 2025. To hedge against these risks, we could purchase call options, long various paired stocks or set a stop loss.",You’ve heard of paragraph breaks and section titles before right?,0,0.503,NEGATIVE,0.984,0.503,0.984
,"Had a pitch on PLTR from last Friday. Now that there’s this much insider selling that’s the nail in the coffin. Here’s the pitch for those interested: Recommendation: I recommend a short on Palantir Technologies. The stock is currently priced at $44.79 per share, which I believe will drop by about 20-30% in the next 6–12 months. This is because, the market is highly exuberant in regards to PLTR, pricing in extreme growth rates despite signs of stunting commercial growth. Additionally, overreliance on cyclical government contracts as well as downward pressure on margins due to new AI product launches has led me to believe PLTR is overvalued, which I will prove via this pitch. Company Background: Palantir at its core is a company that focuses on data-analytics, specializing in integrating large amounts of data and operationalizing that data for the public and private sectors.

Snowflake, often considered overvalued by investors, trades at around 11x sales. So–Does Palantir have a stronger monopoly than Nvidia, more recurring revenue than Databricks, stickier revenue than Snowflake? The answer is no. Proponents of PLTR often tout individual cases of companies loving their product, but let’s look at it from the top. Net Revenue Retention (NRR) is one of the most popular KPI’s for SaaS companies, essentially saying do customers spend more every year on the product? In other words, have customers loved the product so much that they increase their usage the next year? The answer for PLTR–kind of? Palantir's NRR stands at approximately 110%, down from 115% two years earlier, demonstrating a poor ability to upsell and retain customers. In contrast, Snowflake boasts an NRR of 130% this year and 150% last year when its EV/Sales multiple was at 10x and 20x respectively. This suggests that cheaper competitors not only have higher revenue quality but also more robust growth prospects. Next, let’s look at if the current growth prospects are even justified: Unfortunately, Palantir's commercial customer growth is already slowing. A few notes here: Firstly, The number of new commercial customers added has declined from 57 in Q1 to 39 in Q2. Secondly, Palantir's Bootcamp program, which aims to onboard new customers, has seen participant numbers drop from around 350 to about 110. Thirdly, the last beat on commercial revenue was largely due to one-time boosts in revenue (For example, they invested into a few SPAC’s previously as they were using foundry, which did quite well) On the government side, growth has been pretty strong (Though not strong enough) and drove almost 100% of the consensus beat. However, management noted that the segment benefited the “favorable” deal timing dynamics, implying potential growth slowdown in future quarters. Furthermore, margins are likely to be depressed in the next few earnings calls: PLTR has announced the release of a new product recently. Analysts noted that this would depress margins in the upcoming report. However, an additional feature was announced 3 weeks ago that likely had significant opex expenses associated that haven’t been priced in considering recent rallies in the stock. Finally, there is increasing competition in the AI analytics space (Think Databricks, Snowflake and even companies like Airtable), making it easier and easier to process and operationalize unstructured data. At the end of the day, there simply aren’t that many use cases for an extremely expensive labor intensive service, which cannot move downmarket no matter how well-loved the service is (As well to organizations with well endowed data science teams). The realization of any of these notes in earnings reports as well as a resolution in any of the geopolitical issues that the US is attached to today could be a turn in investor sentiment and enormous room to the downside. Additionally, macro risks to enterprise spending, intensified by the enormous cost of PLTR’s service create more downside risk. Valuation: Based on a DCF analysis, to justify PLTR’s current pricing, the company needs to expand operating margin 6% by 2029, actually accelerate to a 30% growth rate (from 24%) by 2027 through 2029 as well as maintain a 20x EV/sales multiple (Assumed 14.5% discount rate). However, even in a bull case where we model a 2% beat on consensus revenue annually, and 6% margin expansion by 2029, we still arrive at $35 per share, a 20% drop from current levels. Risk Factors: The biggest risk here is related to the government sector. Specifically the DoD outlines in its 2024 plan a shift to larger-scale implementation and a focus on data and overall modernization of systems. This sounds like the DoD and PLTR are pretty lovey dovey, which could potentially spell higher valuations. Further, the escalation of more dormant issues, like that of China and Taiwan could lead to higher than expected spending and therefore contract signings. Unexpected commercial strength could also occur. Strong enterprise SaaS spending as rates drop could accelerate sales as well as new product launches. For example, Physical AI applications with the new Live Edge platform (focusing on manufacturing use cases) have been added. However, this is unlikely to bring in revenue until later in 2025. To hedge against these risks, we could purchase call options, long various paired stocks or set a stop loss.","Bagholder spotted.I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

,"Had a pitch on PLTR from last Friday. Now that there’s this much insider selling that’s the nail in the coffin. Here’s the pitch for those interested: Recommendation: I recommend a short on Palantir Technologies. The stock is currently priced at $44.79 per share, which I believe will drop by about 20-30% in the next 6–12 months. This is because, the market is highly exuberant in regards to PLTR, pricing in extreme growth rates despite signs of stunting commercial growth. Additionally, overreliance on cyclical government contracts as well as downward pressure on margins due to new AI product launches has led me to believe PLTR is overvalued, which I will prove via this pitch. Company Background: Palantir at its core is a company that focuses on data-analytics, specializing in integrating large amounts of data and operationalizing that data for the public and private sectors. Its speciality lies in the extreme flexibility it provides customers in the form of Forward Deployed Engineers (FDE’s), who can create bespoke AI solutions for any customer. The key platforms are: Gotham, a government intelligence and geospatial platform that is meant to analyze data from various sources to help support military operations and disaster response. Foundry, the commercial segment of the business: This begins with the cleaning and structuring of data, which leads into the integration of this data into AI models (AIP). These models are meant to operationalize company data improving top level decision making. Apollo integrates these systems delivering infrastructure and continual updates. The advantage of this system is two-fold: First is the “ontology”, an effective digital twin of the business, which allows 1. collaboration across departments and 2. The ability to reason across data and create automations and decision making processes from it (Operationalizing data differentiates PLTR from Snowflake and Databricks which focus on simple storage and basic data analytics). The second is the labor-intensive approach in which the company deploys engineers on-site to negotiate data access, clean that data and build extremely customizable and mission critical infrastructure (Creates high switching costs) To give a brief financial overview, PLTR expects to report 2.8B in net sales, which translates to 2.2B (82.5% Gross Margin) in gross profit, 1B in EBIT (35.4% Operation Margin) and 950M in FCF (34.3% FCF Margin). Most recently PLTR reported revenue of 678.1M (up 27% YoY), beating consensus by 3.8% (563.2M). Guidance was raised 4% for Q3 and 3% for FY2024. This seems aggressive considering that this raise in guidance is larger than the beat just posted. Thus, as expectations grow towards the moon, significant earnings beats will be required for PLTR to continue rising Investment Thesis: Markets are skewing towards exuberance on PLTR, pricing in absolute perfection and unachievable growth for 3 key reasons.

Furthermore, margins are likely to be depressed in the next few earnings calls: PLTR has announced the release of a new product recently. Analysts noted that this would depress margins in the upcoming report. However, an additional feature was announced 3 weeks ago that likely had significant opex expenses associated that haven’t been priced in considering recent rallies in the stock. Finally, there is increasing competition in the AI analytics space (Think Databricks, Snowflake and even companies like Airtable), making it easier and easier to process and operationalize unstructured data. At the end of the day, there simply aren’t that many use cases for an extremely expensive labor intensive service, which cannot move downmarket no matter how well-loved the service is (As well to organizations with well endowed data science teams). The realization of any of these notes in earnings reports as well as a resolution in any of the geopolitical issues that the US is attached to today could be a turn in investor sentiment and enormous room to the downside. Additionally, macro risks to enterprise spending, intensified by the enormous cost of PLTR’s service create more downside risk. Valuation: Based on a DCF analysis, to justify PLTR’s current pricing, the company needs to expand operating margin 6% by 2029, actually accelerate to a 30% growth rate (from 24%) by 2027 through 2029 as well as maintain a 20x EV/sales multiple (Assumed 14.5% discount rate). However, even in a bull case where we model a 2% beat on consensus revenue annually, and 6% margin expansion by 2029, we still arrive at $35 per share, a 20% drop from current levels. Risk Factors: The biggest risk here is related to the government sector. Specifically the DoD outlines in its 2024 plan a shift to larger-scale implementation and a focus on data and overall modernization of systems. This sounds like the DoD and PLTR are pretty lovey dovey, which could potentially spell higher valuations. Further, the escalation of more dormant issues, like that of China and Taiwan could lead to higher than expected spending and therefore contract signings. Unexpected commercial strength could also occur. Strong enterprise SaaS spending as rates drop could accelerate sales as well as new product launches. For example, Physical AI applications with the new Live Edge platform (focusing on manufacturing use cases) have been added. However, this is unlikely to bring in revenue until later in 2025. To hedge against these risks, we could purchase call options, long various paired stocks or set a stop loss.",Thiel supplying that money to his buddy Vance,0,0.506,POSITIVE,0.803,0.506,0.803
,"Had a pitch on PLTR from last Friday. Now that there’s this much insider selling that’s the nail in the coffin. Here’s the pitch for those interested: Recommendation: I recommend a short on Palantir Technologies. The stock is currently priced at $44.79 per share, which I believe will drop by about 20-30% in the next 6–12 months. This is because, the market is highly exuberant in regards to PLTR, pricing in extreme growth rates despite signs of stunting commercial growth. Additionally, overreliance on cyclical government contracts as well as downward pressure on margins due to new AI product launches has led me to believe PLTR is overvalued, which I will prove via this pitch. Company Background: Palantir at its core is a company that focuses on data-analytics, specializing in integrating large amounts of data and operationalizing that data for the public and private sectors. Its speciality lies in the extreme flexibility it provides customers in the form of Forward Deployed Engineers (FDE’s), who can create bespoke AI solutions for any customer. The key platforms are: Gotham, a government intelligence and geospatial platform that is meant to analyze data from various sources to help support military operations and disaster response. Foundry, the commercial segment of the business: This begins with the cleaning and structuring of data, which leads into the integration of this data into AI models (AIP). These models are meant to operationalize company data improving top level decision making. Apollo integrates these systems delivering infrastructure and continual updates. The advantage of this system is two-fold: First is the “ontology”, an effective digital twin of the business, which allows 1. collaboration across departments and 2. The ability to reason across data and create automations and decision making processes from it (Operationalizing data differentiates PLTR from Snowflake and Databricks which focus on simple storage and basic data analytics). The second is the labor-intensive approach in which the company deploys engineers on-site to negotiate data access, clean that data and build extremely customizable and mission critical infrastructure (Creates high switching costs) To give a brief financial overview, PLTR expects to report 2.8B in net sales, which translates to 2.2B (82.5% Gross Margin) in gross profit, 1B in EBIT (35.4% Operation Margin) and 950M in FCF (34.3% FCF Margin). Most recently PLTR reported revenue of 678.1M (up 27% YoY), beating consensus by 3.8% (563.2M). Guidance was raised 4% for Q3 and 3% for FY2024. This seems aggressive considering that this raise in guidance is larger than the beat just posted. Thus, as expectations grow towards the moon, significant earnings beats will be required for PLTR to continue rising Investment Thesis: Markets are skewing towards exuberance on PLTR, pricing in absolute perfection and unachievable growth for 3 key reasons. First let’s get a lay of the land with valuation multiples. Palantir is trading at an exuberant valuation multiple of 39x sales, surpassing even the largest monopolies and industry players: NVIDIA, probably the hottest stock at the moment, has monopolized over 90% of the GPU market–a necessary prerequisite to our AI revolution, 62% operating margins and revenue growth of 126% in 2024E trades at 35x sales. Databricks, the current leader in data analytics, traded at about 26x sales (And this was during the peak of the SaaS market when Q4 2023 earnings faked out investors). Snowflake, often considered overvalued by investors, trades at around 11x sales. So–Does Palantir have a stronger monopoly than Nvidia, more recurring revenue than Databricks, stickier revenue than Snowflake? The answer is no. Proponents of PLTR often tout individual cases of companies loving their product, but let’s look at it from the top. Net Revenue Retention (NRR) is one of the most popular KPI’s for SaaS companies, essentially saying do customers spend more every year on the product? In other words, have customers loved the product so much that they increase their usage the next year? The answer for PLTR–kind of? Palantir's NRR stands at approximately 110%, down from 115% two years earlier, demonstrating a poor ability to upsell and retain customers. In contrast, Snowflake boasts an NRR of 130% this year and 150% last year when its EV/Sales multiple was at 10x and 20x respectively. This suggests that cheaper competitors not only have higher revenue quality but also more robust growth prospects. Next, let’s look at if the current growth prospects are even justified: Unfortunately, Palantir's commercial customer growth is already slowing. A few notes here: Firstly, The number of new commercial customers added has declined from 57 in Q1 to 39 in Q2. Secondly, Palantir's Bootcamp program, which aims to onboard new customers, has seen participant numbers drop from around 350 to about 110. Thirdly, the last beat on commercial revenue was largely due to one-time boosts in revenue (For example, they invested into a few SPAC’s previously as they were using foundry, which did quite well) On the government side, growth has been pretty strong (Though not strong enough) and drove almost 100% of the consensus beat.

,"Had a pitch on PLTR from last Friday. Now that there’s this much insider selling that’s the nail in the coffin. Here’s the pitch for those interested: Recommendation: I recommend a short on Palantir Technologies. The stock is currently priced at $44.79 per share, which I believe will drop by about 20-30% in the next 6–12 months. This is because, the market is highly exuberant in regards to PLTR, pricing in extreme growth rates despite signs of stunting commercial growth. Additionally, overreliance on cyclical government contracts as well as downward pressure on margins due to new AI product launches has led me to believe PLTR is overvalued, which I will prove via this pitch. Company Background: Palantir at its core is a company that focuses on data-analytics, specializing in integrating large amounts of data and operationalizing that data for the public and private sectors. Its speciality lies in the extreme flexibility it provides customers in the form of Forward Deployed Engineers (FDE’s), who can create bespoke AI solutions for any customer. The key platforms are: Gotham, a government intelligence and geospatial platform that is meant to analyze data from various sources to help support military operations and disaster response. Foundry, the commercial segment of the business: This begins with the cleaning and structuring of data, which leads into the integration of this data into AI models (AIP). These models are meant to operationalize company data improving top level decision making. Apollo integrates these systems delivering infrastructure and continual updates. The advantage of this system is two-fold: First is the “ontology”, an effective digital twin of the business, which allows 1. collaboration across departments and 2. The ability to reason across data and create automations and decision making processes from it (Operationalizing data differentiates PLTR from Snowflake and Databricks which focus on simple storage and basic data analytics). The second is the labor-intensive approach in which the company deploys engineers on-site to negotiate data access, clean that data and build extremely customizable and mission critical infrastructure (Creates high switching costs) To give a brief financial overview, PLTR expects to report 2.8B in net sales, which translates to 2.2B (82.5% Gross Margin) in gross profit, 1B in EBIT (35.4% Operation Margin) and 950M in FCF (34.3% FCF Margin). Most recently PLTR reported revenue of 678.1M (up 27% YoY), beating consensus by 3.8% (563.2M). Guidance was raised 4% for Q3 and 3% for FY2024. This seems aggressive considering that this raise in guidance is larger than the beat just posted. Thus, as expectations grow towards the moon, significant earnings beats will be required for PLTR to continue rising Investment Thesis: Markets are skewing towards exuberance on PLTR, pricing in absolute perfection and unachievable growth for 3 key reasons. First let’s get a lay of the land with valuation multiples. Palantir is trading at an exuberant valuation multiple of 39x sales, surpassing even the largest monopolies and industry players: NVIDIA, probably the hottest stock at the moment, has monopolized over 90% of the GPU market–a necessary prerequisite to our AI revolution, 62% operating margins and revenue growth of 126% in 2024E trades at 35x sales. Databricks, the current leader in data analytics, traded at about 26x sales (And this was during the peak of the SaaS market when Q4 2023 earnings faked out investors). Snowflake, often considered overvalued by investors, trades at around 11x sales. So–Does Palantir have a stronger monopoly than Nvidia, more recurring revenue than Databricks, stickier revenue than Snowflake? The answer is no. Proponents of PLTR often tout individual cases of companies loving their product, but let’s look at it from the top. Net Revenue Retention (NRR) is one of the most popular KPI’s for SaaS companies, essentially saying do customers spend more every year on the product? In other words, have customers loved the product so much that they increase their usage the next year? The answer for PLTR–kind of? Palantir's NRR stands at approximately 110%, down from 115% two years earlier, demonstrating a poor ability to upsell and retain customers. In contrast, Snowflake boasts an NRR of 130% this year and 150% last year when its EV/Sales multiple was at 10x and 20x respectively. This suggests that cheaper competitors not only have higher revenue quality but also more robust growth prospects. Next, let’s look at if the current growth prospects are even justified: Unfortunately, Palantir's commercial customer growth is already slowing. A few notes here: Firstly, The number of new commercial customers added has declined from 57 in Q1 to 39 in Q2. Secondly, Palantir's Bootcamp program, which aims to onboard new customers, has seen participant numbers drop from around 350 to about 110. Thirdly, the last beat on commercial revenue was largely due to one-time boosts in revenue (For example, they invested into a few SPAC’s previously as they were using foundry, which did quite well) On the government side, growth has been pretty strong (Though not strong enough) and drove almost 100% of the consensus beat. However, management noted that the segment benefited the “favorable” deal timing dynamics, implying potential growth slowdown in future quarters. Furthermore, margins are likely to be depressed in the next few earnings calls: PLTR has announced the release of a new product recently. Analysts noted that this would depress margins in the upcoming report. However, an additional feature was announced 3 weeks ago that likely had significant opex expenses associated that haven’t been priced in considering recent rallies in the stock. Finally, there is increasing competition in the AI analytics space (Think Databricks, Snowflake and even companies like Airtable), making it easier and easier to process and operationalize unstructured data. At the end of the day, there simply aren’t that many use cases for an extremely expensive labor intensive service, which cannot move downmarket no matter how well-loved the service is (As well to organizations with well endowed data science teams). The realization of any of these notes in earnings reports as well as a resolution in any of the geopolitical issues that the US is attached to today could be a turn in investor sentiment and enormous room to the downside. Additionally, macro risks to enterprise spending, intensified by the enormous cost of PLTR’s service create more downside risk. Valuation: Based on a DCF analysis, to justify PLTR’s current pricing, the company needs to expand operating margin 6% by 2029, actually accelerate to a 30% growth rate (from 24%) by 2027 through 2029 as well as maintain a 20x EV/sales multiple (Assumed 14.5% discount rate). However, even in a bull case where we model a 2% beat on consensus revenue annually, and 6% margin expansion by 2029, we still arrive at $35 per share, a 20% drop from current levels. Risk Factors: The biggest risk here is related to the government sector. Specifically the DoD outlines in its 2024 plan a shift to larger-scale implementation and a focus on data and overall modernization of systems. This sounds like the DoD and PLTR are pretty lovey dovey, which could potentially spell higher valuations. Further, the escalation of more dormant issues, like that of China and Taiwan could lead to higher than expected spending and therefore contract signings. Unexpected commercial strength could also occur. Strong enterprise SaaS spending as rates drop could accelerate sales as well as new product launches. For example, Physical AI applications with the new Live Edge platform (focusing on manufacturing use cases) have been added. However, this is unlikely to bring in revenue until later in 2025. To hedge against these risks, we could purchase call options, long various paired stocks or set a stop loss.",Im about to short your writing style bro do you not believe in paragraphs?!,0,0.499,NEGATIVE,1.0,0.499,1.0
