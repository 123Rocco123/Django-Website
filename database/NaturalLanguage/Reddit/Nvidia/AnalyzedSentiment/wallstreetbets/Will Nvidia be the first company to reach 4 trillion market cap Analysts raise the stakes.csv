,,"So if profits went up by ~35% YTY but they did a 10:1 split and went up by 28.9% in stock price YTY, then isn't it overvalued? That's a 300% increase in evaluation with a 35% increase in profit. Granted, there is a lot of hype around them bc of AI monopoly and people doing AI start ups and research, but is it worth that much? Genuinely I'm not sure.",0,0.583,NEGATIVE,0.999,0.583,0.999

,,Genuine question.This is a bubble based entirely on speculation right ?Like as far as I'm aware. Nvidia's main income is designing and selling GPU's. It doesn't even own the machines to make them ?,0,0.544,NEGATIVE,1.0,0.544,1.0
,,"The GPU is what is in demand so doesn't matter they they don't make the ""machines"". They actually do make some but it's not that much in the grand picture.Bubble, who knows. Eventually the AI build out will slow and if all they do is focus on GPUs then price will have to come down. But demand is still crazy well into 2026",1,0.533,NEGATIVE,0.999,0.533,0.999
,,Well I'm saying they don't own the lithography machines and factories that make the GPU's right ?They only do designs as far as I'm aware.,2,0.582,NEGATIVE,0.652,0.582,0.652
,,"Correct, most chip companies outsource production to TSMC and ASML supplies lithography to TSMC. There are risks to making your own chips. Look at Intel, they design and make their own chips and are having a hard time. Lots of capacity to produce chips for others but no one trusts giving their intellectual property to Intel because they could copy it for their own chips. TSMC does not have their own chips so are trusted to make chips for others",3,0.527,POSITIVE,0.985,0.527,0.985
