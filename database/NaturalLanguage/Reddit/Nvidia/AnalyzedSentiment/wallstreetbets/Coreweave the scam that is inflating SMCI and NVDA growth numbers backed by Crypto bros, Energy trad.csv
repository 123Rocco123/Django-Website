Any startup in the Ai space that relies on Nvidia chips needs a tonne of money for the Capex. They are a big hyperscaler and a GPU cloud provider. Yes, NVidia invested in them. Also, Nvidia and many others use them for their GPU cloud. This is not round tripping. In fact, this is great news for a startup that their services are being used by investing companies.  Such dogfooding is not uncommon. Even OpenAi has investments by Microsoft and others, and their services and IP are being used by Microsoft. They are growing really fast given the need of GPU services. They scaled from 3 data centers to 10 this year. Also, just a cursory glance into numbers will be enough to debunk the conspiracy theory in the posting. Nvidia's net investment in coreweave is just 100 million - typical rounds nvidia makes for promising startups.
