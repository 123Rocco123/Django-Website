,"Some very bullish news last night for ACN (Accenture), who ink a consulting deal with NVDA. I think that this will make ACN more exposed to NVDA's AI fuelled bullishness and I think as a swing trade will send it back to 52 week highs or even ATHs in the 400s. HEre's my full thoughts. So after hours, lost in the NVDA bullishness following Jensen's comments, we got the following news: “Accenture and Nvidia expanded their partnership to establish an Nvidia business group aimed at helping clients adopt and scale generative AI tools.” What does this mean? Well it means that when clients are coming to NVDA to buy their chips, and they need help with understanding how to use it and how tailor the Ai capabilities to be most productive for their company, the person they will come to is Accenture. THink about this. That means that the more clients are coming to NVDA to buy their chips and harness their AI capabilities, the more people will be coming to Accenture. This is why I say they can essentially become an NVDA sympathy trade due to this tie up, which can help to give it the tailwind to move to new highs. I mean let's look at what Jensen was saying yesterday on Blackwell chips demand. He said the demand was INSANE. So a LOT of companies are coming to NVDA trying to get in on the chips. And with this deal, a bunch of them will also be going to Accenture now to udnerstand how to use that power for their business. So it is very very pwoerful news for the company. Up only 1.3% in premarket, I believe this news has gone udner the radar a little bit. From a techncial spot we see we are above a key resistance, but we will be coming into resistance with the trendline and potentially again at 387. A break of these would likely move us to ATH, but we will probably face resistance here. However, This for me would be a SWING trade for medium term. Whilst clearly different in most ways, the way it is an NVDA sympathy trade reminds me a lot of NOW, which has NVDA fuel because NVDA chips run on Servicenow. As such, whilst these technical resistances are useful for mid term traders, I dont think so for those with my intent who will try to ride the tailwinds of NVDA growth. We should hopefully see more correlation between the 2. IF the market properly picks up on this news. Positioning overall bullish to 380.",GPT-REEEE,0,,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999
