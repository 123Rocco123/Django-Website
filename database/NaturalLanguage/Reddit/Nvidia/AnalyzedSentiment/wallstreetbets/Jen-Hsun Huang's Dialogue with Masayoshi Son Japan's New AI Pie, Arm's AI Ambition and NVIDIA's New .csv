,"On 13 November, Jen-Hsun Huang and Masayoshi Son had an offline conversation in Japan, with a relaxed atmosphere, reviewing the latter's past investment in NVIDIA and discussing the development of AI in Japan. This article provides a summary of the past entanglements between the two, as well as the direction of the current stage of development. At the 2020 Softbank World Congress, Masayoshi Son and Jen-Hsun Huang had a round-the-counter conversation on ‘What's Next for AI’. Jen-Hsun Huang, sitting by the fire in his trademark leather jacket, talked about the value of bringing Arm into the fold, and Masayoshi didn't mince his words, saying that the elder Huang would reach the level of Steve Jobs in the next 10 years. Four years later, the 61-year-old Jen-Hsun Huang and the 67-year-old Masayoshi Son sat down together again, and the topic still revolves around AI, but their personal situation and their helms of Nvidia and SoftBank have changed. 4 years of vicissitudes, Nvidia's plan to buy Arm at a huge cost has been aborted, but it has become one of the highest flyers on the wind of AI. On the contrary, Masayoshi Son, after putting his main efforts into Arm, experienced a trough, and finally ushered in a reversal in 2023 with the east wind of AI, and the success of Arm's IPO greatly alleviated the pressure on Softbank's revenue. On a different path, whether it's Jen-Hsun Huang or ambitious Masayoshi Son, they are all betting on AI, Nvidia is known as the ‘arms dealer in the AI era’, and all of them, from big companies to unicorns, rely on their high-performance GPUs to guarantee their arithmetic power; Arm announced in July this year that it has formally entered into the field of AI chips, and it plans to realise mass production in the autumn of next year. So it was no surprise that AI was the theme of the dialogue, which began with a ‘brag’ from Jen-Hsun Huang, who praised Masayoshi Son as ‘the only entrepreneur and innovator in the world who chooses and partners with the winners in every generation of technological change’. They then focused on AI development in Japan.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999,0.5,0.999
