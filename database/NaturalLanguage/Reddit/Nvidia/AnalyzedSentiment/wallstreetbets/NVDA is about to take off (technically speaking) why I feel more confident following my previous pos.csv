,"Greetings, I hope everyone is getting ready to talk stocks and politics at the Thanksgiving table because that's what the holiday is all about, amiright? I for one will be talking about NVDA. I posted earlier today around 10am-11am EST and said that NVDA was gonna stop sliding at 131-ish, since there is a good support there. And what happened???? The turkey came home to roast Yes, that's right - it snapped back like a rubber band into your eye. Ok, so that means that the support level that I suggested held for a 3rd time, making it very reliable. And to add some sugar to that sweet potato pie, the stock closed up $3 from the low and a bullish pattern formed throughout the whole day - the cup and handle (""C+H""). If you don't know what the C+H pattern looks like, go to your mom's breakfront where she keeps all the tchotchkes and the fine china and take out a tea cup. Hold it up and look at it from the side, with the cup's handle on the right side. Then look at the screenshots I uploaded. It's the same thing. This mean stock go up. Interesting how NVDA held at that support level and then the entire day formed a C+H pattern... Hmmm... Smells bullish, that's the vibe. Positions: Still the 500 shares of NVDA @ $142.25 Added 100 11/29 calls @ 140",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

But I will buy the stock and will prolly hold for at least 1 year. I would not be surprised if it would go below 100 not bcs of some drawing but bcs I believe this to be a fair market value based on current earnings. Currently future earnings are basically priced in and I do believe them to increase but people seem to feel bearish about the stock maybe bcs there are other stocks or being scared of tarifs.
