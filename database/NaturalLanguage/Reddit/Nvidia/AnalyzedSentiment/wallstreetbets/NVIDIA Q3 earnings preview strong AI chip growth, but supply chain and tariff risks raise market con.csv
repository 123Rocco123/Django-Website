,"Nvidia is set to report its Q3 earnings after the close of trading today, an earnings report that will be crucial for investors to understand the latest developments in the AI industry.Nvidia, the world's largest publicly traded company by market capitalisation, has benefited from the AI tech According to the current speculation, Nvidia's third-quarter revenue (EPS) is expected to be $0.74 for $33.2 billion, up 83% year-over-year, respectively. Of this, revenue from the data centre division is expected to reach $29 billion, an increase of 100% from the same period last year. Gaming Revenue Investors are not only focusing on the financial performance of the third quarter, but also on whether Nvidia will adjust its earnings estimates for the fourth quarter. Analysts are still predicting $37 billion for the fourth quarter. However, even if the earnings report exceeds expectations, Nvidia's stock will still hit $37 billion. The possible decline could be partly due to the market its earnings expectations have trended higher, or investors Also, Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell AI chips are expected to generate billions of dollars in revenue for the company, but shipments of the series have been delayed, mainly due to overheating issues affecting servers, which may be its installations in data centres. , the current government department may impose tariffs on global products, especially on chips made in Taiwan, giving Nvidia levy uncertainty. Since most of Nvidia's chips are made by Taiwan's TSMC, the tariffs could raise the price of AI chips, which could affect its profit margins or pass the cost on to customers. These signs could lead to a less-than-expected market reaction. It could create uncertainty for Nvidia's future.
