,nan,"Bitcoin per share increases each buy, that's the difference. In 2 years your bitcoin per share could triple and the rest is gains.Like a bitcoin dividend... Could MSTR keep up adding Bitcoin per share and giving a bitcoin yield? Not for ever but probably for a long time, enough to overperform bitcoin even if nav reverts, that the bet.In other worlds your first buy it's x3 the price of Bitcoin for the sats backing the shares. But after your first buy each time microstrategy buys bitcoin, new holders get a 33%.and shareholders get the other 66%. Even if buys stop you still have the original sats backing the shares and some more.I'm a bull cause i think even if nav reverts to 1 someday, i think bitcoin adoption and growth allows for the bitcoin yield to more than triple my sats per share by the time hyperbitcoinization happens.

,nan,"Bitcoin ETFs don’t directly buy Bitcoin; they use leverage to mimic Bitcoin’s price action.That's false. IBIT, ARKB are two that come to mind that actually hold bitcoin.",0,0.525,NEGATIVE,0.999
,nan,Coinbase holds their BTC. Only FBTC custodies their own,1,0.503,POSITIVE,0.992
,nan,Which makes the point even more valid - more of them = less flow into MSTR. 1 MSTR cannot be worth more then BTC if ETFS continue,1,0.517,POSITIVE,0.995

,nan,"I will let the market decide on this one. As far as I know, Saylor is selling Vol. $BTC is just the instrument. He said Blackrock cannot replicate this as they have a fiduciary duty makes them less volatile.",0,0.56,NEGATIVE,0.999

,nan,"The largest BTC etf right now is Blackrock. It's not fake leveraged, btc. Blackrock buys the btc when the holder puts in an order.Blackrock owns 5.2% of MSTR stocks. They are not the only BTC ETF that owns MSTR stock.Do you think that these guys know something that you don't?",0,0.536,POSITIVE,0.74
,nan,Which makes my point even more valid = less inflow to MSTR . Since it’s already more expensive then a BTC .,1,0.506,POSITIVE,1.0
,nan,How does it make your point? The Bitcoin etf companies are heavily invested in MSTR. If they were worried about their inflows devaluing MSTR why would they have so much money in it?,2,0.517,NEGATIVE,1.0
