,,"The dotcom boom was headed by a bunch of completely irrational companies that made no money, but had ""promise"". Cisco sold the foundation to those crappy companies (yet itself was a viable company). Things collapsed as they did. The AI thing is headed by the most profitable powerful players on the planet. If they do not know how to make money from this, no one ever will. NVIDA is with them, not pets.com. Not that the AI thing will not fizzle, just that it will not be taken down by a bunch of useless zombie website companies that are valued in completely irrational ways.

,,so it's still profitable. a lot of companies especially that size generate revenue from internal billings. But I get your point and can't dispute it. Instead of revenue generated perhaps for this example I'd be better off pointing out the revenues gained from efficiency from AI?I mean health care AI is expected to have an incredible impact.
