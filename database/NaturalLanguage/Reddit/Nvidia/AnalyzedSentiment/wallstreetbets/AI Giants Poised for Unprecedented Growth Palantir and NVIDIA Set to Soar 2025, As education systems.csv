Half of the failure was getting them to that computer in the first place, and the other half was having them pay attention to the shit on there without popping open another tab.More to the point, most of the value in schools today is having them serve as a public daycare, so that neoliberals can enlist both parents into the workforce. Anything the kids learn while being babysat is secondary. If American businesses need educated workers, they can import them.Teachers are already in charge of babysitting 30-40 kids per classroom... do we think that buying chatbots will allow districts to fire teachers and spread that number thinner?",0,0.513,NEGATIVE,0.999,0.513,0.999
