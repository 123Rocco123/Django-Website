,"The rally in shares of chipmaker Broadcom after last week’s earnings is reminiscent of when Nvidia’s stock started to take off in 2023. Broadcom now needs to prove it can follow through to become another giant of the AI era. Broadcom shares have soared 38% since it reported, pushing its market value to almost $1.2 trillion.

Nvidia, though, has set a bullish precedent for investors wanting to jump onto the next big potential AI winner.
