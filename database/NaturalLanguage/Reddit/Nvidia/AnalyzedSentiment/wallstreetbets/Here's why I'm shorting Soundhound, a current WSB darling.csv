,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.",this is an excellent example of DD. one of the best i've seen all year.,0,0.611,POSITIVE,0.999

The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.",A true degen,1,0.508,NEGATIVE,0.997
,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline.

Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.",I fuckin choked when I read this lolz,2,0.501,NEGATIVE,0.944
,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue.

Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.",I like that he put little pictures.

,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI.

,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.",Even chucking this into gpt to summarise is too fucking long.,1,0.522,NEGATIVE,1.0

Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.",Less intelligent than a roomba.

,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results.

But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.","Thanks for reading.

,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.

This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.","You know when I started seeing SOUN trending on WSB — I took a look at their website and thought wtf is the boomer shit, and how is it worth 5bil lol.

,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development.

But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.","It's really incredible how shitty it is, shouldn't expect much less from a 2021 SPAC",1,0.504,NEGATIVE,0.989
,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts.

Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.","This was literally my thought as well, wouldn’t put it past this management team to start desperation buying btc",1,0.518,POSITIVE,0.816
,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement.

Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.",Yeah what this guy said,1,0.755,POSITIVE,0.993
,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business.

Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.",I just kept scrolling and I was like ok op I wont buy it what the hell,1,0.524,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.

Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.",I lost $5k on SOUN this morning lol,0,0.501,NEGATIVE,0.599
,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story.

Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.",I’ve never shorted a stock beforeFuck it. -$10000 I go,0,0.569,NEGATIVE,0.984
,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news?

But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.","Congratulations OP, or, I'm really sorry that happened to you.

,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting.

Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.",Dumb bull brain like pretty pictures,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999
,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact.

This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.","I was familiar with Amilia because I work close to this industry, so when they announced the deal and claimed 89% growth I was very skeptical.

,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound.

But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.",They probably wanted to get into enterprise customer accounts like the credit union I mentioned.

Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.","Lol thanks for reading it, regards",1,0.506,POSITIVE,0.987
,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year.

Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.",You sound smart.

,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M.

Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.","I'm shorting all of this trash, SoundHound , palantir, that's just the top of the icebergwhat world do we live in that these companies that lose money are trading at 100x multipleshas the whole world gone crazy???

,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI.

,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer.

Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.","Great DD and awesome insights! One cliffhanger I'm curious about, and it might be pure speculation, but why would SoundHound spend the $200+ million to buy Amelia given its declining model? One would assume that it was for more than an obscenely expensive accounting gimmick that would last, at best, a year. Is there no sign of a belief that integrating into Amelia with some of their own technology might revive the brand and expand the customer base rather than shrink it?Asking for a friend.",0,0.558,POSITIVE,0.92
,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).

This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.","I tried to read this whole thing 3 times, gave up, and decided to inverse you.

,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is.

Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.",This has to be AI right?,1,0.64,NEGATIVE,0.989
,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.

Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.","Someone typing bussin, fam, and fr fr would not make a Hindenburg reference.

,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia.

Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.",So…. Buy calls?,0,0.573,NEGATIVE,0.994
,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news?

But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.","Great DD, really enjoyed the read.

,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting.

The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.","Thank you!The company and management continue to flood the market with new shares. They are constantly issuing new equity, and the Amelia shareholders have been waiting since 1998 for their payday - they will sell their SOUN shares when they can. This will put pressure on the stock over timeI think they have 1 year before it’s impossible to hide the decline in the business. Amelia is going to be such a complex business to integrate and make something modern out of. SOUN’s attention won’t be focused, and their business is already declining.LEAPS",1,0.587,NEGATIVE,0.944
,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this.

Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.",Bought $5000 of April $10 puts,0,0.513,NEGATIVE,0.542
,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI.

,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.",OP is going to hate McDonalds.

Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.","I agree. Right after I read OP's post I went to the Visionworks website, which is a pretty big company, and used their chat, which is powered by Amelia. It was able to answer all of my questions and pull up my appointment info for me. Made me a satisfied customer, because i didnt have to talk to a person or wait on the phone or any of that stuff. But, I like Soundhound so maybe I'm biased",1,0.543,POSITIVE,0.994
,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).

And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.","I thought it was overpriced at 6, was waiting for it to go back to 2.I look away for a few weeks and somehow it went from 6 to 15.",0,0.508,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”.

But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.",Massive Christian Bale big short vibes,1,0.507,NEGATIVE,0.999
,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers.

The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.",The funniest thing would be tomorrow NVDA announced something involving SOUN and u get gaped,0,0.509,POSITIVE,0.96
,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price.

SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.",Me but with $5 puts on the same day.

,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you.

Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.",something something this is not financial advice,1,0.526,NEGATIVE,0.951
,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens.

The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.",LEAPS,1,0.5,POSITIVE,0.999
,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue.

Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.","Nice try, SOUN will do really well in the future.

,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly?

But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.",Massive volume.

Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.",Inverse WSB calls it is.,0,0.508,POSITIVE,0.997
,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).

None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.",You have massive titanium balls for shorting a company with AI in its name,0,0.644,POSITIVE,0.937
,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would.

Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.",lol I’m still gonna hold,0,0.509,POSITIVE,0.994
,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance.

Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer.

,"Alright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares Tl;dr: At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever. Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record. Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle ______________________________________________________________________________ Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that all of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, Soundhound’s business declined ~9%. Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins.

Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired is also declining). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get ~$44.7M.  Amelia Revenue We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but Amelia is actually not a SaaS business, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be ~$22M (50% * $44.7M).  Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize ~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, $13M (58% * $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.  Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that the organic Soundhound business generated just ~$12M, declining ~9% year-over-year. Soundhound Q3 Growth Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, revenue for both Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!  Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue will decline by a staggering 27% YoY. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting. Soundhound Q4 guidance When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - 95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.  Soundhound revenue by type This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company.  Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack.  Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their website, click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went:  Amelia Chat Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.  Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai website and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went:  Sierra chat The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others.  None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years.  But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations? That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you.  None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also ~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger: In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of ~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!  Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because they don’t sell very much software, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings:  Amelia revenue by type The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report, so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”.  Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%.  Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers.  Adding to the problem is customer concentration: 62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater. Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers. The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance. Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a private $75M venture round, long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s 2021 de-SPAC process, yet retail investors and media only took notice when Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day. Prior to this, the one and only time NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them: Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a press release about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023 based on a trip to the Wayback machine NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023 But let’s examine the facts. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, including Soundhound’s closest competitor (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a blog post showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly? NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current (Cerence) The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story. This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype. Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher) In its press release announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…” While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal.  The details can be found in the stock purchase agreement, but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices) This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts. Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself).  We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August.  With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x. For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x. But at least with Palantir, you’re getting a differentiated business, with competitive moats and deep ties to the incoming administration that happens to be Palantir’s biggest customer. With Soundhound, you’re getting boomer-tech that’s trying to go head to head with some the best funded, most talented competitors on the planet.",🥱,1,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.761
