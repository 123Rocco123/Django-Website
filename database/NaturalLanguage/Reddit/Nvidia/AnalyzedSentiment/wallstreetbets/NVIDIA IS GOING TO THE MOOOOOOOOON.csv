This is a well-known concept in the field of machine learning and deep learning, but it seems like many people are still struggling to understand it. The idea is that as you increase the amount of compute power available, the model's accuracy will continue to grow linearly, but at a slower rate than before. This is because the law of diminishing returns starts to kick in, and each additional unit of compute power has less of an impact on the model's performance.

You only need the massive linear algebra compute for doing the training, and as the models reach closer and closer to a stable state, they'll be switched over to simpler compute modes - inference, the act of making predictions, which is how they generate stuff isn't very compute intensive.This is why Nvidia wants to buy ARM or Intel or anyone who has the high performance von Neumann compute core that can fill in the gap. Essentially, all they want is the IP with no restrictions so they can apply their patents to the acquisitions patents without patent infringement being a problem...This is how they'll attack bottlenecks we can't see but their engineers are well aware of, but unless they get the freedom of that side of the IP they'll be hindered long term. Generally speaking, the patent industry has been holding back CPU speeds for decades, and I think soon, we're going to have a breakthrough in that regard one way or another.I think Nvidia is a safe bet, at least for the next 5 years... but... things have to change for it to be a safe bet for another 5 years... but... I think things will change.Don't get het up about one technology that you've seen that you think is going to change everything, beware of phrases like game changer, and paradigm shifting.... We live in an age where tech is doubling every 6 months or less.Also, it's easily possible to dethrone Nvidia, the maths is well understood, and there are already ways to accelerate which can outperform Nvidia on a mm^2 per matrix operation, and there's upcoming silicon which will make this sort of stuff mobile as hell.Nvidia was an upstart that dethroned 3DFX with a chip half the size doing 4 times the work.
