,,"It's a mixed bag. Quoting their CFO Susan Li on Meta's last conference call (Q2 2024):On our core AI work, we continue to take a very ROI-based approach to our investment here. We're still seeing strong returns as improvements to both engagement and ad performance have translated into revenue gains, and it makes sense for us to continue investing here. Gen AI is where we're much earlier, as Mark just mentioned in his comments. We don't expect our gen AI products to be a meaningful driver of revenue in '24. But we do expect that they're going to open up new revenue opportunities over time that will enable us to generate a solid return off of our investment while we're also open sourcing subsequent generations of Llama.In other words, ""No meaningful revenues in 2024 from generative AI products (the thing getting all the hype), but they'll come eventually... trust me bro.""",2,,0.545,NEGATIVE,0.631

NVDA isn't a bubble, they have the revenue to justify the price, and the quality and reputation.I'm sure there are a lot of weak stocks out there that are inflated by AI hype, and it's true that it seems companies can't really quantify the revenue growth from their AI movement. But there's no denying AI will change the course of human civilization, and already has.The AI leaders aren't bubbles they are some of the biggest most profitable companies that have ever existed.

NVDA could care less whether you think their gaming GPU is an impressive upgrade, you either need a GPU and will buy one or you don't. But when they are flipping B100 dies to Elon and Bezos for $50,000 a pop and they are fighting over who will be allowed to buy more, NVDA doesn't need to impress you.The NVDA that was a niche company that made cool stuff for gamers and some niche professional applications is dead.
