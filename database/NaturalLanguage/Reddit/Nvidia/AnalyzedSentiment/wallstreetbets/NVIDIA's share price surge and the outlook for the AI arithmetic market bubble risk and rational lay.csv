,"As NVIDIA's share price has risen sharply in the short term, many have begun to wonder if the industry is facing a turning point or if there is a bubble. From the perspective of the industry giants, GPUs, as representatives of A1 arithmetic chips, are currently far from meeting demand. We can assume that AI applications are still only in their infancy, and there has not yet been a particularly prominent Al burst application in the world. Analyse the results: The AI market is still at an early stage: AI applications, despite explosive growth in recent years, are still at an early stage. The arithmetic power required for current AI applications (e.g., big language modelling, autonomous driving, robotics, etc.), especially GPUs, is still in the pre-burst stage. The growth of Tesla and the robotics industry, for example, predicts that billions of robots will be needed in the future for arithmetic support. This means that there is a huge potential for growth in AI arithmetic demand over the next few years, especially in inferential computing. GPUs as core hardware for AI: GPUs play a key role in AI inference computing, especially in tasks that require high parallel processing power (e.g., deep learning inference, autonomous driving, robot control, etc.). Although there are already many GPU products on the market, overall, the demand for AI computing power is still in a state of oversupply, and the size of the AI computing power market is likely to continue to expand, especially in the ‘reasoning’ segment of the demand for this segment is the area of high computation, especially in the field of automated driving, cloud computing and so on. Personal view: NVIDIA's leadership in the GPU space is well recognised, but many are beginning to worry about an industry bubble due to the short-term surge in its share price. NVIDIA's dominant position: Currently, NVIDIA is the almost unrivalled leader in the field of AI hardware (especially GPUs), and its products are widely used in AI training and reasoning calculations, especially playing a central role in large-scale data centres and cloud services. NVIDIA's rising share price reflects investors' optimistic expectations about the potential of the AI market. Bubble Risk: As NVIDIA's share price has surged, the market has become sceptical about whether it is overvalued. NVIDIA's high valuation could lead to the formation of a bubble, especially if its products and technologies are not sufficiently digested by the market. While the AI industry is promising, the market is volatile in the short term and the rise of competitors (e.g. AMD) could change the market landscape. Therefore, investors and industry observers need to be wary of market overheating and short-term speculation. Core view: US tech giants (e.g. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook) are supportive of NVIDIA's technology, but they will also support NVIDIA's competitors, such as AMD, in order to avoid the arithmetic market being monopolised by one company and to ensure the sustainable development of the industry. Analyse the results: Rational rather than short-term profit-driven: the behaviour of these tech giants suggests that they are not simply pursuing short-term profit when purchasing AI arithmetic, but are planning the security and sustainability of their own development in the long term. By supporting competitors such as AMD, these companies avoid the risk of the market becoming too dependent on NVIDIA alone, ensuring diversity in market competition and technological innovation. This kind of rational decision-making is crucial to the healthy development of the AI hardware market. If NVIDIA dominates the AI arithmetic market without competitive pressure, it could lead to overpricing, affecting the interests of other tech giants. As a result, companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon prefer to ensure diversity and healthy competition in the AI arithmetic market by supporting competitors such as AMD. In summary: future outlook and risks Huge potential for AI arithmetic: The demand for AI arithmetic is far from reaching its ceiling, especially in the area of inferential computing, and the market demand for GPUs will continue to grow as robotics and autonomous driving technologies evolve. The adoption of AI technologies will generate even more demand for arithmetic power in the coming decades, especially in emerging technologies such as robotics and autonomous driving. NVIDIA's dominance and risks: While NVIDIA's dominance in the AI hardware space cannot be ignored, the sharp rise in its share price and high market valuation have raised concerns about the existence of a bubble. Future technological competition, especially the rise of competitors such as AMD, may affect NVIDIA's market share. Long-term layout of industry giants: U.S. tech giants are very rational when investing in AI arithmetic, they will not simply pursue short-term benefits, but pay more attention to the diversity of the arithmetic market and the sustainability of the technology, to ensure that they can be invincible in the competition in the coming years. The AI arithmetic market is full of great potential, but is still in the early stages of development.

Although there are already many GPU products on the market, overall, the demand for AI computing power is still in a state of oversupply, and the size of the AI computing power market is likely to continue to expand, especially in the ‘reasoning’ segment of the demand for this segment is the area of high computation, especially in the field of automated driving, cloud computing and so on. Personal view: NVIDIA's leadership in the GPU space is well recognised, but many are beginning to worry about an industry bubble due to the short-term surge in its share price. NVIDIA's dominant position: Currently, NVIDIA is the almost unrivalled leader in the field of AI hardware (especially GPUs), and its products are widely used in AI training and reasoning calculations, especially playing a central role in large-scale data centres and cloud services. NVIDIA's rising share price reflects investors' optimistic expectations about the potential of the AI market. Bubble Risk: As NVIDIA's share price has surged, the market has become sceptical about whether it is overvalued. NVIDIA's high valuation could lead to the formation of a bubble, especially if its products and technologies are not sufficiently digested by the market. While the AI industry is promising, the market is volatile in the short term and the rise of competitors (e.g. AMD) could change the market landscape. Therefore, investors and industry observers need to be wary of market overheating and short-term speculation. Core view: US tech giants (e.g. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook) are supportive of NVIDIA's technology, but they will also support NVIDIA's competitors, such as AMD, in order to avoid the arithmetic market being monopolised by one company and to ensure the sustainable development of the industry. Analyse the results: Rational rather than short-term profit-driven: the behaviour of these tech giants suggests that they are not simply pursuing short-term profit when purchasing AI arithmetic, but are planning the security and sustainability of their own development in the long term. By supporting competitors such as AMD, these companies avoid the risk of the market becoming too dependent on NVIDIA alone, ensuring diversity in market competition and technological innovation. This kind of rational decision-making is crucial to the healthy development of the AI hardware market. If NVIDIA dominates the AI arithmetic market without competitive pressure, it could lead to overpricing, affecting the interests of other tech giants. As a result, companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon prefer to ensure diversity and healthy competition in the AI arithmetic market by supporting competitors such as AMD. In summary: future outlook and risks Huge potential for AI arithmetic: The demand for AI arithmetic is far from reaching its ceiling, especially in the area of inferential computing, and the market demand for GPUs will continue to grow as robotics and autonomous driving technologies evolve. The adoption of AI technologies will generate even more demand for arithmetic power in the coming decades, especially in emerging technologies such as robotics and autonomous driving. NVIDIA's dominance and risks: While NVIDIA's dominance in the AI hardware space cannot be ignored, the sharp rise in its share price and high market valuation have raised concerns about the existence of a bubble. Future technological competition, especially the rise of competitors such as AMD, may affect NVIDIA's market share. Long-term layout of industry giants: U.S. tech giants are very rational when investing in AI arithmetic, they will not simply pursue short-term benefits, but pay more attention to the diversity of the arithmetic market and the sustainability of the technology, to ensure that they can be invincible in the competition in the coming years. The AI arithmetic market is full of great potential, but is still in the early stages of development.

,"As NVIDIA's share price has risen sharply in the short term, many have begun to wonder if the industry is facing a turning point or if there is a bubble. From the perspective of the industry giants, GPUs, as representatives of A1 arithmetic chips, are currently far from meeting demand.
