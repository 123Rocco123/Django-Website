ITM call example: stock price is 100, sell to open 90C for 10.50Max profit is 100.50/share, breakeven point is 89.50.In both cases, if the stock drops below a certain point, you lose money on the position.When selling ITM calls, you lock in a max profit of the strike price + premium, or slightly more than the value of selling the stock outright. But you have to hold and face the downside risk until expiration. That risk being: below breakeven the shares aren’t called away and you are simply left with a loss on your equity that isn’t made up by the premium sold.

,Held Nvidia for 2 month. I don’t want to be like what I was a few years ago where I held the TESLA bag for 4 years. I was a cuck back then.,"Big mistake dude! 100k profit is nothing. You should probably just have held for the long term, and accumulate more shares when Nvidia goes down or has some temporary corrections. You would likely do a lot better with that approach. Its too bad your past experience with Tesla has soured your investment experience, and given you paper hands. Nvidia is not Tesla, and I think diamond hands are the way to go with Nvidia.I have around 6000 shares of Nvidia at an average cost around $65, and I don't have any plans to sell. To make big money you have to hold these big winners and ride out the ups and downs for the big gains over the years.Trying to jump in and out of Nvidia is usually a losing proposition. You will most likely miss out on the next big rocket up, and then FOMO back in at a high price, only to have the stock pull back again! Lol.Hope you don't regret this move dude. May I ask, why didn't you just hedge a bit instead? Perhaps you could have sold half your position and kept half, instead of selling your full position in Nvidia?",0,,0.534,NEGATIVE,1.0
