So the only other way for competitors to get a chance is to lobby for regulators to do something while they try to find ways to catch up. Nobody has to win, Nvidia just has to lose. That was the same thing that happened when META, MSFT and GOOGL practically monopolized their fields initially, but look at where we are now.The lawsuit will drag on for years to even decades(see DoJ+FTC v META lawsuit, DoJ v Google, DoJ v Microsoft, list goes on), maybe pay a few fines and then nobody's gonna care anymore.
