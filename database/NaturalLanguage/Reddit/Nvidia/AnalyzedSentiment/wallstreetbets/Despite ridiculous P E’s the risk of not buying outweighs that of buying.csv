Currently, there are plenty of alternatives to stocks that will do very well with lower rates. That’s a risk to stocks climbing further. But would get hammered if rates rise up again but we know jpow gonna drop it like it’s hot.End of 21 sucked because you either kept your money in money market and lost out to inflation or put your money in stock and lost on the decline and inflation on top of that.Looking forward to playing edv for big gains this time around and lock in yield.Stocks could certainly continue to go further but will be selling pressure with each high and rotations into other asset classes. Will limit the pace of these upward movements.",1,,0.53,NEGATIVE,1.0

Don’t let fear hold you back from investing","Stocks are overvalued based on every valuation metric I've seen. Go ahead, find me one.Right now, ""forward P/E"" of SPY is at 22, which is breakeven vs the 10 year. With a current P/E around 30, that means that companies will have to grow earnings 30% this year, just for today's prices to make sense. It isn't going to happen.In the past, you could say ""TINA"" and justify buying at any valuation, but with 4% guaranteed returns on bonds, there is now an alternative, so that's not a sound strategy.The only thesis where buying SPY at 570 makes sense is that if you think inflation is either over 4%, or will go over 4% very soon, pushing Treasurys real-negative and forcing us back into the TINA zone. I think this is the most likely explanation of what's happening. Investors have given up all faith in the government to control inflation, and are trading in their fiat toilet paper for any asset that isn't nailed down.",0,,0.538,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Some believe we’re seeing a repeat of 2021, when price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios seemed irrelevant and the market was overly optimistic. While the current market does have a feeling of a ridiculous bullish sentiment( caught, cough NVDIA ) , the macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from 2021. Today, things seem to once again be irrational, I agree to a certain limit . It’s difficult when even stocks like Costco have fan boys attempting to downplay the importance of valuation, P/E since they are ridiculously high, ratios still matter. HOWEVER. Today is much more different then 2021 Please consider the broader context. For instance, the ongoing geopolitical tensions, including wars, have different implications now than in 2021. The Russia Ukrainian war was the only “invasion” that did not see the market gain some short time after. Every other invasion was a buying opportunity. Why ? Back in 2021, the Federal Reserve was tightening monetary policy, which restrained the market’s ability to recover from geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict. This time, we are in a much more stable environment, characterized by a decrease in interested rates with a robust American economy, the exact opposite of 2021 Strong job reports Declining interest rates Falling inflation Invasion signal a buying opportunity the Middle East tensions have had zero impacts.
