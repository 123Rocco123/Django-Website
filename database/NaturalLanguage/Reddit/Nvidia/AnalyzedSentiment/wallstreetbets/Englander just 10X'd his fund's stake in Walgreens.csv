,"Englander just 10X'd his fund's stake in this nearly 12%-yielding healthcare stock But while Israel Englander has been sending shares of the hottest AI stock on the planet to the chopping block, he's been busy purchasing shares of pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA), which is trading at levels last observed in the late 20th century and yielding more than 11.5%! During the September-ended quarter, Englander's fund bought 5,138,342 shares of Walgreens, which increased its position by a whopping 953% in just three months! It should be noted that Millennium commonly hedges its common-stock holdings with put and call options, which is the case with both Nvidia and Walgreens Boots Alliance. To say that things have been challenging for Walgreens would be nothing short of an understatement. It's facing growing online pharmacy pressure from the likes of Amazon, has endured complications (i.e., sizable writedowns) in its efforts to become a healthcare-services company, and has even had its operating results negatively impacted in select markets by theft. Despite these challenges, which have slashed Walgreens Boots Alliance's share price by more than 90% since it hit an all-time high, Englander and his team have piled in. One of the primary catalysts for Walgreens was the appointment of Tim Wentworth as CEO in October 2023. Whereas prior CEO Rosalind Brewer was a seasoned retail leader but lacked healthcare experience, Wentworth brings decades of healthcare leadership to the table. While his rip-off-the-Band-Aid approach has been a bit of a shock to Wall Street and investors, he's not been shy about laying out his long-term vision for Walgreens. For the moment, the company is focused on bringing down costs, as well as promoting higher-margin initiatives. The plan is to close 1,200 of its roughly 8,500 U.S. stores over the next three fiscal years, which will lower its operating expenses and focus the company's efforts on areas of higher opportunity. Furthermore, Wentworth intends to keep promoting its healthcare-services transition. Even though its partnership with and investment in VillageMD has led to sizable writedowns, Walgreens' chief believes the company is moving toward recurring profitability from its co-located primary care clinics. As of this writing, Walgreens Boots Alliance is yielding an almost unfathomable 11.5%. However, with Walgreens in cost-cutting mode and the company attempting a multiyear turnaround, it wouldn't be surprising if this payout was cut again or shelved entirely to preserve cash. While I do believe Walgreens Boots Alliance has the tools to effect a turnaround, it's going to be a slow process filled with plenty of potholes and speed bumps.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

Englander knew something. This shitshow lost $8.6B in 2024 and gonna close 1200 stores. But private equity loves this kinda mess. Gonna break it up and sell the pieces. Stores, real estate, pharmacy biz - all separate deals. Looking at those numbers they're basically giving it away rn. Smart money piling in before the buyout premium hits.",0,0.509,NEGATIVE,1.0
