,,"Consider for a moment that the entire United States economy, arguably the world economy, has been ""growing"" thanks to technology companies that don't actually make money for nearly twenty years now. You could throw a dart at a set of tech tickers valuated in the tens of billions and hit one that has negative EPS.Consider that most industry sectors have returned a modest but historically applaudable 5-8% and if you REALLY found a winner, 10%. With present trading, people expect 50-500% in weeks/months and it simply isn't sustainable. It's a fantasy.Consider that every single bit of the entire tech industry is an interwoven web of spending between tech giants and the smaller tech companies, of which there are presently thousands, that have IPO'ed in the last decade. They're all pushing the same narrative simultaneously - AI is going to revolutionize everything and you best get onboard or you will get left behind. Their balance sheets are wholly dependent on each other.In short, the end of this present AI bubble would cease the ongoing promise of catching up to P/E ratios these companies are probably literally never going to see. When it goes, it's going to take the entire market with it, full stop.",1,0.527,NEGATIVE,0.993,0.527,0.993
