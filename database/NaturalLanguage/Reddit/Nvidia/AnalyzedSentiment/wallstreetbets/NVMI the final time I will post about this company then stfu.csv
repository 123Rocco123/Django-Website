They're dominating backend semis and wafer packaging now too.Their Nova Fit ML shit actually works. Not some marketing BS. Major customer already using it for GAA apps.Revenue growing 39% YoY. Crushing WFE growth by 1.5x. Raw numbers don't lie.Best part? Most of the gate-all-around revenue isn't even hitting yet. That's next year. Adds 30% more process steps = more $$$This is peak WSB.
