I think there’s some things outsiders don’t understand.Amazon was a growth company that went all out during Covid and over stretched. They did some layoffs which I don’t love, but a lot of those people were working a couple hours a day max. Many had transferred from other roles when they saw these sweet gigs working from home and no real work, which should’ve been a red flag as you easily become no longer needed. Then they got laid off.I still work with a lot of people whose job it is to support our buildings. Most of them are supporting a region with 6-10 buildings. Working from home, these folks are more often than not, extremely hard to get ahold of. Supporting my site should be 1/8th of your job, but you take 4-5 hours to respond to my message or I don’t hear from you for weeks at a time. What’re you doing during that time?A lot of folks work really hard from home, but Amazon knows a lot of folks aren’t putting remotely close to 40 hours of deliverables out. RTO will weed out those who aren’t working, or in some cases working a second job at the same time, and not see deliverables drop by much.People supporting my business line were part of the layoffs and I saw almost zero change in the support we were getting. This is what Amazon is aiming for because there’s still a lot of bloat.It sucks for a lot of people for sure. I’d be pissed. But my guess is we will see Amazon get rid of more bloat, see very little change in productivity (if not an increase) and spend less money. I honestly don’t have an opinion on jassy, but the stock price has about doubled in his time in charges and is currently just below the ATH (which was hit under him).
