This was not “previously anticipated” and could be the factor that beats expectations on Nov 12th as the revenue from MCSU was not accounted for in estimates. “A deal with MUSC Health, a top South Carolina hospital, could boost SoundHound's earnings above expectations next quarter. The organization brought in over $8 billion in gross patient revenue in fiscal 2023. Given its massive size, SoundHound could generate significant revenue from the deal announced on Aug. 28 in the quarter ending Sept. 30.

You might be right in saying it is a small portion for a pilot program.
