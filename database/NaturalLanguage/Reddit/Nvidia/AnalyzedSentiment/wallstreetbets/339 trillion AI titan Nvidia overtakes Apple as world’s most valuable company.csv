,,"I don't know where they got their numbers. But Nvidia has P/E ratio of 63 right now according to Yahoo finance. Besides recent trends, the S&P 500 hovered between 10 and 20 P/E ratio. So Nvidia is currently between 3 and 6 times the historical average P/E ratioI understand a lot of people buy it expecting growth. But how much growth can we reasonably expect for a single company?

,,"Very interesting. The next few years will definitely be interesting to watch. I can imagine Nvidia growing more, although I think one difference is that EIT maintained a monopoly through use of force as well (they had a standing army and used government standing armies). I think Nvidia, while very innovative, doesn't have a total monopoly, and even their patent protection is only honored in the US and Europe and a few key Western alies.
