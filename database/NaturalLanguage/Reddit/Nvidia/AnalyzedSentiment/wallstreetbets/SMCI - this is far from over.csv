,"SMCI has some nice niche products, but SMCI’s margins are tiny because they offer nothing proprietary. I have a feeling that they were on a roll, but the management couldn't quite keep up with success and the stock went up too high in valuation believing the company internally could keep up with the pressure. For a company which has no moat, has shrinking margins and is again encompassed in accounting problems, I don't see an upside. I can understand that mistakes happen, but this is becoming a pattern recidivist behavior, and in my book, the trust is seriously shaken, if not lost. I can understand skepticism around Hindenburg report, but withholding the release of annual report (10-K) is a big no no. Some jumped to SMCI's defense that they did so because of Hindenburg report to make double-checks, but why would you need to double-check a report which was previously audited by independent party (EY) and is supposed to be ready for submitting weeks ahead of deadline? For those that aren't aware, 10-K is a kind of report that contains comprehensive overview of company's financial performance over the past fiscal year, but also includes audited financial statements, unlike quarter reports which are less detailed and are unaudited (link to 10-Q). 10-K also includes discussion and analysis (MD&A), risk factors, organizational structure, executive compensation, subsidiaries, and more. Moreover, there are reports that buyers (such as CoreWeave, Tesla, Amazon AWS, Digital Ocean, to name a few) are switching to competition (which has higher margins), and from being the top customer, to having Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang publicly endorsing their competiton (“Nobody is better at building end-to-end systems of very large scale for the enterprise than Dell.”),one has to ask - what is really going on? I believe that, at least partially, the reason lies in that (to quote mod from SCMI subreddit) SMCI was very cheap in 2022 and 2023 when the circumstances were different. Nobody knew about their success back then, which allowed them to avoid competition and actually increase sales and margins. Now is a different story: they are at diseconomies of scale and diluting shareholders to finance their operations. I wouldn’t be surprised to see SMCI drop to the 300s or lower and never recover because they are just a commodity company now.

Such forward looking statements may relate to, among other things, contributions to our future growth to be made by the new director. Such forward looking statements do not constitute guarantees of future performance and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, including: (i) our quarterly operating results may fluctuate, which could cause rapid declines in our stock price, (ii) as we increasingly target larger customers and larger sales opportunities, our customer base may become more concentrated, our cost of sales may increase, our margins may be lower and our sales may be less predictable, (iii) if we fail to meet publicly announced financial guidance or other expectations about our business, our stock could decline in value, (iv) the average sales prices for our server solutions could decline if customers do not continue to purchase our latest generation products or additional components, and (v) adverse economic conditions may harm our business. Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or suggested in any forward looking statements are contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including those factors discussed under the caption “Risk Factors” in such filings, particularly in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed thereafter.”Found here link",0,,0.55,NEGATIVE,0.994

For a company which has no moat, has shrinking margins and is again encompassed in accounting problems, I don't see an upside. I can understand that mistakes happen, but this is becoming a pattern recidivist behavior, and in my book, the trust is seriously shaken, if not lost. I can understand skepticism around Hindenburg report, but withholding the release of annual report (10-K) is a big no no.

I believe that, at least partially, the reason lies in that (to quote mod from SCMI subreddit) SMCI was very cheap in 2022 and 2023 when the circumstances were different. Nobody knew about their success back then, which allowed them to avoid competition and actually increase sales and margins. Now is a different story: they are at diseconomies of scale and diluting shareholders to finance their operations. I wouldn’t be surprised to see SMCI drop to the 300s or lower and never recover because they are just a commodity company now.

I can understand skepticism around Hindenburg report, but withholding the release of annual report (10-K) is a big no no. Some jumped to SMCI's defense that they did so because of Hindenburg report to make double-checks, but why would you need to double-check a report which was previously audited by independent party (EY) and is supposed to be ready for submitting weeks ahead of deadline? For those that aren't aware, 10-K is a kind of report that contains comprehensive overview of company's financial performance over the past fiscal year, but also includes audited financial statements, unlike quarter reports which are less detailed and are unaudited (link to 10-Q). 10-K also includes discussion and analysis (MD&A), risk factors, organizational structure, executive compensation, subsidiaries, and more. Moreover, there are reports that buyers (such as CoreWeave, Tesla, Amazon AWS, Digital Ocean, to name a few) are switching to competition (which has higher margins), and from being the top customer, to having Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang publicly endorsing their competiton (“Nobody is better at building end-to-end systems of very large scale for the enterprise than Dell.”),one has to ask - what is really going on? I believe that, at least partially, the reason lies in that (to quote mod from SCMI subreddit) SMCI was very cheap in 2022 and 2023 when the circumstances were different. Nobody knew about their success back then, which allowed them to avoid competition and actually increase sales and margins. Now is a different story: they are at diseconomies of scale and diluting shareholders to finance their operations. I wouldn’t be surprised to see SMCI drop to the 300s or lower and never recover because they are just a commodity company now. Dell, HPE and Lenovo aren't resting and have joined the server building market in the meantime. Institutions which haven't closed their positions already will have a hard time explaining why they kept their position when this stocks sinks even more. Even insiders believe in everything so much, that the insider net stock purchases in last 12 months amount to 0. One would think that they would grab stocks with hands over fist with this ""great discount"", but I guess they don't want more shares.

With increased CAPEX and lower margins, the need for money for R&D, and with history of dilutions, I'd be more concerned of further dilutions. To top it all of, in all these commotions, some of you might have missed a little interesting detail. On August 15, 2024 SMCI added Susie Giordano to it's board of directors. (Link) Her background is law, and Ms. Giordano has over 25 years of experience advising executive management and board directors on a wide range of topics, including strategy, litigation, compliance, regulatory matters, corporate governance, ESG, executive compensation, financial reporting, crisis management*, cybersecurity, human capital management, investor relations, M&A, securities, shareholder engagement, and treasury matters. To me, this is very peculiar timing. She gets appointed to board of directors just mere (12) days before Hindenburg reveals their report and before we find out about 10-K delay, indicating that there could be undisclosed problems and SMCI management is/was aware of it. Where there's smoke, there's fire. With all that said, I am very bearish on this stock and will be buying long puts. TL;DR: SMCI is a total dumpster fire - no moat, shrinking margins, losing big clients, and can't even get their 10-K out. Insiders aren't touching the stock, and now they're bringing in a lawyer - betting on this sinking ship with puts all day!",sub 400 this week my feelings especially with that late filing and saying “they believe nothing will be different” mentally is skeptical. If market goes red this week just know they aren’t going straight down to $330,2,,0.533,NEGATIVE,0.996
