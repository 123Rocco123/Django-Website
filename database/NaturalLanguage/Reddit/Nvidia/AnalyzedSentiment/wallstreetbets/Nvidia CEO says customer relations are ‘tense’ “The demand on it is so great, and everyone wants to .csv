There is no way these companies are stealthily making bank while no company is showing it on the books. Oracle is one of the leaders in rollout, their growth is not even in the same ballpark.",2,0.566,NEGATIVE,0.98
,,"‚Äúfor every $1 spent on Nvidia infrastructure, cloud service providers can earn $5 in GPU hosting revenue over four years.Similarly, the analyst said that $1 spent on Nvidia H200 servers can generate $7 in revenue from Llama3 tokens over the same period.Broadly, companies are realizing an average return of $3.5 in revenue for every $1 invested in AI.‚Äùhttps://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/for-every-1-spent-on-nvidia-infrastructure-cloud-service-providers-can-earn-5-in-gpu-hosting-analyst-1033508893#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20Muse%20said%20that,tokens%20over%20the%20same%20period.Oracle just doubled their projected capex. They ordered $120k blackwells for $5.5 billion and their operations are full.Look at revenue growth of the hyperscalers, and then pit it against their capex.In addition to that, look at meta in particular. AI recommendations increased reels watch time by 8-10% in a quarter. The revenue implications for that are insane.Verizon is cutting 5,000 jobs because they‚Äôre leaning into AI and the jobs are becoming less efficient.Then you have GPTo1 which placed 89th percentile in the us math Olympiad, so these jobs will continue to be cut. Ai isn‚Äôt just revenue generating, it‚Äôs cost-cutting too.Just because you don‚Äôt see the flat revenue, doesn‚Äôt mean the changes aren‚Äôt there.

,,"You're confirming what I stated - crickets on the question of which hyperscaler (or equivalent) people are rushing to buy into. Yes Oracle is up, just barely outperforming QQQ on the 1-3 year range. People aren't piling into that trade. Which company leveraging AI is seeing big moves?Oracle net profit is around $12bn annually. You stated they're dropping $5.5bn in Blackwell. So why aren't they being priced for ~50%+ jump in net profit for next year? As the market isn't buying that story of $5 in 4 years.",4,0.587,NEGATIVE,1.0

,,"The article you posted had no citation of $5 per $1 other than an analyst said so. And when somebody says that they ""Can"" get that return it's even less meaningful. The main concern is that let's assume for a second the most bullish case we can for AI - that it indeed did create so much better recommendations that it was the cause for more growth, betters ads, and better returns and there were no other factors like business cycles or any consumer behavioral changes. Even then it would still be suspect if spending billions more would create better ads or recommendations after that, ie can it keep scaling indefinitely... and is it worth spending billions of dollars for brand new chips, or is what you bought last year still fine AND do you in fact need to buy even more chips than you did last year. Nvida IS a great company, but blindly believing it will DEFINITELY accelerate growth and continue accelerating growth when most of it's customers are the extremely large cap tech companies (ie they can't find new large customers like that every day), is delusionally optimistic.",2,0.569,NEGATIVE,1.0
