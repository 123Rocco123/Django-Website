,"AMZN call or put? I am very excited for Amazons upcoming QE in October, but at the same time sceptical on which side should I play on. Call or Put? Why I think call: ‚úÖ UK‚Äôs Chancellor announces ¬£8 billion Amazon Web Services investment ‚úÖ Amazon announces record-breaking sales for 2024 Prime Day event which is and isn‚Äôt relevant for this upcoming QE since the Prime Day event was in July. ‚úÖ AWS‚Ä¶ need I say more Why I think Puts: ‚ùå The last QE did relatively good on numbers, except for the expected growth for AWS which drove the stock down on the day after QE report ‚ùå Nothing in my due diligence stroke attention on exponential growth in AWS except for the UK‚Äôs investment which can still not overide the highly anticipated and demanded growth and pressure on AWS ‚ùå A Huge Rise in Amazon Sellers Fees making it unprofitable to sell for SOME sellers. Now for the facts which I can‚Äôt even decide if it will or will not affect QE‚Äôs movement: üé≠ Employees coming back to office from working remotely??????????? People will either quit or productivity will increase. Most likely the first one since most of them are probably in some sort of exotic countries or Islands. üé≠ Skynopy Inks Partnership With Amazon AWS???? Now a Paris-based satellite connectivity startup linking up with Amazon. Can either end up like the recent GTA definitive edition or like citroen cars. In neither scenarios beneficial. üé≠ White House teams up with Nvidia, Amazon on AI data centre strategy. Yeah ok and what if Biden loses will the other Telected Rpresident Uwill Mcontinue Pto team up? Or will this be money in the drain type of situation Just seen my student debt so might be speaking in Monkey but Im still for some reason expecting good results.
