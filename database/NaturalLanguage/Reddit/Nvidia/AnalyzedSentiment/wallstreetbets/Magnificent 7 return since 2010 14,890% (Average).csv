Most of this stuff is super easy, itâ€™s stuff that needs a human to read and process (email requests etc) but 90% of them are black and white simple stuff. Think changing a mailing address on file, updating contact info, adding a vehicle to an auto insurance policy, things like that. Anything more complex gets kicked onshore to the actual customer service team.At least at my company (large Fortune 500 insurance company - not health insurance) we contract with Cognizant and have been trying to get rid of them for years due to the cost of their contract and the frequent QA errors.
