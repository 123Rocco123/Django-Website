,"NVIDIA has crushed it by essentially “selling the shovels” for the AI gold rush. Looking ahead 2-3 years, I think they’ll continue to rise, but I’m also betting on some other industries that could see massive growth thanks to AI infrastructure demands, especially in energy. AI is energy-hungry, and it’s going to need some serious juice. That’s why I’m keeping an eye on a few key areas: Nuclear Energy – We’ll need reliable, scalable power to fuel AI data centers, and nuclear could be a major player. Transformers & Grid Infrastructure – The grid has to adapt to support the crazy power consumption that AI is driving. Think about companies working on energy grids and transformers. Real Estate for AI Infrastructure – Data centers and industrial spaces are the backbone of AI. I’m looking at real estate investments tied to building out these tech hubs. One stock that’s caught my eye is Oklo, which was co-founded by Sam Altman. They're diving into advanced nuclear energy, and with the power demands AI will need, this could be a sleeper hit. What do you all think? Anyone else looking at energy and infrastructure plays for AI?",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999,0.5,0.999
