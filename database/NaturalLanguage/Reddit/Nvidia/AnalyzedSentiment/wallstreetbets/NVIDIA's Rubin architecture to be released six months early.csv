,nan,"They are on an yearly release cycle, so this was expected. The change here is TSM ready to scale production to meet the new design, and hbm4 production scaling up.

,nan,It literally says The Next Great Thing is released 6 months earlier than expected.Obviously this usually has some cannibalizing effect on sales of current things as customers may cancel or not order the current thing if they know something better is around the corner (earlier than expected).,2,0.563,NEGATIVE,1.0
