People like you expect the stock to go up; normally everyone want the stocks to go up. Going down is catastrophe for a ton of calls. It will take SPY with it.As far as I'm concerned, post-earnings short-term price movement is a coinflip. I hold shares, not options, I don't care whether it goes up or down immediately after earnings. I'm arguing you on your idea that it's going to go down because it did last time. That's just not how the stock market and earnings work. The previous earnings have the biggest influence on sentiment for the upcoming earnings. Again, the reason it went down last time is because everyone thought it was going up. The fact it didn't and people like you are the literal proof that it is no longer the case. There are people who think it's going to keep going up and that's why I'm saying it's a coinflip. I work for an investment bank and while I can't tell you how we do our trades, I can tell you that guidance weighs a LOT heavier than earnings.You’re betting nvidia will go up base on the amount of people purchasing the stock over the actual earning report and that’s foolish.Earnings mean absolutely nothing without demand and investor sentiment. Short-term price movement is quite literally based on retail sentiment, that's how supply/demand works... If it was strictly based on earnings, wouldn't it automatically go up when earnings are up? The market (especially short-term price action) is not nearly as efficient as you think it is. If a company posted 200b earnings this quarter and announced they would keep growing for 1 year, but they said that they would go bankrupt sometime in the near future, everyone would dump the stock and gamblers would be left bagholding regardless of how strong the current earnings are.If nvidia can’t outperform by a large margin, the value will drop.What is a 'large margin'? That's incredibly arbitrary and sounds like something you can change at will to fit your narrative if the price happens to go up after earnings. Can you put a number on it?That already a sign IMO of bearish/nervousness. Too much attention isn’t always good.Nvidia has been getting a crapton of attention for 2 years now, it hasn't stopped them in any of the earnings before the previous one lol... I've been on the Nvidia bandwagon since the end of 2020 and every single year without fail, there are people who are bearish/nervous and think the stock is overpriced, it's nothing new. It is literally the same loop every. single. year.If anything, people being nervous/bearish about the upcoming earnings is literally what gives it a chance to go up. It's a positive. Because as I said in my previous argument, if everyone thinks it's going up, everyone is jumping in pre-earnings to ride the wave and there won't be anyone left to buy after earnings are posted.I understand you lost money on your previous calls and it is important to learn from your mistakes, but it's also important to make sure you understand what happened in order to learn properly rather than just think ""Well, it happened last time, so I'm not letting it happen this time."" It wasn't just the case that Nvidia didn't beat earnings by enough (though it did play a part). An overwhelmingly bullish sentiment is not good for a stock's consistency and predictability and the sentiment was overwhelmingly bullish prior to last earnings. By the time earnings come, investor sentiment is already fully priced in and you need bearish sentiments to allow the stock to run. I can't repeat this enough: If all the upside is already priced in, there is only down to go. In order for the stock to be sitting at ~140 now, you need people who think it's going to go to 200, but you also need people who think it's overvalued and going to go back down to 100, otherwise the price would already be at 200...source: the knowledge acquired from 18 years of working at an investment bank.",6,0.56,NEGATIVE,1.0,0.56,1.0
