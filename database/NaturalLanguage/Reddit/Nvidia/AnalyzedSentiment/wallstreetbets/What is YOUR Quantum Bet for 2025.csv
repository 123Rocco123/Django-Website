Plus you get a nice bonus from the fact that this company has actual products that generate meaningful revenue and profit. I can nearly guarantee that every pure quantum play is going to go bankrupt in the next few years. They are just there to pay a few smart PhD physicists a buttload of money before starting all over again.
