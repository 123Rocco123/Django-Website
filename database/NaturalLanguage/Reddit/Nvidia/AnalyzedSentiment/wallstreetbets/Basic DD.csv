,"One way of determining the fair value of a company is by projecting its free cash flow. NVIDIAs free cash flow stagnated according to August's report, and so did Morningstar's calculated fair value. The federal reserve rate is also inversely proportional to a company's fair value as follows: Fair value ~ projected free cash flow/(interest rate - growth rate) Without plugging in values for free cash flow we can leave our answer in terms of free cash flow and its units will be those of a familiar multiplier. Plugging in 5% for interest rate and subtracting 2% for the growth rate yields 1/(0.05 - 0.02) = 1/0.03 = 33 What do you know? Its right around the multiplier for SPY. Let's plug in the new interest rate: 1/(0.045 - 0.02) = 44 Wow! A fifty basis point cut results in a 30% increase in fair value of the overall market. What if we back calculate using NVDIA's multiplier to estimate a terminal growth rate: 1/(0.05 - x) = 50 x = 0.030 Use this value to calculate post rate cut fair multiplier: 1/(0.045 - 0.030) = 66 This is also over a 30% increase for the fair value of NVIDIA giving a fair value for NVDA of 152 right now.

,"One way of determining the fair value of a company is by projecting its free cash flow. NVIDIAs free cash flow stagnated according to August's report, and so did Morningstar's calculated fair value. The federal reserve rate is also inversely proportional to a company's fair value as follows: Fair value ~ projected free cash flow/(interest rate - growth rate) Without plugging in values for free cash flow we can leave our answer in terms of free cash flow and its units will be those of a familiar multiplier. Plugging in 5% for interest rate and subtracting 2% for the growth rate yields 1/(0.05 - 0.02) = 1/0.03 = 33 What do you know? Its right around the multiplier for SPY. Let's plug in the new interest rate: 1/(0.045 - 0.02) = 44 Wow! A fifty basis point cut results in a 30% increase in fair value of the overall market. What if we back calculate using NVDIA's multiplier to estimate a terminal growth rate: 1/(0.05 - x) = 50 x = 0.030 Use this value to calculate post rate cut fair multiplier: 1/(0.045 - 0.030) = 66 This is also over a 30% increase for the fair value of NVIDIA giving a fair value for NVDA of 152 right now. I am reiterating my price target of 160 by the end of October for NVDA. God bless America.","what does FCF of 1 mean? they make $1 per year?(honest question, i'm regarded af and trying to learn)",0,,0.6,POSITIVE,0.502
