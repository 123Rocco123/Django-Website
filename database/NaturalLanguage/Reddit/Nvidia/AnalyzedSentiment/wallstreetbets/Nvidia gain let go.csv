,,Could someone explain this im a newbie how is it in the green b4 the break even?,0,0.507,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,I explain it to u... it green because it time. The contract is for June 2025. It must hit 145. The closer it get it will be green. Your bypassing thr premium. That why alot of people do long term options it can be 6 dollars away or 10 and if be profit if it within the time frame. The closer it get like a month or 2 before it 145 ur premium cost of profit will go down. So if you hit 140 now u be up like 30k. But if it hit 140 by June expiring u be down 3k.,1,0.529,NEGATIVE,1.0
