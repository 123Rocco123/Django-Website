I think spikes like these both up and down happen when an inpatient regard hits the market sell/buy button with too much money.You can test out this theory yourself by selling all your stocks and do a market buy in a small company or crypto coin. You will see the spike and see that you actually did massively overpay for a portion of your order.Don‚Äôt ask me how I know this.Considering the stock market is basically open all the time, with so many players, and also done electronically, it‚Äôs not that unlikely for accidents like these happen‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a lot more money out there than we realize.",1,0.56,NEGATIVE,0.993

I am assuming its more of a broker-data-issue than someone actually trading at $140 for fun after the circus closed.,Bad theory for this stock specifically. Trades for a big stock like NVDA happen multiple times per second even pre market or after market. For smaller stocks sure but this is obviously a technical glitch as it doesn't show it anymore. If you check trades there was also never a trade at such a price.https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/NVDA/Stock-Price-Action/After-Hours-VWAPhttps://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/nvda/pre-market-trades,2,0.566,NEGATIVE,1.0

It's wild how much the data can get skewed with limited trades in after-hours. People really need to understand that those spikes aren‚Äôt always what they seem. It's not uncommon for a broker to slip up and create these outliers. Quite a gamble if someone was trying to play around in that time frame.,0,0.512,NEGATIVE,0.991

All exchanges that report on the ticker have to do so within a very tight timeframe otherwise it is meaningless data.Rather, since in after hours there are no market makers, if a broker fat fingers an order as a market order there is always the risk it will get filled at an out of whack price.

I am assuming its more of a broker-data-issue than someone actually trading at $140 for fun after the circus closed.,"This question pops out every two weeks ...There was a single trade with that price in that time slice with likely no other trades so the chart shows a spike.As someone said, data is not normalized properly. To elaborate:Transactions happen in ""near"" real time.Even if you assume that they happen only at a whole second mark, there's 3600 seconds in every hour. To represent daily price movements with that precision you'd need a graph that is tens of thousands pixels wide.The solution is to use larger slices, every horizontal pixel representing multiple seconds or minutes of real time.This works fine for normal trading hours. There are tens, hundreds or thousands of trades executed during every slice so you can just average them to show a price level that is mostly accurate.In pre-market and after-hours there are way less trades being made but the yahoo / google etc don't account for that and the slices remain the same (as far as I can tell) so a single trade with a weird price can distort the graph.In extreme cases you can have some regard fat fingering a few hundreds of $ order and it will show up as a sudden spike on those graphs.",0,0.524,NEGATIVE,0.999
