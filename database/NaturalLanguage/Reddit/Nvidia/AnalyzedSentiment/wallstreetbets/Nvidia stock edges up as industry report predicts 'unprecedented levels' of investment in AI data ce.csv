NPS scores for these support processes are up because customers don't have to wait in queue and can do this in a self-serve manner. Every such call used to cost us 2$, which is money saved. By next year it's expected the CARE team will be cut to 1/3rd. This was unimaginable just a couple of years ago when chatbots were completely useless. If you were doing something routine, like retrieving information, making updates, and responding to queries that can all be handled with an AI agent using RAG models. Said that, for anything intelligent that is off the set pattern, you still need humans.There are dozens of developer productivity tools made in-house in my company, although I feel most are dud. I would imagine in some time they will get better.The coolest thing I have done so far is chat with an AI agent on Slack, which summarized an entire Slack summary with dozens of participants, explained the problem pattern, and ""recommended a solution pattern"" based on one of the hidden confluence pages.
