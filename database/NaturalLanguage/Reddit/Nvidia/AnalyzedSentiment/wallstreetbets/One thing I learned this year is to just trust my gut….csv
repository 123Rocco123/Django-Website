The reality is Nvidia has been the same fucking thing for the last five years. LLMs have been around AI has been around generative AI has been around. So what are you really researching? You’re literally just guessing as to whether or not everybody else is gonna pump money into it too.My 401(k) has been up 30% year over a year for the last five years. Do you know how much research I did? None. I put money into the market because it was literally free real estate.

All I tell myself is that if I really believed in the stock as much as hindsight makes me think i did, I would have invested.But there's also another thing to keep in mind: 10x and 20x stocks have existed since time immemorial, and they will continue to exist.

I’m not just saying Ooooo that looks good I got a good feeling about this one! No that’s actually just roulette and I’m not tryna live like that. Also a big reason I didn’t take the risks is because money is so damn tight and I was trying to have more capital for making decent investments as opposed to smaller or less likely contracts; or shares for things I thought would maybe give me some return on now but probably still had some time or that I didn’t have enough to make more than a 10s of dollars on. so I did the safer thing.
