With gold at 2600, silver hasn't even sustained higher than 30. Silver also has an industrial aspect and I believe that will weaken in the next year or two. ]From a bullion perspective, local coin shops have been flooded with people selling their silver at these prices. Yes, I know investment sales only make up like 20% ofthe price but it reflects the general attitude.Gold is a different story, although there hasn't been crazy buying at local shops at these prices, people haven't been selling nearly as much. Also central banks have been buying at record levels, even at these prices. I believe gold will continue to make a slow crawl toward 3k to 4k. No more rapid surges like 2000 to 2400.",0,0.533,NEGATIVE,1.0

What followed the past gold wash out was a 7x move over the next 10 years. I'm expecting the miners to do much better. 450 Billion in Precious Metals Derivatives OCC dot gov derivatives report Q1 2024. The chart is a little missleading.
