If possible please give some degenerate diligency to support your pick.","My little thesis I have been posting on Reddit: It didn't make sense to me that AMD dropped so hard this year despite the tech sector doing so well. I think it was -5% YTD last week despite being the CPU leader (now that Intel is struggling) and next go to GPU manufacturers..I am bullish on AMD for several reasons-Alternative GPUS at budget when NVDA can't meet supply demand over the coming years.-Hands down the best CPUS for both consumers and data centers. And you need CPUS for inferencing with Al models trained on GPU.-PC market entering the 4-5 year upgrade period next year, especially with windows 10 support ending.-Potential announcements of next gen consoles for which AMD makes custom processors.And before anyone comes saying NVDA is 1000x better than AMD....I agree AMD has nothing over CUDA, and it's a sector that they are years behind NVDA, maybe even too far to catch up.I don't think AMD is ""dead"" in consumer GPUs. I agree most developers make games with NVDA in mind, but it's definitely a budget alternative to NVDA, especially in not so rich counties.And take what I say next with a grain of salt- I think AMD will be the ones to cover up NVDA leftovers. I am also expecting AMD to come up with their own parallel computing platform given their recent acquisitions. I know this is also a long shot, but AMD might get considered to be able to run with CUDA if the demand skyrockets.The reason I went balls deep in my AMD position, is I thought AMD was trading below its fair price.That being said, the fair value of AMD right now is about 150-160 in my opinion.My positions are- 170 C Jan 2026 and 200 C Jan 2026 and 13k worth of shares that I bought over the last 2 weeks.",1,0.573,POSITIVE,0.842
