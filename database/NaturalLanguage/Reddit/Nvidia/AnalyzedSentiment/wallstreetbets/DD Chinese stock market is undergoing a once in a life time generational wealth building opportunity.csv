,"My position is above. TL:DR: China is about to rag pull housing to direct majority of wealth into the stock market (similar to the US). Currently, the majority of wealth of Chinese citizens are in real estate. People brag about how many houses they have in Beijing or Shanghai and they view those properties as retirement vehicles. Those people are about to be rag pulled. Remember the saying, don’t fight the fed? Don’t fight the Xi. For the last 20-30 years, the Chinese stock market is filled with rampant speculation and exit schemes via IPO. That might still be true, but that is about to change too. Yes, the Chinese economy faces tremendous headwind, the real estate bubble is collapsing, tons of animosity with the US, etc, but Xi stumbled upon the pure genius competitive play. You see, each pay check, people PILE into the US market. Over a life time, owning US company generates wealth and allow people to retire. I don’t know about you, but I have zero second thoughts about putting money into SPY, VOO, etc every pay check. As a result, American company like google, nvidia, apple, gets floated like crazy. Meanwhile, stock traders are viewed as gamblers. Everyone knows someone who blown up their account. No one would trust their retirement in the market. The tremendous wealth of the people are literally in brick and mortar (housing). In fact, China has a deflation problem because people LOVE to save. Xi must have stumbled upon a freaking genius play. They see the opportunity to shift wealth and possibly rescue governments from debt by shifting wealth from real estate into stock market. You see, by allowing real estate to eventually go free fall as Chinese people capitulate and pile into stock market, China can solve multiple problem all at once. Government in debt? Probably already positioned into stock market very cheaply and now the people will transfer their wealth to bolster the government. Wanting to become more competitive in tech and brew local AI giants? Instead of having the masses put their piggy bank literally in the wall, you are now mentally training them to pile money into home grown company every month like Americans with their 401k. Housing market collapse? Let it go. You are dumb if you failed to unload grossly overpriced real estate. You see, the situation here, is that all this doesn’t depend on the west. This is a genius play to solve the housing crisis by rag pulling the Chinese boomers and liquidate their retirement funding in the form of realestate and create affordable housings all at once. The ghost towns will still be there but because housing will be allowed to drop it wont matter since the new focus will be to protect the stock market. At the same time this solve the local government debt crisis because they would have gone into stock market ahead of time. The people who are hurt the most are boomers sitting on millions of unrealized gain from housing. At the same time this would also help their companies to be more competitive as tremendous amount of wealth are raised for them to pile into chips and AI. The end result would be a stock market that is persistently rising and generate long term wealth similar to the US one. There will be one day where people literally put money into Chinese stock every month. The west knows this and if US dislike China as much as I think, the institutions will try their hardest to short and crash the Chinese market. It’ll be an epic battle of bulls and bears. The west know that if it can destroy confidence in the Chinese market while housing market is collapsing, it will absolutely eviscerate China. Xi knows this too, and he will use the might of an entire nation to defend the market and kill the shorts. I am not a finance professional and this is not financial advice. Chinese market is incredibly volatile and do so at your own risk. My belief is that it’s best to leverage a small principal into the Chinese market because potential of losses is extreme but gain is extreme as well. Therefore almost all my position is in YINN which is 3x bull. To tell you how the west think about China, Yinn is considered to be a low energy state where as YANG represents the sun and rising energy. Of course on the American market Yang is the short ticker. The best part about this whole situation is that since this is an internal wealth transfer, I don’t even think they depend on the west for this to work (they are robbing their own boomers).

,"My position is above. TL:DR: China is about to rag pull housing to direct majority of wealth into the stock market (similar to the US). Currently, the majority of wealth of Chinese citizens are in real estate. People brag about how many houses they have in Beijing or Shanghai and they view those properties as retirement vehicles. Those people are about to be rag pulled. Remember the saying, don’t fight the fed? Don’t fight the Xi. For the last 20-30 years, the Chinese stock market is filled with rampant speculation and exit schemes via IPO. That might still be true, but that is about to change too. Yes, the Chinese economy faces tremendous headwind, the real estate bubble is collapsing, tons of animosity with the US, etc, but Xi stumbled upon the pure genius competitive play. You see, each pay check, people PILE into the US market. Over a life time, owning US company generates wealth and allow people to retire. I don’t know about you, but I have zero second thoughts about putting money into SPY, VOO, etc every pay check. As a result, American company like google, nvidia, apple, gets floated like crazy. Meanwhile, stock traders are viewed as gamblers. Everyone knows someone who blown up their account. No one would trust their retirement in the market. The tremendous wealth of the people are literally in brick and mortar (housing). In fact, China has a deflation problem because people LOVE to save. Xi must have stumbled upon a freaking genius play. They see the opportunity to shift wealth and possibly rescue governments from debt by shifting wealth from real estate into stock market. You see, by allowing real estate to eventually go free fall as Chinese people capitulate and pile into stock market, China can solve multiple problem all at once. Government in debt? Probably already positioned into stock market very cheaply and now the people will transfer their wealth to bolster the government. Wanting to become more competitive in tech and brew local AI giants? Instead of having the masses put their piggy bank literally in the wall, you are now mentally training them to pile money into home grown company every month like Americans with their 401k. Housing market collapse? Let it go. You are dumb if you failed to unload grossly overpriced real estate. You see, the situation here, is that all this doesn’t depend on the west. This is a genius play to solve the housing crisis by rag pulling the Chinese boomers and liquidate their retirement funding in the form of realestate and create affordable housings all at once. The ghost towns will still be there but because housing will be allowed to drop it wont matter since the new focus will be to protect the stock market. At the same time this solve the local government debt crisis because they would have gone into stock market ahead of time.

,"My position is above. TL:DR: China is about to rag pull housing to direct majority of wealth into the stock market (similar to the US). Currently, the majority of wealth of Chinese citizens are in real estate. People brag about how many houses they have in Beijing or Shanghai and they view those properties as retirement vehicles. Those people are about to be rag pulled. Remember the saying, don’t fight the fed? Don’t fight the Xi. For the last 20-30 years, the Chinese stock market is filled with rampant speculation and exit schemes via IPO. That might still be true, but that is about to change too. Yes, the Chinese economy faces tremendous headwind, the real estate bubble is collapsing, tons of animosity with the US, etc, but Xi stumbled upon the pure genius competitive play. You see, each pay check, people PILE into the US market. Over a life time, owning US company generates wealth and allow people to retire. I don’t know about you, but I have zero second thoughts about putting money into SPY, VOO, etc every pay check. As a result, American company like google, nvidia, apple, gets floated like crazy. Meanwhile, stock traders are viewed as gamblers. Everyone knows someone who blown up their account. No one would trust their retirement in the market. The tremendous wealth of the people are literally in brick and mortar (housing). In fact, China has a deflation problem because people LOVE to save. Xi must have stumbled upon a freaking genius play. They see the opportunity to shift wealth and possibly rescue governments from debt by shifting wealth from real estate into stock market. You see, by allowing real estate to eventually go free fall as Chinese people capitulate and pile into stock market, China can solve multiple problem all at once. Government in debt? Probably already positioned into stock market very cheaply and now the people will transfer their wealth to bolster the government. Wanting to become more competitive in tech and brew local AI giants? Instead of having the masses put their piggy bank literally in the wall, you are now mentally training them to pile money into home grown company every month like Americans with their 401k. Housing market collapse? Let it go. You are dumb if you failed to unload grossly overpriced real estate. You see, the situation here, is that all this doesn’t depend on the west. This is a genius play to solve the housing crisis by rag pulling the Chinese boomers and liquidate their retirement funding in the form of realestate and create affordable housings all at once. The ghost towns will still be there but because housing will be allowed to drop it wont matter since the new focus will be to protect the stock market. At the same time this solve the local government debt crisis because they would have gone into stock market ahead of time. The people who are hurt the most are boomers sitting on millions of unrealized gain from housing. At the same time this would also help their companies to be more competitive as tremendous amount of wealth are raised for them to pile into chips and AI. The end result would be a stock market that is persistently rising and generate long term wealth similar to the US one. There will be one day where people literally put money into Chinese stock every month. The west knows this and if US dislike China as much as I think, the institutions will try their hardest to short and crash the Chinese market. It’ll be an epic battle of bulls and bears.

The first, a survey of Chinese attitudes towards the economy, found that people were growing pessimistic and disillusioned about their prospects. The second is a record of protests, both physical and online, that noted a rise in incidents driven by economic grievances.... Beyond the crisis in real estate, steep public debt and rising unemployment have hit savings and spending. The world’s second-largest economy may miss its own growth target - 5% - this year.https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e95lny0x9o",3,,0.543,NEGATIVE,0.999

,"My position is above. TL:DR: China is about to rag pull housing to direct majority of wealth into the stock market (similar to the US). Currently, the majority of wealth of Chinese citizens are in real estate. People brag about how many houses they have in Beijing or Shanghai and they view those properties as retirement vehicles. Those people are about to be rag pulled. Remember the saying, don’t fight the fed? Don’t fight the Xi. For the last 20-30 years, the Chinese stock market is filled with rampant speculation and exit schemes via IPO. That might still be true, but that is about to change too. Yes, the Chinese economy faces tremendous headwind, the real estate bubble is collapsing, tons of animosity with the US, etc, but Xi stumbled upon the pure genius competitive play. You see, each pay check, people PILE into the US market. Over a life time, owning US company generates wealth and allow people to retire. I don’t know about you, but I have zero second thoughts about putting money into SPY, VOO, etc every pay check. As a result, American company like google, nvidia, apple, gets floated like crazy. Meanwhile, stock traders are viewed as gamblers. Everyone knows someone who blown up their account. No one would trust their retirement in the market. The tremendous wealth of the people are literally in brick and mortar (housing). In fact, China has a deflation problem because people LOVE to save. Xi must have stumbled upon a freaking genius play. They see the opportunity to shift wealth and possibly rescue governments from debt by shifting wealth from real estate into stock market. You see, by allowing real estate to eventually go free fall as Chinese people capitulate and pile into stock market, China can solve multiple problem all at once. Government in debt? Probably already positioned into stock market very cheaply and now the people will transfer their wealth to bolster the government. Wanting to become more competitive in tech and brew local AI giants? Instead of having the masses put their piggy bank literally in the wall, you are now mentally training them to pile money into home grown company every month like Americans with their 401k. Housing market collapse? Let it go. You are dumb if you failed to unload grossly overpriced real estate. You see, the situation here, is that all this doesn’t depend on the west. This is a genius play to solve the housing crisis by rag pulling the Chinese boomers and liquidate their retirement funding in the form of realestate and create affordable housings all at once.

I don’t know about you, but I have zero second thoughts about putting money into SPY, VOO, etc every pay check. As a result, American company like google, nvidia, apple, gets floated like crazy. Meanwhile, stock traders are viewed as gamblers. Everyone knows someone who blown up their account. No one would trust their retirement in the market. The tremendous wealth of the people are literally in brick and mortar (housing). In fact, China has a deflation problem because people LOVE to save. Xi must have stumbled upon a freaking genius play. They see the opportunity to shift wealth and possibly rescue governments from debt by shifting wealth from real estate into stock market. You see, by allowing real estate to eventually go free fall as Chinese people capitulate and pile into stock market, China can solve multiple problem all at once. Government in debt? Probably already positioned into stock market very cheaply and now the people will transfer their wealth to bolster the government. Wanting to become more competitive in tech and brew local AI giants? Instead of having the masses put their piggy bank literally in the wall, you are now mentally training them to pile money into home grown company every month like Americans with their 401k. Housing market collapse? Let it go. You are dumb if you failed to unload grossly overpriced real estate. You see, the situation here, is that all this doesn’t depend on the west. This is a genius play to solve the housing crisis by rag pulling the Chinese boomers and liquidate their retirement funding in the form of realestate and create affordable housings all at once. The ghost towns will still be there but because housing will be allowed to drop it wont matter since the new focus will be to protect the stock market. At the same time this solve the local government debt crisis because they would have gone into stock market ahead of time. The people who are hurt the most are boomers sitting on millions of unrealized gain from housing. At the same time this would also help their companies to be more competitive as tremendous amount of wealth are raised for them to pile into chips and AI. The end result would be a stock market that is persistently rising and generate long term wealth similar to the US one. There will be one day where people literally put money into Chinese stock every month. The west knows this and if US dislike China as much as I think, the institutions will try their hardest to short and crash the Chinese market. It’ll be an epic battle of bulls and bears. The west know that if it can destroy confidence in the Chinese market while housing market is collapsing, it will absolutely eviscerate China. Xi knows this too, and he will use the might of an entire nation to defend the market and kill the shorts. I am not a finance professional and this is not financial advice. Chinese market is incredibly volatile and do so at your own risk. My belief is that it’s best to leverage a small principal into the Chinese market because potential of losses is extreme but gain is extreme as well. Therefore almost all my position is in YINN which is 3x bull. To tell you how the west think about China, Yinn is considered to be a low energy state where as YANG represents the sun and rising energy. Of course on the American market Yang is the short ticker. The best part about this whole situation is that since this is an internal wealth transfer, I don’t even think they depend on the west for this to work (they are robbing their own boomers).

,"My position is above. TL:DR: China is about to rag pull housing to direct majority of wealth into the stock market (similar to the US).
