,"Made a few bad calls on shit stocks including one where I took on about 2000$ in marginal debt at 13%. I see no future in a recovery. How should I go about paying it off? I have about 200$ liquid. I’m thinking I sell my NVIDIA shares to make up for it. Do we see a future where NVIDIA makes 1000%+ gains again? I think we’ve reached near the top around the 150$ price mark. I would rather hold onto my Tesla, Apple, Palantir shares.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999,0.5,0.999
