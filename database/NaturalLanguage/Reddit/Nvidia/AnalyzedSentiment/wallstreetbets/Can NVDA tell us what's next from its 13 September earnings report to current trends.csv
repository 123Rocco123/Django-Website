,"In the two months since Nvidia broke through to new highs to become the company with the highest market capitalisation, the semiconductor giant will report its third-quarter earnings on November 20 while continuing to expand its dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) market.Nvidia has risen a staggering 203 per cent so far this year, and most recently added another 7 per cent, with its shares rising to $143, while Nvidia's shares are now up 7 per cent. I remain optimistic about Nvidia's upcoming Q3 2025 earnings report. Nvidia's revenues are expected to reach $32.5 billion or more!

Oppenheimer's Rich Schafer raised his price target to $175. Meanwhile, Raymond James' Srini Pajjuri lowered his price target to $170, but said any drop in Nvidia's stock should be viewed as a buying opportunity.
