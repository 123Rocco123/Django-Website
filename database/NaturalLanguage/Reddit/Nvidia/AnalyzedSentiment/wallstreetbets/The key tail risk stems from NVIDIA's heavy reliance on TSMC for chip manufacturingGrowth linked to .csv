,"Nvidia's supply Chain ! Rev: 10.11%"" and COGS: 35.82% = Revenue Exposure: This indicates that 10.11% of NVIDIA's revenue is dependent on its relationship with TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company). In simpler terms, 10.11% of NVIDIA's revenue relies on products or services that come directly from TSMC as a supplier. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) Exposure: This means that 35.82% of NVIDIA's cost of goods sold** (i.e., the cost it incurs to produce its products) is tied to TSMC. TSMC manufactures NVIDIA's chips, which are essential for NVIDIA’s GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) and other products. Since TSMC supplies these critical components, over one-third of NVIDIA's production costs go directly to TSMC.
