CEO of the year!!,AMD has a stranglehold on the home videogame console market. The big problem is the question of whether or not the switch and the steam deck are the beginning of an industry shift away from home consoles. That market is substantially more competitive. Microsoft looks as if it is losing interest in producing traditional consoles. It's murky at best.,1,0.546,NEGATIVE,1.0

,My calls don't expire until April 2025 (nvda) and Jan 2026(AMD)....but I am sure my account will expire way sooner. Shout-out to Dr. Lisa Su. CEO of the year!!,"New type of consoles still use AMD chips, like SteamDeck. The problem is not the volumn of the console market - it is huge, it's the ""Semi-Custom Solutions"" buisness model that makes AMD take very little profit even with high volumn shipment.To win orders from SONY and Microsoft, AMD adopts a buyout OEM model to meet console vendors' requirement technically and financially, this model severely limits the profit margin, yet requires AMD to invest certain amount of resources and put them on high priority.We can not blame this model, volumn counts for semiconductor busiess, not to mention that had saved AMD at the hardest time. The silver lining is that AMD now making active moves to maximize gain from this model - there will be no flagship AIC gaming GPU of RX 8000 series in the coming year, what we will have is a middle class GPU with new RDNA 4 arch, I believe it's a variant from console GPU design, also this does not force AMD to use the bleeding edge process node of TSMC, that would save a lot of money and gamers can afford to a decent gaming card, it would be a win-win solution, we've seen such a strategy works many times in history of AMD GPUs - Radeon 7500, Radeon 9550, Radeon HD4800, Radeon RX580, these are well-known ""sweet spot"" graphics card for gamers.",2,0.557,NEGATIVE,1.0
