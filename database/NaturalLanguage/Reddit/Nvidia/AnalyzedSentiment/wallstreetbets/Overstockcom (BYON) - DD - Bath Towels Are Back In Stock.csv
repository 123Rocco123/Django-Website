,"**ATTENTION MODS AND HONOURABLE REPORT POLICE OF NEW: This DD and the company it covers is in no way related to the bankrupt legacy towel stock (RIP bagholders). This company was Overstock.com and has rebranded itself. Bath towels are back, and they're better than ever before. Alright, listen up, you’re only going to hear this once, and you’re only going to hear it from me, as no one else seems to be paying attention. I’ve been watching this company for YEARS waiting for the perfect moment to get in, and that moment is right now. Actually, it was last week on the day the last vestiges of peace Jared Kushner bestowed upon the Middle East finally evaporated. While simultaneously, the dock workers decided they were going to try to strongarm JPow into spinning up his money printer exclusively for their use --to fund their righteous battle against our future robot overlords. That day the stock hit a low of $8.91. The bottom is in. About the Company: Overstock.com has been around a very long time, since 1999, but basically all you need to know about that is that they started out doing the thing their name suggests. Then they switched it up and started selling a more standard lineup of home goods. Their name just didn't reflect what they did anymore. In 2023, the former crowd favorite’s bath towel retailer went tits up, and the CEO of Overstock at the time saw a golden opportunity. They snapped up the IP of ye old towel stock, along with the name, customer data, etc.. They rebranded the company to Beyond Inc., switched their website UI’s color scheme from red to blue, and slapped the old towel company’s name on it. (From here on I’ll refer to the forbidden name as triple-B, or 3B for short.) But somehow it wasn't an instant success... Overstock's original customers were left out in the cold, and the returning bath towel customers didn't like their product lineup. Things kept on declining. Enter Marcus Lemonis: He currently serves as the chairman and CEO of Camping World, a multi-billion dollar giant. He’s an activist investor specializing in turning around struggling businesses, and was key in building Camping World into what it is today. In Late 2023 he purchased a stake in Beyond and joined the board. He laid out plans to turn the business around, bring back Overstock.com, and promised results by the end of 2024. Well...things took longer than expected, including the relaunch of the Overstock.com website. So this is what happened: Now the stock is in the gutter, but the vision Lemonis has for the company is finally starting to come together. If you only care about earnings reports and staring at charts you might look at those and say to me: “Mr. Jimbles, you’re highly regarded. The revenue, EPS, and every other metric is worse YoY. The stock has been red every month for the past 6. This stock is going back to all-time lows, and likely, to zero.” And to which I will respond: “Why yes, thank you. I am highly regarded. You have an incredible talent for numbers and analysis. Slap an F rating on the stock, and go apply for a job at Motley Fool. They’d love to have you. You’ll fit right in there.” But this what has happened very recently: In July 2024 the Overstock.com website relaunched to exist alongside the new 3B website, specializing again in liquidating surplus inventory.  The Zulily IP, customer data, etc. was purchased in March of this year. If you haven’t heard of Zulily, they were another successful online retailer that went under after suffering from poor management, losing focus, and poor customer service, but the website had a cult following for its unique and exclusive selection of fashion goods. Beyond Inc. hired some of Zulily’s former team, and are bringing back your mom’s favorite fashion brands. They just soft-launched the new website a few weeks ago, but haven’t made any official announcement yet. Zulily.com Three new strategic partnerships have been teased that will restore a physical retail presence to the 3B brand. Now you might be thinking to yourself that this is a bad move, but having a physical store makes a lot of sense for home goods. Last I checked, you can’t download a credenza, and some people like to make sure the drapes match the carpet in person. One of these partnerships will deal with the Overstock arm of the business and will give them access to increased inventory and infrastructure to move what they already have. They just announced a new global licensing program to expand business internationally. They sold off their company HQ offices for $55m. Their balance sheet is good. Almost zero debt and plenty of cash for their upcoming moves. But that isn’t it by a long-shot. Lemonis has a vision for the Beyond umbrella to expand and include a whole slew of home related products and services including mortgages, home insurance, HELOCs, consumer credit cards, etc.. They plan to leverage the customer data gained from the retail businesses to onboard their existing customers for these other products in a frictionless, low cost way. And even though this pivot is finally taking shape now, none of it has been priced in. It may have been last fall based solely on hype when Lemonis joined the board, when the stock hit almost $40, but it definitely isn’t as of right now. Lucky me. Maybe some other charts and light TA will convince you though. What we have right here is RSI divergence on the weekly chart. The stock price is marching down, making lower lows, while RSI is trending up, making higher lows. Titillating, I know. You like Bollinger Bands??? Well here you go: On the daily, it’s consolidated, and the bands are tight enough to turn your wife’s boyfriend into a two pump chump. You can see it bounced hard off the bottom band in the past few days. Look at what happened last Friday when the dock workers settled for an insulting 62% raise and a guarantee that efficiency would not get in the way of union boss salaries: So what makes me sooooo smart and special? Nothing. I just happen to be in the right place at the right time. Like I said, I’ve been watching this stock/company for years as a matter of personal interest. This is the inflection point. No one cares about this stock and most people still think the 3B brand no longer exists at all. Analysts are asleep at the wheel, relying on ChatGPT to do their work for them, and GPT doesn’t know how to spoof an email and listen to a webcast yet. Here’s the webcast featuring Lemonis that took place on Sept. 10: https://investors.beyond.com/news-events/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2024/Piper-Sandler-Growth-Frontiers-Conference/default.aspx  Listen to it…or don’t. I don’t care. Lemonis goes into much more detail about the upcoming partnerships that will be announced at the investor conference happening on the day of earnings, as well as his vision for the company going forward. And he explains it all much better than some random regard on reddit ever could. He also takes ownership for the past mistakes that got us to where we are now. If you still aren’t convinced, cool. Go buy calls into NVIDIA earnings and enjoy crying in your wife’s boyfriend’s arms for a few days just like last time. Or buy the top on that incredible space stock after it’s up 20x in less than 6 months, get rug-pulled with a $400m share offering, and get rekt by the news drought. Or go do what Nana would want --buying deep ITMs in her meme stock... at least she might be proud of you. So what do I expect with the BYON stock? Short/medium term: Up. Long term: Really up. It looks good long term as everything spins up and the company transitions over the course of the next year. I don’t think analysts have accounted for the $177m run rate the newly relaunched Overstock website has hit since it went live at the beginning of Q3, or the fact that Zulily has been online for weeks already. Earnings will likely hit or exceed expectations, and even if it doesn’t, the partnerships being unveiled at the investor meeting and forward guidance will be impressive. There will likely be a runup even before earnings. When this stock moves, it MOVES. Here are my current positions as of writing this, but I'm not done buying yet...not even close. A YOLO update will follow after I've finished. Positions: Shotgun approach. Who knows when this thing will make its biggest moves. The random smattering of strikes may make you think I'm even more regarded than before, but liquidity is extremely thin and there were hot deals on different strikes at different times. **Tips if you feel this is a play you want to make and realize that if you just buy shares you're throwing your future gains in the trash: Liquidity on most option strikes/expiries is THIN, especially on the OTMs. Wait. wait. wait. You're thinking you'll just avoid all this by buying ITM/NTM? On a stock this undervalued?? Go back to where you belong. You know...that special sub where their best and only advice is DCA'ing into SPY. I recommend doing limits or 1 lot market orders b/c you might even get a few better fills that way. If you do big market orders you’re gonna get cucked on the way in and on the way out… if you make it that far. If you don’t know what the word slippage means...good luck. **Hint** It doesn't have anything to do with what happens to your wife while watching you unbutton her boyfriend's sport-coat.

One of these partnerships will deal with the Overstock arm of the business and will give them access to increased inventory and infrastructure to move what they already have. They just announced a new global licensing program to expand business internationally. They sold off their company HQ offices for $55m. Their balance sheet is good. Almost zero debt and plenty of cash for their upcoming moves. But that isn’t it by a long-shot. Lemonis has a vision for the Beyond umbrella to expand and include a whole slew of home related products and services including mortgages, home insurance, HELOCs, consumer credit cards, etc.. They plan to leverage the customer data gained from the retail businesses to onboard their existing customers for these other products in a frictionless, low cost way. And even though this pivot is finally taking shape now, none of it has been priced in. It may have been last fall based solely on hype when Lemonis joined the board, when the stock hit almost $40, but it definitely isn’t as of right now. Lucky me. Maybe some other charts and light TA will convince you though. What we have right here is RSI divergence on the weekly chart. The stock price is marching down, making lower lows, while RSI is trending up, making higher lows. Titillating, I know. You like Bollinger Bands??? Well here you go: On the daily, it’s consolidated, and the bands are tight enough to turn your wife’s boyfriend into a two pump chump. You can see it bounced hard off the bottom band in the past few days. Look at what happened last Friday when the dock workers settled for an insulting 62% raise and a guarantee that efficiency would not get in the way of union boss salaries: So what makes me sooooo smart and special? Nothing. I just happen to be in the right place at the right time. Like I said, I’ve been watching this stock/company for years as a matter of personal interest. This is the inflection point. No one cares about this stock and most people still think the 3B brand no longer exists at all. Analysts are asleep at the wheel, relying on ChatGPT to do their work for them, and GPT doesn’t know how to spoof an email and listen to a webcast yet. Here’s the webcast featuring Lemonis that took place on Sept. 10: https://investors.beyond.com/news-events/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2024/Piper-Sandler-Growth-Frontiers-Conference/default.aspx  Listen to it…or don’t. I don’t care. Lemonis goes into much more detail about the upcoming partnerships that will be announced at the investor conference happening on the day of earnings, as well as his vision for the company going forward. And he explains it all much better than some random regard on reddit ever could. He also takes ownership for the past mistakes that got us to where we are now. If you still aren’t convinced, cool. Go buy calls into NVIDIA earnings and enjoy crying in your wife’s boyfriend’s arms for a few days just like last time.

Or go do what Nana would want --buying deep ITMs in her meme stock... at least she might be proud of you. So what do I expect with the BYON stock? Short/medium term: Up. Long term: Really up. It looks good long term as everything spins up and the company transitions over the course of the next year. I don’t think analysts have accounted for the $177m run rate the newly relaunched Overstock website has hit since it went live at the beginning of Q3, or the fact that Zulily has been online for weeks already. Earnings will likely hit or exceed expectations, and even if it doesn’t, the partnerships being unveiled at the investor meeting and forward guidance will be impressive. There will likely be a runup even before earnings. When this stock moves, it MOVES. Here are my current positions as of writing this, but I'm not done buying yet...not even close.

,"**ATTENTION MODS AND HONOURABLE REPORT POLICE OF NEW: This DD and the company it covers is in no way related to the bankrupt legacy towel stock (RIP bagholders). This company was Overstock.com and has rebranded itself. Bath towels are back, and they're better than ever before. Alright, listen up, you’re only going to hear this once, and you’re only going to hear it from me, as no one else seems to be paying attention. I’ve been watching this company for YEARS waiting for the perfect moment to get in, and that moment is right now. Actually, it was last week on the day the last vestiges of peace Jared Kushner bestowed upon the Middle East finally evaporated. While simultaneously, the dock workers decided they were going to try to strongarm JPow into spinning up his money printer exclusively for their use --to fund their righteous battle against our future robot overlords. That day the stock hit a low of $8.91. The bottom is in. About the Company: Overstock.com has been around a very long time, since 1999, but basically all you need to know about that is that they started out doing the thing their name suggests. Then they switched it up and started selling a more standard lineup of home goods. Their name just didn't reflect what they did anymore. In 2023, the former crowd favorite’s bath towel retailer went tits up, and the CEO of Overstock at the time saw a golden opportunity. They snapped up the IP of ye old towel stock, along with the name, customer data, etc.. They rebranded the company to Beyond Inc., switched their website UI’s color scheme from red to blue, and slapped the old towel company’s name on it. (From here on I’ll refer to the forbidden name as triple-B, or 3B for short.) But somehow it wasn't an instant success... Overstock's original customers were left out in the cold, and the returning bath towel customers didn't like their product lineup. Things kept on declining. Enter Marcus Lemonis: He currently serves as the chairman and CEO of Camping World, a multi-billion dollar giant. He’s an activist investor specializing in turning around struggling businesses, and was key in building Camping World into what it is today. In Late 2023 he purchased a stake in Beyond and joined the board. He laid out plans to turn the business around, bring back Overstock.com, and promised results by the end of 2024. Well...things took longer than expected, including the relaunch of the Overstock.com website. So this is what happened: Now the stock is in the gutter, but the vision Lemonis has for the company is finally starting to come together. If you only care about earnings reports and staring at charts you might look at those and say to me: “Mr. Jimbles, you’re highly regarded. The revenue, EPS, and every other metric is worse YoY. The stock has been red every month for the past 6. This stock is going back to all-time lows, and likely, to zero.” And to which I will respond: “Why yes, thank you. I am highly regarded. You have an incredible talent for numbers and analysis. Slap an F rating on the stock, and go apply for a job at Motley Fool. They’d love to have you. You’ll fit right in there.” But this what has happened very recently: In July 2024 the Overstock.com website relaunched to exist alongside the new 3B website, specializing again in liquidating surplus inventory.  The Zulily IP, customer data, etc. was purchased in March of this year. If you haven’t heard of Zulily, they were another successful online retailer that went under after suffering from poor management, losing focus, and poor customer service, but the website had a cult following for its unique and exclusive selection of fashion goods. Beyond Inc. hired some of Zulily’s former team, and are bringing back your mom’s favorite fashion brands. They just soft-launched the new website a few weeks ago, but haven’t made any official announcement yet. Zulily.com Three new strategic partnerships have been teased that will restore a physical retail presence to the 3B brand. Now you might be thinking to yourself that this is a bad move, but having a physical store makes a lot of sense for home goods. Last I checked, you can’t download a credenza, and some people like to make sure the drapes match the carpet in person.

Earnings will likely hit or exceed expectations, and even if it doesn’t, the partnerships being unveiled at the investor meeting and forward guidance will be impressive. There will likely be a runup even before earnings. When this stock moves, it MOVES. Here are my current positions as of writing this, but I'm not done buying yet...not even close. A YOLO update will follow after I've finished. Positions: Shotgun approach. Who knows when this thing will make its biggest moves.

,"**ATTENTION MODS AND HONOURABLE REPORT POLICE OF NEW: This DD and the company it covers is in no way related to the bankrupt legacy towel stock (RIP bagholders). This company was Overstock.com and has rebranded itself. Bath towels are back, and they're better than ever before. Alright, listen up, you’re only going to hear this once, and you’re only going to hear it from me, as no one else seems to be paying attention. I’ve been watching this company for YEARS waiting for the perfect moment to get in, and that moment is right now. Actually, it was last week on the day the last vestiges of peace Jared Kushner bestowed upon the Middle East finally evaporated. While simultaneously, the dock workers decided they were going to try to strongarm JPow into spinning up his money printer exclusively for their use --to fund their righteous battle against our future robot overlords. That day the stock hit a low of $8.91. The bottom is in. About the Company: Overstock.com has been around a very long time, since 1999, but basically all you need to know about that is that they started out doing the thing their name suggests. Then they switched it up and started selling a more standard lineup of home goods. Their name just didn't reflect what they did anymore. In 2023, the former crowd favorite’s bath towel retailer went tits up, and the CEO of Overstock at the time saw a golden opportunity. They snapped up the IP of ye old towel stock, along with the name, customer data, etc.. They rebranded the company to Beyond Inc., switched their website UI’s color scheme from red to blue, and slapped the old towel company’s name on it. (From here on I’ll refer to the forbidden name as triple-B, or 3B for short.) But somehow it wasn't an instant success... Overstock's original customers were left out in the cold, and the returning bath towel customers didn't like their product lineup. Things kept on declining. Enter Marcus Lemonis: He currently serves as the chairman and CEO of Camping World, a multi-billion dollar giant. He’s an activist investor specializing in turning around struggling businesses, and was key in building Camping World into what it is today. In Late 2023 he purchased a stake in Beyond and joined the board. He laid out plans to turn the business around, bring back Overstock.com, and promised results by the end of 2024. Well...things took longer than expected, including the relaunch of the Overstock.com website. So this is what happened: Now the stock is in the gutter, but the vision Lemonis has for the company is finally starting to come together. If you only care about earnings reports and staring at charts you might look at those and say to me: “Mr. Jimbles, you’re highly regarded. The revenue, EPS, and every other metric is worse YoY. The stock has been red every month for the past 6. This stock is going back to all-time lows, and likely, to zero.” And to which I will respond: “Why yes, thank you. I am highly regarded. You have an incredible talent for numbers and analysis. Slap an F rating on the stock, and go apply for a job at Motley Fool. They’d love to have you. You’ll fit right in there.” But this what has happened very recently: In July 2024 the Overstock.com website relaunched to exist alongside the new 3B website, specializing again in liquidating surplus inventory.  The Zulily IP, customer data, etc. was purchased in March of this year. If you haven’t heard of Zulily, they were another successful online retailer that went under after suffering from poor management, losing focus, and poor customer service, but the website had a cult following for its unique and exclusive selection of fashion goods. Beyond Inc. hired some of Zulily’s former team, and are bringing back your mom’s favorite fashion brands. They just soft-launched the new website a few weeks ago, but haven’t made any official announcement yet. Zulily.com Three new strategic partnerships have been teased that will restore a physical retail presence to the 3B brand. Now you might be thinking to yourself that this is a bad move, but having a physical store makes a lot of sense for home goods. Last I checked, you can’t download a credenza, and some people like to make sure the drapes match the carpet in person. One of these partnerships will deal with the Overstock arm of the business and will give them access to increased inventory and infrastructure to move what they already have. They just announced a new global licensing program to expand business internationally. They sold off their company HQ offices for $55m. Their balance sheet is good. Almost zero debt and plenty of cash for their upcoming moves. But that isn’t it by a long-shot. Lemonis has a vision for the Beyond umbrella to expand and include a whole slew of home related products and services including mortgages, home insurance, HELOCs, consumer credit cards, etc.. They plan to leverage the customer data gained from the retail businesses to onboard their existing customers for these other products in a frictionless, low cost way. And even though this pivot is finally taking shape now, none of it has been priced in. It may have been last fall based solely on hype when Lemonis joined the board, when the stock hit almost $40, but it definitely isn’t as of right now. Lucky me. Maybe some other charts and light TA will convince you though. What we have right here is RSI divergence on the weekly chart. The stock price is marching down, making lower lows, while RSI is trending up, making higher lows. Titillating, I know. You like Bollinger Bands??? Well here you go: On the daily, it’s consolidated, and the bands are tight enough to turn your wife’s boyfriend into a two pump chump. You can see it bounced hard off the bottom band in the past few days. Look at what happened last Friday when the dock workers settled for an insulting 62% raise and a guarantee that efficiency would not get in the way of union boss salaries: So what makes me sooooo smart and special? Nothing. I just happen to be in the right place at the right time. Like I said, I’ve been watching this stock/company for years as a matter of personal interest. This is the inflection point. No one cares about this stock and most people still think the 3B brand no longer exists at all. Analysts are asleep at the wheel, relying on ChatGPT to do their work for them, and GPT doesn’t know how to spoof an email and listen to a webcast yet. Here’s the webcast featuring Lemonis that took place on Sept. 10: https://investors.beyond.com/news-events/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2024/Piper-Sandler-Growth-Frontiers-Conference/default.aspx  Listen to it…or don’t. I don’t care. Lemonis goes into much more detail about the upcoming partnerships that will be announced at the investor conference happening on the day of earnings, as well as his vision for the company going forward. And he explains it all much better than some random regard on reddit ever could. He also takes ownership for the past mistakes that got us to where we are now. If you still aren’t convinced, cool. Go buy calls into NVIDIA earnings and enjoy crying in your wife’s boyfriend’s arms for a few days just like last time. Or buy the top on that incredible space stock after it’s up 20x in less than 6 months, get rug-pulled with a $400m share offering, and get rekt by the news drought. Or go do what Nana would want --buying deep ITMs in her meme stock... at least she might be proud of you. So what do I expect with the BYON stock? Short/medium term: Up. Long term: Really up. It looks good long term as everything spins up and the company transitions over the course of the next year. I don’t think analysts have accounted for the $177m run rate the newly relaunched Overstock website has hit since it went live at the beginning of Q3, or the fact that Zulily has been online for weeks already.

Enter Marcus Lemonis: He currently serves as the chairman and CEO of Camping World, a multi-billion dollar giant. He’s an activist investor specializing in turning around struggling businesses, and was key in building Camping World into what it is today. In Late 2023 he purchased a stake in Beyond and joined the board. He laid out plans to turn the business around, bring back Overstock.com, and promised results by the end of 2024. Well...things took longer than expected, including the relaunch of the Overstock.com website. So this is what happened: Now the stock is in the gutter, but the vision Lemonis has for the company is finally starting to come together. If you only care about earnings reports and staring at charts you might look at those and say to me: “Mr. Jimbles, you’re highly regarded. The revenue, EPS, and every other metric is worse YoY. The stock has been red every month for the past 6. This stock is going back to all-time lows, and likely, to zero.” And to which I will respond: “Why yes, thank you. I am highly regarded. You have an incredible talent for numbers and analysis. Slap an F rating on the stock, and go apply for a job at Motley Fool. They’d love to have you. You’ll fit right in there.” But this what has happened very recently: In July 2024 the Overstock.com website relaunched to exist alongside the new 3B website, specializing again in liquidating surplus inventory.  The Zulily IP, customer data, etc. was purchased in March of this year. If you haven’t heard of Zulily, they were another successful online retailer that went under after suffering from poor management, losing focus, and poor customer service, but the website had a cult following for its unique and exclusive selection of fashion goods. Beyond Inc. hired some of Zulily’s former team, and are bringing back your mom’s favorite fashion brands. They just soft-launched the new website a few weeks ago, but haven’t made any official announcement yet. Zulily.com Three new strategic partnerships have been teased that will restore a physical retail presence to the 3B brand. Now you might be thinking to yourself that this is a bad move, but having a physical store makes a lot of sense for home goods. Last I checked, you can’t download a credenza, and some people like to make sure the drapes match the carpet in person. One of these partnerships will deal with the Overstock arm of the business and will give them access to increased inventory and infrastructure to move what they already have. They just announced a new global licensing program to expand business internationally. They sold off their company HQ offices for $55m. Their balance sheet is good. Almost zero debt and plenty of cash for their upcoming moves. But that isn’t it by a long-shot. Lemonis has a vision for the Beyond umbrella to expand and include a whole slew of home related products and services including mortgages, home insurance, HELOCs, consumer credit cards, etc.. They plan to leverage the customer data gained from the retail businesses to onboard their existing customers for these other products in a frictionless, low cost way. And even though this pivot is finally taking shape now, none of it has been priced in. It may have been last fall based solely on hype when Lemonis joined the board, when the stock hit almost $40, but it definitely isn’t as of right now. Lucky me. Maybe some other charts and light TA will convince you though. What we have right here is RSI divergence on the weekly chart. The stock price is marching down, making lower lows, while RSI is trending up, making higher lows. Titillating, I know. You like Bollinger Bands??? Well here you go: On the daily, it’s consolidated, and the bands are tight enough to turn your wife’s boyfriend into a two pump chump. You can see it bounced hard off the bottom band in the past few days. Look at what happened last Friday when the dock workers settled for an insulting 62% raise and a guarantee that efficiency would not get in the way of union boss salaries: So what makes me sooooo smart and special? Nothing. I just happen to be in the right place at the right time. Like I said, I’ve been watching this stock/company for years as a matter of personal interest. This is the inflection point. No one cares about this stock and most people still think the 3B brand no longer exists at all. Analysts are asleep at the wheel, relying on ChatGPT to do their work for them, and GPT doesn’t know how to spoof an email and listen to a webcast yet. Here’s the webcast featuring Lemonis that took place on Sept. 10: https://investors.beyond.com/news-events/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2024/Piper-Sandler-Growth-Frontiers-Conference/default.aspx  Listen to it…or don’t. I don’t care. Lemonis goes into much more detail about the upcoming partnerships that will be announced at the investor conference happening on the day of earnings, as well as his vision for the company going forward. And he explains it all much better than some random regard on reddit ever could. He also takes ownership for the past mistakes that got us to where we are now. If you still aren’t convinced, cool. Go buy calls into NVIDIA earnings and enjoy crying in your wife’s boyfriend’s arms for a few days just like last time. Or buy the top on that incredible space stock after it’s up 20x in less than 6 months, get rug-pulled with a $400m share offering, and get rekt by the news drought. Or go do what Nana would want --buying deep ITMs in her meme stock... at least she might be proud of you. So what do I expect with the BYON stock? Short/medium term: Up. Long term: Really up. It looks good long term as everything spins up and the company transitions over the course of the next year. I don’t think analysts have accounted for the $177m run rate the newly relaunched Overstock website has hit since it went live at the beginning of Q3, or the fact that Zulily has been online for weeks already. Earnings will likely hit or exceed expectations, and even if it doesn’t, the partnerships being unveiled at the investor meeting and forward guidance will be impressive. There will likely be a runup even before earnings. When this stock moves, it MOVES. Here are my current positions as of writing this, but I'm not done buying yet...not even close. A YOLO update will follow after I've finished. Positions: Shotgun approach. Who knows when this thing will make its biggest moves. The random smattering of strikes may make you think I'm even more regarded than before, but liquidity is extremely thin and there were hot deals on different strikes at different times. **Tips if you feel this is a play you want to make and realize that if you just buy shares you're throwing your future gains in the trash: Liquidity on most option strikes/expiries is THIN, especially on the OTMs. Wait. wait. wait. You're thinking you'll just avoid all this by buying ITM/NTM? On a stock this undervalued?? Go back to where you belong.

This company was Overstock.com and has rebranded itself. Bath towels are back, and they're better than ever before. Alright, listen up, you’re only going to hear this once, and you’re only going to hear it from me, as no one else seems to be paying attention. I’ve been watching this company for YEARS waiting for the perfect moment to get in, and that moment is right now. Actually, it was last week on the day the last vestiges of peace Jared Kushner bestowed upon the Middle East finally evaporated.

That day the stock hit a low of $8.91. The bottom is in. About the Company: Overstock.com has been around a very long time, since 1999, but basically all you need to know about that is that they started out doing the thing their name suggests. Then they switched it up and started selling a more standard lineup of home goods. Their name just didn't reflect what they did anymore. In 2023, the former crowd favorite’s bath towel retailer went tits up, and the CEO of Overstock at the time saw a golden opportunity. They snapped up the IP of ye old towel stock, along with the name, customer data, etc.. They rebranded the company to Beyond Inc., switched their website UI’s color scheme from red to blue, and slapped the old towel company’s name on it.

I don’t care. Lemonis goes into much more detail about the upcoming partnerships that will be announced at the investor conference happening on the day of earnings, as well as his vision for the company going forward. And he explains it all much better than some random regard on reddit ever could. He also takes ownership for the past mistakes that got us to where we are now. If you still aren’t convinced, cool.

,"**ATTENTION MODS AND HONOURABLE REPORT POLICE OF NEW: This DD and the company it covers is in no way related to the bankrupt legacy towel stock (RIP bagholders). This company was Overstock.com and has rebranded itself. Bath towels are back, and they're better than ever before. Alright, listen up, you’re only going to hear this once, and you’re only going to hear it from me, as no one else seems to be paying attention. I’ve been watching this company for YEARS waiting for the perfect moment to get in, and that moment is right now. Actually, it was last week on the day the last vestiges of peace Jared Kushner bestowed upon the Middle East finally evaporated. While simultaneously, the dock workers decided they were going to try to strongarm JPow into spinning up his money printer exclusively for their use --to fund their righteous battle against our future robot overlords. That day the stock hit a low of $8.91. The bottom is in. About the Company: Overstock.com has been around a very long time, since 1999, but basically all you need to know about that is that they started out doing the thing their name suggests. Then they switched it up and started selling a more standard lineup of home goods. Their name just didn't reflect what they did anymore. In 2023, the former crowd favorite’s bath towel retailer went tits up, and the CEO of Overstock at the time saw a golden opportunity. They snapped up the IP of ye old towel stock, along with the name, customer data, etc.. They rebranded the company to Beyond Inc., switched their website UI’s color scheme from red to blue, and slapped the old towel company’s name on it. (From here on I’ll refer to the forbidden name as triple-B, or 3B for short.) But somehow it wasn't an instant success... Overstock's original customers were left out in the cold, and the returning bath towel customers didn't like their product lineup. Things kept on declining. Enter Marcus Lemonis: He currently serves as the chairman and CEO of Camping World, a multi-billion dollar giant. He’s an activist investor specializing in turning around struggling businesses, and was key in building Camping World into what it is today. In Late 2023 he purchased a stake in Beyond and joined the board. He laid out plans to turn the business around, bring back Overstock.com, and promised results by the end of 2024. Well...things took longer than expected, including the relaunch of the Overstock.com website. So this is what happened: Now the stock is in the gutter, but the vision Lemonis has for the company is finally starting to come together. If you only care about earnings reports and staring at charts you might look at those and say to me: “Mr. Jimbles, you’re highly regarded. The revenue, EPS, and every other metric is worse YoY. The stock has been red every month for the past 6. This stock is going back to all-time lows, and likely, to zero.” And to which I will respond: “Why yes, thank you. I am highly regarded. You have an incredible talent for numbers and analysis. Slap an F rating on the stock, and go apply for a job at Motley Fool. They’d love to have you. You’ll fit right in there.” But this what has happened very recently: In July 2024 the Overstock.com website relaunched to exist alongside the new 3B website, specializing again in liquidating surplus inventory.  The Zulily IP, customer data, etc. was purchased in March of this year. If you haven’t heard of Zulily, they were another successful online retailer that went under after suffering from poor management, losing focus, and poor customer service, but the website had a cult following for its unique and exclusive selection of fashion goods. Beyond Inc. hired some of Zulily’s former team, and are bringing back your mom’s favorite fashion brands. They just soft-launched the new website a few weeks ago, but haven’t made any official announcement yet. Zulily.com Three new strategic partnerships have been teased that will restore a physical retail presence to the 3B brand. Now you might be thinking to yourself that this is a bad move, but having a physical store makes a lot of sense for home goods. Last I checked, you can’t download a credenza, and some people like to make sure the drapes match the carpet in person. One of these partnerships will deal with the Overstock arm of the business and will give them access to increased inventory and infrastructure to move what they already have. They just announced a new global licensing program to expand business internationally. They sold off their company HQ offices for $55m. Their balance sheet is good. Almost zero debt and plenty of cash for their upcoming moves. But that isn’t it by a long-shot. Lemonis has a vision for the Beyond umbrella to expand and include a whole slew of home related products and services including mortgages, home insurance, HELOCs, consumer credit cards, etc.. They plan to leverage the customer data gained from the retail businesses to onboard their existing customers for these other products in a frictionless, low cost way. And even though this pivot is finally taking shape now, none of it has been priced in. It may have been last fall based solely on hype when Lemonis joined the board, when the stock hit almost $40, but it definitely isn’t as of right now. Lucky me. Maybe some other charts and light TA will convince you though. What we have right here is RSI divergence on the weekly chart. The stock price is marching down, making lower lows, while RSI is trending up, making higher lows. Titillating, I know. You like Bollinger Bands??? Well here you go: On the daily, it’s consolidated, and the bands are tight enough to turn your wife’s boyfriend into a two pump chump.

,"**ATTENTION MODS AND HONOURABLE REPORT POLICE OF NEW: This DD and the company it covers is in no way related to the bankrupt legacy towel stock (RIP bagholders). This company was Overstock.com and has rebranded itself. Bath towels are back, and they're better than ever before. Alright, listen up, you’re only going to hear this once, and you’re only going to hear it from me, as no one else seems to be paying attention. I’ve been watching this company for YEARS waiting for the perfect moment to get in, and that moment is right now. Actually, it was last week on the day the last vestiges of peace Jared Kushner bestowed upon the Middle East finally evaporated. While simultaneously, the dock workers decided they were going to try to strongarm JPow into spinning up his money printer exclusively for their use --to fund their righteous battle against our future robot overlords. That day the stock hit a low of $8.91. The bottom is in. About the Company: Overstock.com has been around a very long time, since 1999, but basically all you need to know about that is that they started out doing the thing their name suggests. Then they switched it up and started selling a more standard lineup of home goods. Their name just didn't reflect what they did anymore. In 2023, the former crowd favorite’s bath towel retailer went tits up, and the CEO of Overstock at the time saw a golden opportunity. They snapped up the IP of ye old towel stock, along with the name, customer data, etc.. They rebranded the company to Beyond Inc., switched their website UI’s color scheme from red to blue, and slapped the old towel company’s name on it. (From here on I’ll refer to the forbidden name as triple-B, or 3B for short.) But somehow it wasn't an instant success... Overstock's original customers were left out in the cold, and the returning bath towel customers didn't like their product lineup. Things kept on declining. Enter Marcus Lemonis: He currently serves as the chairman and CEO of Camping World, a multi-billion dollar giant. He’s an activist investor specializing in turning around struggling businesses, and was key in building Camping World into what it is today. In Late 2023 he purchased a stake in Beyond and joined the board. He laid out plans to turn the business around, bring back Overstock.com, and promised results by the end of 2024. Well...things took longer than expected, including the relaunch of the Overstock.com website. So this is what happened: Now the stock is in the gutter, but the vision Lemonis has for the company is finally starting to come together. If you only care about earnings reports and staring at charts you might look at those and say to me: “Mr. Jimbles, you’re highly regarded. The revenue, EPS, and every other metric is worse YoY. The stock has been red every month for the past 6. This stock is going back to all-time lows, and likely, to zero.” And to which I will respond: “Why yes, thank you. I am highly regarded. You have an incredible talent for numbers and analysis. Slap an F rating on the stock, and go apply for a job at Motley Fool. They’d love to have you. You’ll fit right in there.” But this what has happened very recently: In July 2024 the Overstock.com website relaunched to exist alongside the new 3B website, specializing again in liquidating surplus inventory.  The Zulily IP, customer data, etc. was purchased in March of this year. If you haven’t heard of Zulily, they were another successful online retailer that went under after suffering from poor management, losing focus, and poor customer service, but the website had a cult following for its unique and exclusive selection of fashion goods. Beyond Inc. hired some of Zulily’s former team, and are bringing back your mom’s favorite fashion brands. They just soft-launched the new website a few weeks ago, but haven’t made any official announcement yet. Zulily.com Three new strategic partnerships have been teased that will restore a physical retail presence to the 3B brand. Now you might be thinking to yourself that this is a bad move, but having a physical store makes a lot of sense for home goods. Last I checked, you can’t download a credenza, and some people like to make sure the drapes match the carpet in person. One of these partnerships will deal with the Overstock arm of the business and will give them access to increased inventory and infrastructure to move what they already have. They just announced a new global licensing program to expand business internationally. They sold off their company HQ offices for $55m. Their balance sheet is good. Almost zero debt and plenty of cash for their upcoming moves. But that isn’t it by a long-shot. Lemonis has a vision for the Beyond umbrella to expand and include a whole slew of home related products and services including mortgages, home insurance, HELOCs, consumer credit cards, etc.. They plan to leverage the customer data gained from the retail businesses to onboard their existing customers for these other products in a frictionless, low cost way. And even though this pivot is finally taking shape now, none of it has been priced in. It may have been last fall based solely on hype when Lemonis joined the board, when the stock hit almost $40, but it definitely isn’t as of right now. Lucky me. Maybe some other charts and light TA will convince you though. What we have right here is RSI divergence on the weekly chart. The stock price is marching down, making lower lows, while RSI is trending up, making higher lows. Titillating, I know. You like Bollinger Bands??? Well here you go: On the daily, it’s consolidated, and the bands are tight enough to turn your wife’s boyfriend into a two pump chump. You can see it bounced hard off the bottom band in the past few days. Look at what happened last Friday when the dock workers settled for an insulting 62% raise and a guarantee that efficiency would not get in the way of union boss salaries: So what makes me sooooo smart and special? Nothing. I just happen to be in the right place at the right time. Like I said, I’ve been watching this stock/company for years as a matter of personal interest. This is the inflection point. No one cares about this stock and most people still think the 3B brand no longer exists at all. Analysts are asleep at the wheel, relying on ChatGPT to do their work for them, and GPT doesn’t know how to spoof an email and listen to a webcast yet. Here’s the webcast featuring Lemonis that took place on Sept. 10: https://investors.beyond.com/news-events/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2024/Piper-Sandler-Growth-Frontiers-Conference/default.aspx  Listen to it…or don’t. I don’t care. Lemonis goes into much more detail about the upcoming partnerships that will be announced at the investor conference happening on the day of earnings, as well as his vision for the company going forward. And he explains it all much better than some random regard on reddit ever could. He also takes ownership for the past mistakes that got us to where we are now. If you still aren’t convinced, cool. Go buy calls into NVIDIA earnings and enjoy crying in your wife’s boyfriend’s arms for a few days just like last time. Or buy the top on that incredible space stock after it’s up 20x in less than 6 months, get rug-pulled with a $400m share offering, and get rekt by the news drought. Or go do what Nana would want --buying deep ITMs in her meme stock... at least she might be proud of you. So what do I expect with the BYON stock? Short/medium term: Up. Long term: Really up. It looks good long term as everything spins up and the company transitions over the course of the next year. I don’t think analysts have accounted for the $177m run rate the newly relaunched Overstock website has hit since it went live at the beginning of Q3, or the fact that Zulily has been online for weeks already. Earnings will likely hit or exceed expectations, and even if it doesn’t, the partnerships being unveiled at the investor meeting and forward guidance will be impressive. There will likely be a runup even before earnings. When this stock moves, it MOVES. Here are my current positions as of writing this, but I'm not done buying yet...not even close. A YOLO update will follow after I've finished. Positions: Shotgun approach. Who knows when this thing will make its biggest moves. The random smattering of strikes may make you think I'm even more regarded than before, but liquidity is extremely thin and there were hot deals on different strikes at different times. **Tips if you feel this is a play you want to make and realize that if you just buy shares you're throwing your future gains in the trash: Liquidity on most option strikes/expiries is THIN, especially on the OTMs. Wait. wait. wait. You're thinking you'll just avoid all this by buying ITM/NTM? On a stock this undervalued?? Go back to where you belong. You know...that special sub where their best and only advice is DCA'ing into SPY. I recommend doing limits or 1 lot market orders b/c you might even get a few better fills that way. If you do big market orders you’re gonna get cucked on the way in and on the way out… if you make it that far.

Zulily.com Three new strategic partnerships have been teased that will restore a physical retail presence to the 3B brand. Now you might be thinking to yourself that this is a bad move, but having a physical store makes a lot of sense for home goods. Last I checked, you can’t download a credenza, and some people like to make sure the drapes match the carpet in person. One of these partnerships will deal with the Overstock arm of the business and will give them access to increased inventory and infrastructure to move what they already have. They just announced a new global licensing program to expand business internationally. They sold off their company HQ offices for $55m. Their balance sheet is good. Almost zero debt and plenty of cash for their upcoming moves. But that isn’t it by a long-shot. Lemonis has a vision for the Beyond umbrella to expand and include a whole slew of home related products and services including mortgages, home insurance, HELOCs, consumer credit cards, etc.. They plan to leverage the customer data gained from the retail businesses to onboard their existing customers for these other products in a frictionless, low cost way. And even though this pivot is finally taking shape now, none of it has been priced in. It may have been last fall based solely on hype when Lemonis joined the board, when the stock hit almost $40, but it definitely isn’t as of right now. Lucky me. Maybe some other charts and light TA will convince you though. What we have right here is RSI divergence on the weekly chart. The stock price is marching down, making lower lows, while RSI is trending up, making higher lows. Titillating, I know. You like Bollinger Bands??? Well here you go: On the daily, it’s consolidated, and the bands are tight enough to turn your wife’s boyfriend into a two pump chump. You can see it bounced hard off the bottom band in the past few days. Look at what happened last Friday when the dock workers settled for an insulting 62% raise and a guarantee that efficiency would not get in the way of union boss salaries: So what makes me sooooo smart and special? Nothing. I just happen to be in the right place at the right time. Like I said, I’ve been watching this stock/company for years as a matter of personal interest. This is the inflection point. No one cares about this stock and most people still think the 3B brand no longer exists at all. Analysts are asleep at the wheel, relying on ChatGPT to do their work for them, and GPT doesn’t know how to spoof an email and listen to a webcast yet. Here’s the webcast featuring Lemonis that took place on Sept. 10: https://investors.beyond.com/news-events/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2024/Piper-Sandler-Growth-Frontiers-Conference/default.aspx  Listen to it…or don’t. I don’t care. Lemonis goes into much more detail about the upcoming partnerships that will be announced at the investor conference happening on the day of earnings, as well as his vision for the company going forward. And he explains it all much better than some random regard on reddit ever could. He also takes ownership for the past mistakes that got us to where we are now. If you still aren’t convinced, cool. Go buy calls into NVIDIA earnings and enjoy crying in your wife’s boyfriend’s arms for a few days just like last time. Or buy the top on that incredible space stock after it’s up 20x in less than 6 months, get rug-pulled with a $400m share offering, and get rekt by the news drought. Or go do what Nana would want --buying deep ITMs in her meme stock... at least she might be proud of you. So what do I expect with the BYON stock? Short/medium term: Up. Long term: Really up. It looks good long term as everything spins up and the company transitions over the course of the next year. I don’t think analysts have accounted for the $177m run rate the newly relaunched Overstock website has hit since it went live at the beginning of Q3, or the fact that Zulily has been online for weeks already. Earnings will likely hit or exceed expectations, and even if it doesn’t, the partnerships being unveiled at the investor meeting and forward guidance will be impressive. There will likely be a runup even before earnings. When this stock moves, it MOVES. Here are my current positions as of writing this, but I'm not done buying yet...not even close. A YOLO update will follow after I've finished. Positions: Shotgun approach. Who knows when this thing will make its biggest moves. The random smattering of strikes may make you think I'm even more regarded than before, but liquidity is extremely thin and there were hot deals on different strikes at different times. **Tips if you feel this is a play you want to make and realize that if you just buy shares you're throwing your future gains in the trash: Liquidity on most option strikes/expiries is THIN, especially on the OTMs. Wait. wait. wait. You're thinking you'll just avoid all this by buying ITM/NTM? On a stock this undervalued?? Go back to where you belong. You know...that special sub where their best and only advice is DCA'ing into SPY. I recommend doing limits or 1 lot market orders b/c you might even get a few better fills that way. If you do big market orders you’re gonna get cucked on the way in and on the way out… if you make it that far.

,"**ATTENTION MODS AND HONOURABLE REPORT POLICE OF NEW: This DD and the company it covers is in no way related to the bankrupt legacy towel stock (RIP bagholders). This company was Overstock.com and has rebranded itself. Bath towels are back, and they're better than ever before. Alright, listen up, you’re only going to hear this once, and you’re only going to hear it from me, as no one else seems to be paying attention. I’ve been watching this company for YEARS waiting for the perfect moment to get in, and that moment is right now. Actually, it was last week on the day the last vestiges of peace Jared Kushner bestowed upon the Middle East finally evaporated. While simultaneously, the dock workers decided they were going to try to strongarm JPow into spinning up his money printer exclusively for their use --to fund their righteous battle against our future robot overlords. That day the stock hit a low of $8.91. The bottom is in. About the Company: Overstock.com has been around a very long time, since 1999, but basically all you need to know about that is that they started out doing the thing their name suggests. Then they switched it up and started selling a more standard lineup of home goods. Their name just didn't reflect what they did anymore. In 2023, the former crowd favorite’s bath towel retailer went tits up, and the CEO of Overstock at the time saw a golden opportunity. They snapped up the IP of ye old towel stock, along with the name, customer data, etc.. They rebranded the company to Beyond Inc., switched their website UI’s color scheme from red to blue, and slapped the old towel company’s name on it. (From here on I’ll refer to the forbidden name as triple-B, or 3B for short.) But somehow it wasn't an instant success... Overstock's original customers were left out in the cold, and the returning bath towel customers didn't like their product lineup. Things kept on declining. Enter Marcus Lemonis: He currently serves as the chairman and CEO of Camping World, a multi-billion dollar giant. He’s an activist investor specializing in turning around struggling businesses, and was key in building Camping World into what it is today. In Late 2023 he purchased a stake in Beyond and joined the board. He laid out plans to turn the business around, bring back Overstock.com, and promised results by the end of 2024. Well...things took longer than expected, including the relaunch of the Overstock.com website. So this is what happened: Now the stock is in the gutter, but the vision Lemonis has for the company is finally starting to come together. If you only care about earnings reports and staring at charts you might look at those and say to me: “Mr. Jimbles, you’re highly regarded. The revenue, EPS, and every other metric is worse YoY. The stock has been red every month for the past 6. This stock is going back to all-time lows, and likely, to zero.” And to which I will respond: “Why yes, thank you. I am highly regarded. You have an incredible talent for numbers and analysis. Slap an F rating on the stock, and go apply for a job at Motley Fool. They’d love to have you. You’ll fit right in there.” But this what has happened very recently: In July 2024 the Overstock.com website relaunched to exist alongside the new 3B website, specializing again in liquidating surplus inventory.  The Zulily IP, customer data, etc. was purchased in March of this year. If you haven’t heard of Zulily, they were another successful online retailer that went under after suffering from poor management, losing focus, and poor customer service, but the website had a cult following for its unique and exclusive selection of fashion goods. Beyond Inc. hired some of Zulily’s former team, and are bringing back your mom’s favorite fashion brands.

,"**ATTENTION MODS AND HONOURABLE REPORT POLICE OF NEW: This DD and the company it covers is in no way related to the bankrupt legacy towel stock (RIP bagholders). This company was Overstock.com and has rebranded itself. Bath towels are back, and they're better than ever before. Alright, listen up, you’re only going to hear this once, and you’re only going to hear it from me, as no one else seems to be paying attention. I’ve been watching this company for YEARS waiting for the perfect moment to get in, and that moment is right now. Actually, it was last week on the day the last vestiges of peace Jared Kushner bestowed upon the Middle East finally evaporated. While simultaneously, the dock workers decided they were going to try to strongarm JPow into spinning up his money printer exclusively for their use --to fund their righteous battle against our future robot overlords. That day the stock hit a low of $8.91. The bottom is in. About the Company: Overstock.com has been around a very long time, since 1999, but basically all you need to know about that is that they started out doing the thing their name suggests. Then they switched it up and started selling a more standard lineup of home goods. Their name just didn't reflect what they did anymore. In 2023, the former crowd favorite’s bath towel retailer went tits up, and the CEO of Overstock at the time saw a golden opportunity. They snapped up the IP of ye old towel stock, along with the name, customer data, etc.. They rebranded the company to Beyond Inc., switched their website UI’s color scheme from red to blue, and slapped the old towel company’s name on it. (From here on I’ll refer to the forbidden name as triple-B, or 3B for short.) But somehow it wasn't an instant success... Overstock's original customers were left out in the cold, and the returning bath towel customers didn't like their product lineup. Things kept on declining. Enter Marcus Lemonis: He currently serves as the chairman and CEO of Camping World, a multi-billion dollar giant. He’s an activist investor specializing in turning around struggling businesses, and was key in building Camping World into what it is today. In Late 2023 he purchased a stake in Beyond and joined the board. He laid out plans to turn the business around, bring back Overstock.com, and promised results by the end of 2024. Well...things took longer than expected, including the relaunch of the Overstock.com website. So this is what happened: Now the stock is in the gutter, but the vision Lemonis has for the company is finally starting to come together. If you only care about earnings reports and staring at charts you might look at those and say to me: “Mr. Jimbles, you’re highly regarded. The revenue, EPS, and every other metric is worse YoY. The stock has been red every month for the past 6. This stock is going back to all-time lows, and likely, to zero.” And to which I will respond: “Why yes, thank you. I am highly regarded. You have an incredible talent for numbers and analysis. Slap an F rating on the stock, and go apply for a job at Motley Fool. They’d love to have you. You’ll fit right in there.” But this what has happened very recently: In July 2024 the Overstock.com website relaunched to exist alongside the new 3B website, specializing again in liquidating surplus inventory.  The Zulily IP, customer data, etc. was purchased in March of this year. If you haven’t heard of Zulily, they were another successful online retailer that went under after suffering from poor management, losing focus, and poor customer service, but the website had a cult following for its unique and exclusive selection of fashion goods. Beyond Inc. hired some of Zulily’s former team, and are bringing back your mom’s favorite fashion brands. They just soft-launched the new website a few weeks ago, but haven’t made any official announcement yet. Zulily.com Three new strategic partnerships have been teased that will restore a physical retail presence to the 3B brand. Now you might be thinking to yourself that this is a bad move, but having a physical store makes a lot of sense for home goods. Last I checked, you can’t download a credenza, and some people like to make sure the drapes match the carpet in person. One of these partnerships will deal with the Overstock arm of the business and will give them access to increased inventory and infrastructure to move what they already have. They just announced a new global licensing program to expand business internationally. They sold off their company HQ offices for $55m. Their balance sheet is good. Almost zero debt and plenty of cash for their upcoming moves. But that isn’t it by a long-shot. Lemonis has a vision for the Beyond umbrella to expand and include a whole slew of home related products and services including mortgages, home insurance, HELOCs, consumer credit cards, etc.. They plan to leverage the customer data gained from the retail businesses to onboard their existing customers for these other products in a frictionless, low cost way. And even though this pivot is finally taking shape now, none of it has been priced in. It may have been last fall based solely on hype when Lemonis joined the board, when the stock hit almost $40, but it definitely isn’t as of right now. Lucky me. Maybe some other charts and light TA will convince you though. What we have right here is RSI divergence on the weekly chart. The stock price is marching down, making lower lows, while RSI is trending up, making higher lows. Titillating, I know. You like Bollinger Bands??? Well here you go: On the daily, it’s consolidated, and the bands are tight enough to turn your wife’s boyfriend into a two pump chump. You can see it bounced hard off the bottom band in the past few days. Look at what happened last Friday when the dock workers settled for an insulting 62% raise and a guarantee that efficiency would not get in the way of union boss salaries: So what makes me sooooo smart and special? Nothing. I just happen to be in the right place at the right time. Like I said, I’ve been watching this stock/company for years as a matter of personal interest. This is the inflection point. No one cares about this stock and most people still think the 3B brand no longer exists at all. Analysts are asleep at the wheel, relying on ChatGPT to do their work for them, and GPT doesn’t know how to spoof an email and listen to a webcast yet. Here’s the webcast featuring Lemonis that took place on Sept. 10: https://investors.beyond.com/news-events/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2024/Piper-Sandler-Growth-Frontiers-Conference/default.aspx  Listen to it…or don’t. I don’t care. Lemonis goes into much more detail about the upcoming partnerships that will be announced at the investor conference happening on the day of earnings, as well as his vision for the company going forward. And he explains it all much better than some random regard on reddit ever could. He also takes ownership for the past mistakes that got us to where we are now. If you still aren’t convinced, cool.

Or buy the top on that incredible space stock after it’s up 20x in less than 6 months, get rug-pulled with a $400m share offering, and get rekt by the news drought. Or go do what Nana would want --buying deep ITMs in her meme stock... at least she might be proud of you. So what do I expect with the BYON stock? Short/medium term: Up. Long term: Really up.

Enter Marcus Lemonis: He currently serves as the chairman and CEO of Camping World, a multi-billion dollar giant. He’s an activist investor specializing in turning around struggling businesses, and was key in building Camping World into what it is today. In Late 2023 he purchased a stake in Beyond and joined the board. He laid out plans to turn the business around, bring back Overstock.com, and promised results by the end of 2024. Well...things took longer than expected, including the relaunch of the Overstock.com website. So this is what happened: Now the stock is in the gutter, but the vision Lemonis has for the company is finally starting to come together. If you only care about earnings reports and staring at charts you might look at those and say to me: “Mr. Jimbles, you’re highly regarded. The revenue, EPS, and every other metric is worse YoY. The stock has been red every month for the past 6. This stock is going back to all-time lows, and likely, to zero.” And to which I will respond: “Why yes, thank you. I am highly regarded. You have an incredible talent for numbers and analysis. Slap an F rating on the stock, and go apply for a job at Motley Fool. They’d love to have you. You’ll fit right in there.” But this what has happened very recently: In July 2024 the Overstock.com website relaunched to exist alongside the new 3B website, specializing again in liquidating surplus inventory.  The Zulily IP, customer data, etc. was purchased in March of this year. If you haven’t heard of Zulily, they were another successful online retailer that went under after suffering from poor management, losing focus, and poor customer service, but the website had a cult following for its unique and exclusive selection of fashion goods. Beyond Inc. hired some of Zulily’s former team, and are bringing back your mom’s favorite fashion brands. They just soft-launched the new website a few weeks ago, but haven’t made any official announcement yet. Zulily.com Three new strategic partnerships have been teased that will restore a physical retail presence to the 3B brand. Now you might be thinking to yourself that this is a bad move, but having a physical store makes a lot of sense for home goods. Last I checked, you can’t download a credenza, and some people like to make sure the drapes match the carpet in person. One of these partnerships will deal with the Overstock arm of the business and will give them access to increased inventory and infrastructure to move what they already have. They just announced a new global licensing program to expand business internationally. They sold off their company HQ offices for $55m. Their balance sheet is good. Almost zero debt and plenty of cash for their upcoming moves. But that isn’t it by a long-shot. Lemonis has a vision for the Beyond umbrella to expand and include a whole slew of home related products and services including mortgages, home insurance, HELOCs, consumer credit cards, etc.. They plan to leverage the customer data gained from the retail businesses to onboard their existing customers for these other products in a frictionless, low cost way. And even though this pivot is finally taking shape now, none of it has been priced in. It may have been last fall based solely on hype when Lemonis joined the board, when the stock hit almost $40, but it definitely isn’t as of right now. Lucky me. Maybe some other charts and light TA will convince you though. What we have right here is RSI divergence on the weekly chart. The stock price is marching down, making lower lows, while RSI is trending up, making higher lows. Titillating, I know. You like Bollinger Bands??? Well here you go: On the daily, it’s consolidated, and the bands are tight enough to turn your wife’s boyfriend into a two pump chump. You can see it bounced hard off the bottom band in the past few days. Look at what happened last Friday when the dock workers settled for an insulting 62% raise and a guarantee that efficiency would not get in the way of union boss salaries: So what makes me sooooo smart and special? Nothing. I just happen to be in the right place at the right time. Like I said, I’ve been watching this stock/company for years as a matter of personal interest. This is the inflection point. No one cares about this stock and most people still think the 3B brand no longer exists at all. Analysts are asleep at the wheel, relying on ChatGPT to do their work for them, and GPT doesn’t know how to spoof an email and listen to a webcast yet. Here’s the webcast featuring Lemonis that took place on Sept. 10: https://investors.beyond.com/news-events/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2024/Piper-Sandler-Growth-Frontiers-Conference/default.aspx  Listen to it…or don’t. I don’t care. Lemonis goes into much more detail about the upcoming partnerships that will be announced at the investor conference happening on the day of earnings, as well as his vision for the company going forward. And he explains it all much better than some random regard on reddit ever could. He also takes ownership for the past mistakes that got us to where we are now. If you still aren’t convinced, cool. Go buy calls into NVIDIA earnings and enjoy crying in your wife’s boyfriend’s arms for a few days just like last time. Or buy the top on that incredible space stock after it’s up 20x in less than 6 months, get rug-pulled with a $400m share offering, and get rekt by the news drought. Or go do what Nana would want --buying deep ITMs in her meme stock... at least she might be proud of you. So what do I expect with the BYON stock? Short/medium term: Up. Long term: Really up. It looks good long term as everything spins up and the company transitions over the course of the next year. I don’t think analysts have accounted for the $177m run rate the newly relaunched Overstock website has hit since it went live at the beginning of Q3, or the fact that Zulily has been online for weeks already. Earnings will likely hit or exceed expectations, and even if it doesn’t, the partnerships being unveiled at the investor meeting and forward guidance will be impressive. There will likely be a runup even before earnings. When this stock moves, it MOVES. Here are my current positions as of writing this, but I'm not done buying yet...not even close. A YOLO update will follow after I've finished. Positions: Shotgun approach. Who knows when this thing will make its biggest moves. The random smattering of strikes may make you think I'm even more regarded than before, but liquidity is extremely thin and there were hot deals on different strikes at different times. **Tips if you feel this is a play you want to make and realize that if you just buy shares you're throwing your future gains in the trash: Liquidity on most option strikes/expiries is THIN, especially on the OTMs. Wait. wait. wait.

This company was Overstock.com and has rebranded itself. Bath towels are back, and they're better than ever before. Alright, listen up, you’re only going to hear this once, and you’re only going to hear it from me, as no one else seems to be paying attention. I’ve been watching this company for YEARS waiting for the perfect moment to get in, and that moment is right now.

That day the stock hit a low of $8.91. The bottom is in. About the Company: Overstock.com has been around a very long time, since 1999, but basically all you need to know about that is that they started out doing the thing their name suggests. Then they switched it up and started selling a more standard lineup of home goods. Their name just didn't reflect what they did anymore. In 2023, the former crowd favorite’s bath towel retailer went tits up, and the CEO of Overstock at the time saw a golden opportunity. They snapped up the IP of ye old towel stock, along with the name, customer data, etc.. They rebranded the company to Beyond Inc., switched their website UI’s color scheme from red to blue, and slapped the old towel company’s name on it.

It may have been last fall based solely on hype when Lemonis joined the board, when the stock hit almost $40, but it definitely isn’t as of right now. Lucky me. Maybe some other charts and light TA will convince you though. What we have right here is RSI divergence on the weekly chart.

You can see it bounced hard off the bottom band in the past few days.

Nothing. I just happen to be in the right place at the right time. Like I said, I’ve been watching this stock/company for years as a matter of personal interest. This is the inflection point. No one cares about this stock and most people still think the 3B brand no longer exists at all.

I don’t care. Lemonis goes into much more detail about the upcoming partnerships that will be announced at the investor conference happening on the day of earnings, as well as his vision for the company going forward. And he explains it all much better than some random regard on reddit ever could. He also takes ownership for the past mistakes that got us to where we are now. If you still aren’t convinced, cool.

It looks good long term as everything spins up and the company transitions over the course of the next year. I don’t think analysts have accounted for the $177m run rate the newly relaunched Overstock website has hit since it went live at the beginning of Q3, or the fact that Zulily has been online for weeks already. Earnings will likely hit or exceed expectations, and even if it doesn’t, the partnerships being unveiled at the investor meeting and forward guidance will be impressive.

,"**ATTENTION MODS AND HONOURABLE REPORT POLICE OF NEW: This DD and the company it covers is in no way related to the bankrupt legacy towel stock (RIP bagholders). This company was Overstock.com and has rebranded itself. Bath towels are back, and they're better than ever before. Alright, listen up, you’re only going to hear this once, and you’re only going to hear it from me, as no one else seems to be paying attention. I’ve been watching this company for YEARS waiting for the perfect moment to get in, and that moment is right now. Actually, it was last week on the day the last vestiges of peace Jared Kushner bestowed upon the Middle East finally evaporated. While simultaneously, the dock workers decided they were going to try to strongarm JPow into spinning up his money printer exclusively for their use --to fund their righteous battle against our future robot overlords. That day the stock hit a low of $8.91. The bottom is in. About the Company: Overstock.com has been around a very long time, since 1999, but basically all you need to know about that is that they started out doing the thing their name suggests. Then they switched it up and started selling a more standard lineup of home goods. Their name just didn't reflect what they did anymore. In 2023, the former crowd favorite’s bath towel retailer went tits up, and the CEO of Overstock at the time saw a golden opportunity. They snapped up the IP of ye old towel stock, along with the name, customer data, etc.. They rebranded the company to Beyond Inc., switched their website UI’s color scheme from red to blue, and slapped the old towel company’s name on it. (From here on I’ll refer to the forbidden name as triple-B, or 3B for short.) But somehow it wasn't an instant success... Overstock's original customers were left out in the cold, and the returning bath towel customers didn't like their product lineup. Things kept on declining. Enter Marcus Lemonis: He currently serves as the chairman and CEO of Camping World, a multi-billion dollar giant. He’s an activist investor specializing in turning around struggling businesses, and was key in building Camping World into what it is today. In Late 2023 he purchased a stake in Beyond and joined the board. He laid out plans to turn the business around, bring back Overstock.com, and promised results by the end of 2024. Well...things took longer than expected, including the relaunch of the Overstock.com website. So this is what happened: Now the stock is in the gutter, but the vision Lemonis has for the company is finally starting to come together. If you only care about earnings reports and staring at charts you might look at those and say to me: “Mr. Jimbles, you’re highly regarded. The revenue, EPS, and every other metric is worse YoY. The stock has been red every month for the past 6. This stock is going back to all-time lows, and likely, to zero.” And to which I will respond: “Why yes, thank you. I am highly regarded. You have an incredible talent for numbers and analysis. Slap an F rating on the stock, and go apply for a job at Motley Fool. They’d love to have you. You’ll fit right in there.” But this what has happened very recently: In July 2024 the Overstock.com website relaunched to exist alongside the new 3B website, specializing again in liquidating surplus inventory.  The Zulily IP, customer data, etc. was purchased in March of this year. If you haven’t heard of Zulily, they were another successful online retailer that went under after suffering from poor management, losing focus, and poor customer service, but the website had a cult following for its unique and exclusive selection of fashion goods. Beyond Inc. hired some of Zulily’s former team, and are bringing back your mom’s favorite fashion brands. They just soft-launched the new website a few weeks ago, but haven’t made any official announcement yet. Zulily.com Three new strategic partnerships have been teased that will restore a physical retail presence to the 3B brand. Now you might be thinking to yourself that this is a bad move, but having a physical store makes a lot of sense for home goods. Last I checked, you can’t download a credenza, and some people like to make sure the drapes match the carpet in person. One of these partnerships will deal with the Overstock arm of the business and will give them access to increased inventory and infrastructure to move what they already have. They just announced a new global licensing program to expand business internationally. They sold off their company HQ offices for $55m. Their balance sheet is good. Almost zero debt and plenty of cash for their upcoming moves. But that isn’t it by a long-shot. Lemonis has a vision for the Beyond umbrella to expand and include a whole slew of home related products and services including mortgages, home insurance, HELOCs, consumer credit cards, etc.. They plan to leverage the customer data gained from the retail businesses to onboard their existing customers for these other products in a frictionless, low cost way. And even though this pivot is finally taking shape now, none of it has been priced in.

,"**ATTENTION MODS AND HONOURABLE REPORT POLICE OF NEW: This DD and the company it covers is in no way related to the bankrupt legacy towel stock (RIP bagholders). This company was Overstock.com and has rebranded itself. Bath towels are back, and they're better than ever before. Alright, listen up, you’re only going to hear this once, and you’re only going to hear it from me, as no one else seems to be paying attention. I’ve been watching this company for YEARS waiting for the perfect moment to get in, and that moment is right now. Actually, it was last week on the day the last vestiges of peace Jared Kushner bestowed upon the Middle East finally evaporated. While simultaneously, the dock workers decided they were going to try to strongarm JPow into spinning up his money printer exclusively for their use --to fund their righteous battle against our future robot overlords. That day the stock hit a low of $8.91. The bottom is in. About the Company: Overstock.com has been around a very long time, since 1999, but basically all you need to know about that is that they started out doing the thing their name suggests. Then they switched it up and started selling a more standard lineup of home goods. Their name just didn't reflect what they did anymore. In 2023, the former crowd favorite’s bath towel retailer went tits up, and the CEO of Overstock at the time saw a golden opportunity. They snapped up the IP of ye old towel stock, along with the name, customer data, etc.. They rebranded the company to Beyond Inc., switched their website UI’s color scheme from red to blue, and slapped the old towel company’s name on it. (From here on I’ll refer to the forbidden name as triple-B, or 3B for short.) But somehow it wasn't an instant success... Overstock's original customers were left out in the cold, and the returning bath towel customers didn't like their product lineup. Things kept on declining. Enter Marcus Lemonis: He currently serves as the chairman and CEO of Camping World, a multi-billion dollar giant. He’s an activist investor specializing in turning around struggling businesses, and was key in building Camping World into what it is today. In Late 2023 he purchased a stake in Beyond and joined the board. He laid out plans to turn the business around, bring back Overstock.com, and promised results by the end of 2024. Well...things took longer than expected, including the relaunch of the Overstock.com website. So this is what happened: Now the stock is in the gutter, but the vision Lemonis has for the company is finally starting to come together. If you only care about earnings reports and staring at charts you might look at those and say to me: “Mr. Jimbles, you’re highly regarded. The revenue, EPS, and every other metric is worse YoY. The stock has been red every month for the past 6. This stock is going back to all-time lows, and likely, to zero.” And to which I will respond: “Why yes, thank you. I am highly regarded. You have an incredible talent for numbers and analysis. Slap an F rating on the stock, and go apply for a job at Motley Fool. They’d love to have you. You’ll fit right in there.” But this what has happened very recently: In July 2024 the Overstock.com website relaunched to exist alongside the new 3B website, specializing again in liquidating surplus inventory.  The Zulily IP, customer data, etc. was purchased in March of this year. If you haven’t heard of Zulily, they were another successful online retailer that went under after suffering from poor management, losing focus, and poor customer service, but the website had a cult following for its unique and exclusive selection of fashion goods. Beyond Inc. hired some of Zulily’s former team, and are bringing back your mom’s favorite fashion brands. They just soft-launched the new website a few weeks ago, but haven’t made any official announcement yet. Zulily.com Three new strategic partnerships have been teased that will restore a physical retail presence to the 3B brand. Now you might be thinking to yourself that this is a bad move, but having a physical store makes a lot of sense for home goods. Last I checked, you can’t download a credenza, and some people like to make sure the drapes match the carpet in person. One of these partnerships will deal with the Overstock arm of the business and will give them access to increased inventory and infrastructure to move what they already have. They just announced a new global licensing program to expand business internationally. They sold off their company HQ offices for $55m. Their balance sheet is good. Almost zero debt and plenty of cash for their upcoming moves. But that isn’t it by a long-shot. Lemonis has a vision for the Beyond umbrella to expand and include a whole slew of home related products and services including mortgages, home insurance, HELOCs, consumer credit cards, etc.. They plan to leverage the customer data gained from the retail businesses to onboard their existing customers for these other products in a frictionless, low cost way. And even though this pivot is finally taking shape now, none of it has been priced in. It may have been last fall based solely on hype when Lemonis joined the board, when the stock hit almost $40, but it definitely isn’t as of right now. Lucky me. Maybe some other charts and light TA will convince you though. What we have right here is RSI divergence on the weekly chart. The stock price is marching down, making lower lows, while RSI is trending up, making higher lows. Titillating, I know. You like Bollinger Bands??? Well here you go: On the daily, it’s consolidated, and the bands are tight enough to turn your wife’s boyfriend into a two pump chump. You can see it bounced hard off the bottom band in the past few days. Look at what happened last Friday when the dock workers settled for an insulting 62% raise and a guarantee that efficiency would not get in the way of union boss salaries: So what makes me sooooo smart and special? Nothing. I just happen to be in the right place at the right time. Like I said, I’ve been watching this stock/company for years as a matter of personal interest. This is the inflection point. No one cares about this stock and most people still think the 3B brand no longer exists at all. Analysts are asleep at the wheel, relying on ChatGPT to do their work for them, and GPT doesn’t know how to spoof an email and listen to a webcast yet. Here’s the webcast featuring Lemonis that took place on Sept. 10: https://investors.beyond.com/news-events/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2024/Piper-Sandler-Growth-Frontiers-Conference/default.aspx  Listen to it…or don’t. I don’t care. Lemonis goes into much more detail about the upcoming partnerships that will be announced at the investor conference happening on the day of earnings, as well as his vision for the company going forward. And he explains it all much better than some random regard on reddit ever could. He also takes ownership for the past mistakes that got us to where we are now. If you still aren’t convinced, cool. Go buy calls into NVIDIA earnings and enjoy crying in your wife’s boyfriend’s arms for a few days just like last time. Or buy the top on that incredible space stock after it’s up 20x in less than 6 months, get rug-pulled with a $400m share offering, and get rekt by the news drought. Or go do what Nana would want --buying deep ITMs in her meme stock... at least she might be proud of you. So what do I expect with the BYON stock? Short/medium term: Up. Long term: Really up. It looks good long term as everything spins up and the company transitions over the course of the next year. I don’t think analysts have accounted for the $177m run rate the newly relaunched Overstock website has hit since it went live at the beginning of Q3, or the fact that Zulily has been online for weeks already. Earnings will likely hit or exceed expectations, and even if it doesn’t, the partnerships being unveiled at the investor meeting and forward guidance will be impressive. There will likely be a runup even before earnings. When this stock moves, it MOVES. Here are my current positions as of writing this, but I'm not done buying yet...not even close. A YOLO update will follow after I've finished. Positions: Shotgun approach. Who knows when this thing will make its biggest moves. The random smattering of strikes may make you think I'm even more regarded than before, but liquidity is extremely thin and there were hot deals on different strikes at different times. **Tips if you feel this is a play you want to make and realize that if you just buy shares you're throwing your future gains in the trash: Liquidity on most option strikes/expiries is THIN, especially on the OTMs. Wait. wait. wait.

You’ll fit right in there.” But this what has happened very recently: In July 2024 the Overstock.com website relaunched to exist alongside the new 3B website, specializing again in liquidating surplus inventory.  The Zulily IP, customer data, etc. was purchased in March of this year. If you haven’t heard of Zulily, they were another successful online retailer that went under after suffering from poor management, losing focus, and poor customer service, but the website had a cult following for its unique and exclusive selection of fashion goods. Beyond Inc. hired some of Zulily’s former team, and are bringing back your mom’s favorite fashion brands. They just soft-launched the new website a few weeks ago, but haven’t made any official announcement yet. Zulily.com Three new strategic partnerships have been teased that will restore a physical retail presence to the 3B brand. Now you might be thinking to yourself that this is a bad move, but having a physical store makes a lot of sense for home goods. Last I checked, you can’t download a credenza, and some people like to make sure the drapes match the carpet in person. One of these partnerships will deal with the Overstock arm of the business and will give them access to increased inventory and infrastructure to move what they already have. They just announced a new global licensing program to expand business internationally. They sold off their company HQ offices for $55m. Their balance sheet is good. Almost zero debt and plenty of cash for their upcoming moves. But that isn’t it by a long-shot. Lemonis has a vision for the Beyond umbrella to expand and include a whole slew of home related products and services including mortgages, home insurance, HELOCs, consumer credit cards, etc.. They plan to leverage the customer data gained from the retail businesses to onboard their existing customers for these other products in a frictionless, low cost way. And even though this pivot is finally taking shape now, none of it has been priced in. It may have been last fall based solely on hype when Lemonis joined the board, when the stock hit almost $40, but it definitely isn’t as of right now. Lucky me. Maybe some other charts and light TA will convince you though. What we have right here is RSI divergence on the weekly chart. The stock price is marching down, making lower lows, while RSI is trending up, making higher lows. Titillating, I know. You like Bollinger Bands??? Well here you go: On the daily, it’s consolidated, and the bands are tight enough to turn your wife’s boyfriend into a two pump chump. You can see it bounced hard off the bottom band in the past few days. Look at what happened last Friday when the dock workers settled for an insulting 62% raise and a guarantee that efficiency would not get in the way of union boss salaries: So what makes me sooooo smart and special? Nothing. I just happen to be in the right place at the right time. Like I said, I’ve been watching this stock/company for years as a matter of personal interest. This is the inflection point. No one cares about this stock and most people still think the 3B brand no longer exists at all. Analysts are asleep at the wheel, relying on ChatGPT to do their work for them, and GPT doesn’t know how to spoof an email and listen to a webcast yet. Here’s the webcast featuring Lemonis that took place on Sept. 10: https://investors.beyond.com/news-events/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2024/Piper-Sandler-Growth-Frontiers-Conference/default.aspx  Listen to it…or don’t. I don’t care. Lemonis goes into much more detail about the upcoming partnerships that will be announced at the investor conference happening on the day of earnings, as well as his vision for the company going forward. And he explains it all much better than some random regard on reddit ever could. He also takes ownership for the past mistakes that got us to where we are now. If you still aren’t convinced, cool. Go buy calls into NVIDIA earnings and enjoy crying in your wife’s boyfriend’s arms for a few days just like last time. Or buy the top on that incredible space stock after it’s up 20x in less than 6 months, get rug-pulled with a $400m share offering, and get rekt by the news drought. Or go do what Nana would want --buying deep ITMs in her meme stock... at least she might be proud of you. So what do I expect with the BYON stock? Short/medium term: Up. Long term: Really up. It looks good long term as everything spins up and the company transitions over the course of the next year. I don’t think analysts have accounted for the $177m run rate the newly relaunched Overstock website has hit since it went live at the beginning of Q3, or the fact that Zulily has been online for weeks already. Earnings will likely hit or exceed expectations, and even if it doesn’t, the partnerships being unveiled at the investor meeting and forward guidance will be impressive. There will likely be a runup even before earnings. When this stock moves, it MOVES. Here are my current positions as of writing this, but I'm not done buying yet...not even close. A YOLO update will follow after I've finished. Positions: Shotgun approach. Who knows when this thing will make its biggest moves. The random smattering of strikes may make you think I'm even more regarded than before, but liquidity is extremely thin and there were hot deals on different strikes at different times. **Tips if you feel this is a play you want to make and realize that if you just buy shares you're throwing your future gains in the trash: Liquidity on most option strikes/expiries is THIN, especially on the OTMs. Wait. wait. wait.

,"**ATTENTION MODS AND HONOURABLE REPORT POLICE OF NEW: This DD and the company it covers is in no way related to the bankrupt legacy towel stock (RIP bagholders). This company was Overstock.com and has rebranded itself. Bath towels are back, and they're better than ever before. Alright, listen up, you’re only going to hear this once, and you’re only going to hear it from me, as no one else seems to be paying attention. I’ve been watching this company for YEARS waiting for the perfect moment to get in, and that moment is right now. Actually, it was last week on the day the last vestiges of peace Jared Kushner bestowed upon the Middle East finally evaporated. While simultaneously, the dock workers decided they were going to try to strongarm JPow into spinning up his money printer exclusively for their use --to fund their righteous battle against our future robot overlords. That day the stock hit a low of $8.91. The bottom is in. About the Company: Overstock.com has been around a very long time, since 1999, but basically all you need to know about that is that they started out doing the thing their name suggests. Then they switched it up and started selling a more standard lineup of home goods. Their name just didn't reflect what they did anymore. In 2023, the former crowd favorite’s bath towel retailer went tits up, and the CEO of Overstock at the time saw a golden opportunity. They snapped up the IP of ye old towel stock, along with the name, customer data, etc.. They rebranded the company to Beyond Inc., switched their website UI’s color scheme from red to blue, and slapped the old towel company’s name on it. (From here on I’ll refer to the forbidden name as triple-B, or 3B for short.) But somehow it wasn't an instant success... Overstock's original customers were left out in the cold, and the returning bath towel customers didn't like their product lineup. Things kept on declining. Enter Marcus Lemonis: He currently serves as the chairman and CEO of Camping World, a multi-billion dollar giant. He’s an activist investor specializing in turning around struggling businesses, and was key in building Camping World into what it is today. In Late 2023 he purchased a stake in Beyond and joined the board. He laid out plans to turn the business around, bring back Overstock.com, and promised results by the end of 2024. Well...things took longer than expected, including the relaunch of the Overstock.com website. So this is what happened: Now the stock is in the gutter, but the vision Lemonis has for the company is finally starting to come together. If you only care about earnings reports and staring at charts you might look at those and say to me: “Mr. Jimbles, you’re highly regarded. The revenue, EPS, and every other metric is worse YoY. The stock has been red every month for the past 6. This stock is going back to all-time lows, and likely, to zero.” And to which I will respond: “Why yes, thank you. I am highly regarded.

If you're really interested in the company/play it wouldn't be a bad idea to listen through/watch the investor conference they had along with this earnings.I'm tentatively bullish on the company still. I think Lemonis has a lot of good ideas and has reformed after giving too many overly optimistic projections. He seems to be making much more conservative promises. I think having physical towel stores again is going to be a great thing for the company, letting people out in the world know that the brand still exists.Lemonis bought $1.5m in shares after the earnings report/the stock tanking, which was by far his largest buy-in to date. That (unfortunately for me) did absolutely nothing to move the stock up. I think the market is waiting for tangible results before they're going to reprice. Shorts are probably still hoping for the bankruptcy. There was a lot of other bullish news before and after earnings, and again, none of that did anything to positively impact the price of the stock.That said, I think the stock is still highly undervalued even for the current situation. The company has a good balance sheet and other valuable assets. If you take the market cap and subtract their assets then the market is essentially valuing the company at $0.Lmk if you have any other questions though. Happy to chat despite the pain this has caused me.Edit: I do also still have a very small position on. Calls for next June and Jan 2026. I think that will be enough time for them to sort their shit out for the online stores as well as have a decent number of physical stores spun up.",3,0.567,NEGATIVE,1.0

,"**ATTENTION MODS AND HONOURABLE REPORT POLICE OF NEW: This DD and the company it covers is in no way related to the bankrupt legacy towel stock (RIP bagholders). This company was Overstock.com and has rebranded itself. Bath towels are back, and they're better than ever before. Alright, listen up, you’re only going to hear this once, and you’re only going to hear it from me, as no one else seems to be paying attention. I’ve been watching this company for YEARS waiting for the perfect moment to get in, and that moment is right now. Actually, it was last week on the day the last vestiges of peace Jared Kushner bestowed upon the Middle East finally evaporated. While simultaneously, the dock workers decided they were going to try to strongarm JPow into spinning up his money printer exclusively for their use --to fund their righteous battle against our future robot overlords. That day the stock hit a low of $8.91. The bottom is in. About the Company: Overstock.com has been around a very long time, since 1999, but basically all you need to know about that is that they started out doing the thing their name suggests. Then they switched it up and started selling a more standard lineup of home goods. Their name just didn't reflect what they did anymore. In 2023, the former crowd favorite’s bath towel retailer went tits up, and the CEO of Overstock at the time saw a golden opportunity. They snapped up the IP of ye old towel stock, along with the name, customer data, etc.. They rebranded the company to Beyond Inc., switched their website UI’s color scheme from red to blue, and slapped the old towel company’s name on it. (From here on I’ll refer to the forbidden name as triple-B, or 3B for short.) But somehow it wasn't an instant success... Overstock's original customers were left out in the cold, and the returning bath towel customers didn't like their product lineup. Things kept on declining. Enter Marcus Lemonis: He currently serves as the chairman and CEO of Camping World, a multi-billion dollar giant. He’s an activist investor specializing in turning around struggling businesses, and was key in building Camping World into what it is today. In Late 2023 he purchased a stake in Beyond and joined the board. He laid out plans to turn the business around, bring back Overstock.com, and promised results by the end of 2024. Well...things took longer than expected, including the relaunch of the Overstock.com website. So this is what happened: Now the stock is in the gutter, but the vision Lemonis has for the company is finally starting to come together. If you only care about earnings reports and staring at charts you might look at those and say to me: “Mr. Jimbles, you’re highly regarded. The revenue, EPS, and every other metric is worse YoY. The stock has been red every month for the past 6. This stock is going back to all-time lows, and likely, to zero.” And to which I will respond: “Why yes, thank you. I am highly regarded. You have an incredible talent for numbers and analysis. Slap an F rating on the stock, and go apply for a job at Motley Fool. They’d love to have you. You’ll fit right in there.” But this what has happened very recently: In July 2024 the Overstock.com website relaunched to exist alongside the new 3B website, specializing again in liquidating surplus inventory.  The Zulily IP, customer data, etc. was purchased in March of this year. If you haven’t heard of Zulily, they were another successful online retailer that went under after suffering from poor management, losing focus, and poor customer service, but the website had a cult following for its unique and exclusive selection of fashion goods. Beyond Inc. hired some of Zulily’s former team, and are bringing back your mom’s favorite fashion brands. They just soft-launched the new website a few weeks ago, but haven’t made any official announcement yet. Zulily.com Three new strategic partnerships have been teased that will restore a physical retail presence to the 3B brand. Now you might be thinking to yourself that this is a bad move, but having a physical store makes a lot of sense for home goods. Last I checked, you can’t download a credenza, and some people like to make sure the drapes match the carpet in person. One of these partnerships will deal with the Overstock arm of the business and will give them access to increased inventory and infrastructure to move what they already have. They just announced a new global licensing program to expand business internationally. They sold off their company HQ offices for $55m. Their balance sheet is good. Almost zero debt and plenty of cash for their upcoming moves. But that isn’t it by a long-shot.

,"**ATTENTION MODS AND HONOURABLE REPORT POLICE OF NEW: This DD and the company it covers is in no way related to the bankrupt legacy towel stock (RIP bagholders). This company was Overstock.com and has rebranded itself. Bath towels are back, and they're better than ever before. Alright, listen up, you’re only going to hear this once, and you’re only going to hear it from me, as no one else seems to be paying attention. I’ve been watching this company for YEARS waiting for the perfect moment to get in, and that moment is right now. Actually, it was last week on the day the last vestiges of peace Jared Kushner bestowed upon the Middle East finally evaporated. While simultaneously, the dock workers decided they were going to try to strongarm JPow into spinning up his money printer exclusively for their use --to fund their righteous battle against our future robot overlords. That day the stock hit a low of $8.91. The bottom is in. About the Company: Overstock.com has been around a very long time, since 1999, but basically all you need to know about that is that they started out doing the thing their name suggests. Then they switched it up and started selling a more standard lineup of home goods. Their name just didn't reflect what they did anymore. In 2023, the former crowd favorite’s bath towel retailer went tits up, and the CEO of Overstock at the time saw a golden opportunity. They snapped up the IP of ye old towel stock, along with the name, customer data, etc.. They rebranded the company to Beyond Inc., switched their website UI’s color scheme from red to blue, and slapped the old towel company’s name on it. (From here on I’ll refer to the forbidden name as triple-B, or 3B for short.) But somehow it wasn't an instant success... Overstock's original customers were left out in the cold, and the returning bath towel customers didn't like their product lineup. Things kept on declining. Enter Marcus Lemonis: He currently serves as the chairman and CEO of Camping World, a multi-billion dollar giant. He’s an activist investor specializing in turning around struggling businesses, and was key in building Camping World into what it is today. In Late 2023 he purchased a stake in Beyond and joined the board. He laid out plans to turn the business around, bring back Overstock.com, and promised results by the end of 2024. Well...things took longer than expected, including the relaunch of the Overstock.com website. So this is what happened: Now the stock is in the gutter, but the vision Lemonis has for the company is finally starting to come together. If you only care about earnings reports and staring at charts you might look at those and say to me: “Mr. Jimbles, you’re highly regarded. The revenue, EPS, and every other metric is worse YoY. The stock has been red every month for the past 6. This stock is going back to all-time lows, and likely, to zero.” And to which I will respond: “Why yes, thank you. I am highly regarded. You have an incredible talent for numbers and analysis. Slap an F rating on the stock, and go apply for a job at Motley Fool. They’d love to have you. You’ll fit right in there.” But this what has happened very recently: In July 2024 the Overstock.com website relaunched to exist alongside the new 3B website, specializing again in liquidating surplus inventory.  The Zulily IP, customer data, etc. was purchased in March of this year. If you haven’t heard of Zulily, they were another successful online retailer that went under after suffering from poor management, losing focus, and poor customer service, but the website had a cult following for its unique and exclusive selection of fashion goods. Beyond Inc. hired some of Zulily’s former team, and are bringing back your mom’s favorite fashion brands. They just soft-launched the new website a few weeks ago, but haven’t made any official announcement yet. Zulily.com Three new strategic partnerships have been teased that will restore a physical retail presence to the 3B brand. Now you might be thinking to yourself that this is a bad move, but having a physical store makes a lot of sense for home goods. Last I checked, you can’t download a credenza, and some people like to make sure the drapes match the carpet in person. One of these partnerships will deal with the Overstock arm of the business and will give them access to increased inventory and infrastructure to move what they already have. They just announced a new global licensing program to expand business internationally. They sold off their company HQ offices for $55m. Their balance sheet is good. Almost zero debt and plenty of cash for their upcoming moves. But that isn’t it by a long-shot. Lemonis has a vision for the Beyond umbrella to expand and include a whole slew of home related products and services including mortgages, home insurance, HELOCs, consumer credit cards, etc.. They plan to leverage the customer data gained from the retail businesses to onboard their existing customers for these other products in a frictionless, low cost way. And even though this pivot is finally taking shape now, none of it has been priced in. It may have been last fall based solely on hype when Lemonis joined the board, when the stock hit almost $40, but it definitely isn’t as of right now. Lucky me. Maybe some other charts and light TA will convince you though. What we have right here is RSI divergence on the weekly chart. The stock price is marching down, making lower lows, while RSI is trending up, making higher lows. Titillating, I know. You like Bollinger Bands??? Well here you go: On the daily, it’s consolidated, and the bands are tight enough to turn your wife’s boyfriend into a two pump chump. You can see it bounced hard off the bottom band in the past few days. Look at what happened last Friday when the dock workers settled for an insulting 62% raise and a guarantee that efficiency would not get in the way of union boss salaries: So what makes me sooooo smart and special? Nothing. I just happen to be in the right place at the right time. Like I said, I’ve been watching this stock/company for years as a matter of personal interest. This is the inflection point. No one cares about this stock and most people still think the 3B brand no longer exists at all. Analysts are asleep at the wheel, relying on ChatGPT to do their work for them, and GPT doesn’t know how to spoof an email and listen to a webcast yet. Here’s the webcast featuring Lemonis that took place on Sept. 10: https://investors.beyond.com/news-events/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2024/Piper-Sandler-Growth-Frontiers-Conference/default.aspx  Listen to it…or don’t. I don’t care. Lemonis goes into much more detail about the upcoming partnerships that will be announced at the investor conference happening on the day of earnings, as well as his vision for the company going forward. And he explains it all much better than some random regard on reddit ever could. He also takes ownership for the past mistakes that got us to where we are now. If you still aren’t convinced, cool. Go buy calls into NVIDIA earnings and enjoy crying in your wife’s boyfriend’s arms for a few days just like last time. Or buy the top on that incredible space stock after it’s up 20x in less than 6 months, get rug-pulled with a $400m share offering, and get rekt by the news drought. Or go do what Nana would want --buying deep ITMs in her meme stock... at least she might be proud of you. So what do I expect with the BYON stock? Short/medium term: Up. Long term: Really up. It looks good long term as everything spins up and the company transitions over the course of the next year. I don’t think analysts have accounted for the $177m run rate the newly relaunched Overstock website has hit since it went live at the beginning of Q3, or the fact that Zulily has been online for weeks already. Earnings will likely hit or exceed expectations, and even if it doesn’t, the partnerships being unveiled at the investor meeting and forward guidance will be impressive.

Overstock's original customers were left out in the cold, and the returning bath towel customers didn't like their product lineup. Things kept on declining. Enter Marcus Lemonis: He currently serves as the chairman and CEO of Camping World, a multi-billion dollar giant. He’s an activist investor specializing in turning around struggling businesses, and was key in building Camping World into what it is today. In Late 2023 he purchased a stake in Beyond and joined the board. He laid out plans to turn the business around, bring back Overstock.com, and promised results by the end of 2024. Well...things took longer than expected, including the relaunch of the Overstock.com website. So this is what happened: Now the stock is in the gutter, but the vision Lemonis has for the company is finally starting to come together. If you only care about earnings reports and staring at charts you might look at those and say to me: “Mr. Jimbles, you’re highly regarded. The revenue, EPS, and every other metric is worse YoY. The stock has been red every month for the past 6. This stock is going back to all-time lows, and likely, to zero.” And to which I will respond: “Why yes, thank you. I am highly regarded. You have an incredible talent for numbers and analysis. Slap an F rating on the stock, and go apply for a job at Motley Fool. They’d love to have you. You’ll fit right in there.” But this what has happened very recently: In July 2024 the Overstock.com website relaunched to exist alongside the new 3B website, specializing again in liquidating surplus inventory.  The Zulily IP, customer data, etc. was purchased in March of this year. If you haven’t heard of Zulily, they were another successful online retailer that went under after suffering from poor management, losing focus, and poor customer service, but the website had a cult following for its unique and exclusive selection of fashion goods. Beyond Inc. hired some of Zulily’s former team, and are bringing back your mom’s favorite fashion brands. They just soft-launched the new website a few weeks ago, but haven’t made any official announcement yet. Zulily.com Three new strategic partnerships have been teased that will restore a physical retail presence to the 3B brand. Now you might be thinking to yourself that this is a bad move, but having a physical store makes a lot of sense for home goods. Last I checked, you can’t download a credenza, and some people like to make sure the drapes match the carpet in person. One of these partnerships will deal with the Overstock arm of the business and will give them access to increased inventory and infrastructure to move what they already have. They just announced a new global licensing program to expand business internationally. They sold off their company HQ offices for $55m. Their balance sheet is good. Almost zero debt and plenty of cash for their upcoming moves. But that isn’t it by a long-shot. Lemonis has a vision for the Beyond umbrella to expand and include a whole slew of home related products and services including mortgages, home insurance, HELOCs, consumer credit cards, etc.. They plan to leverage the customer data gained from the retail businesses to onboard their existing customers for these other products in a frictionless, low cost way. And even though this pivot is finally taking shape now, none of it has been priced in. It may have been last fall based solely on hype when Lemonis joined the board, when the stock hit almost $40, but it definitely isn’t as of right now. Lucky me. Maybe some other charts and light TA will convince you though. What we have right here is RSI divergence on the weekly chart. The stock price is marching down, making lower lows, while RSI is trending up, making higher lows. Titillating, I know. You like Bollinger Bands??? Well here you go: On the daily, it’s consolidated, and the bands are tight enough to turn your wife’s boyfriend into a two pump chump. You can see it bounced hard off the bottom band in the past few days. Look at what happened last Friday when the dock workers settled for an insulting 62% raise and a guarantee that efficiency would not get in the way of union boss salaries: So what makes me sooooo smart and special? Nothing. I just happen to be in the right place at the right time. Like I said, I’ve been watching this stock/company for years as a matter of personal interest. This is the inflection point. No one cares about this stock and most people still think the 3B brand no longer exists at all. Analysts are asleep at the wheel, relying on ChatGPT to do their work for them, and GPT doesn’t know how to spoof an email and listen to a webcast yet. Here’s the webcast featuring Lemonis that took place on Sept. 10: https://investors.beyond.com/news-events/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2024/Piper-Sandler-Growth-Frontiers-Conference/default.aspx  Listen to it…or don’t. I don’t care. Lemonis goes into much more detail about the upcoming partnerships that will be announced at the investor conference happening on the day of earnings, as well as his vision for the company going forward. And he explains it all much better than some random regard on reddit ever could. He also takes ownership for the past mistakes that got us to where we are now. If you still aren’t convinced, cool. Go buy calls into NVIDIA earnings and enjoy crying in your wife’s boyfriend’s arms for a few days just like last time. Or buy the top on that incredible space stock after it’s up 20x in less than 6 months, get rug-pulled with a $400m share offering, and get rekt by the news drought. Or go do what Nana would want --buying deep ITMs in her meme stock... at least she might be proud of you. So what do I expect with the BYON stock? Short/medium term: Up. Long term: Really up. It looks good long term as everything spins up and the company transitions over the course of the next year. I don’t think analysts have accounted for the $177m run rate the newly relaunched Overstock website has hit since it went live at the beginning of Q3, or the fact that Zulily has been online for weeks already. Earnings will likely hit or exceed expectations, and even if it doesn’t, the partnerships being unveiled at the investor meeting and forward guidance will be impressive. There will likely be a runup even before earnings. When this stock moves, it MOVES. Here are my current positions as of writing this, but I'm not done buying yet...not even close. A YOLO update will follow after I've finished. Positions: Shotgun approach. Who knows when this thing will make its biggest moves. The random smattering of strikes may make you think I'm even more regarded than before, but liquidity is extremely thin and there were hot deals on different strikes at different times. **Tips if you feel this is a play you want to make and realize that if you just buy shares you're throwing your future gains in the trash: Liquidity on most option strikes/expiries is THIN, especially on the OTMs. Wait. wait. wait. You're thinking you'll just avoid all this by buying ITM/NTM? On a stock this undervalued?? Go back to where you belong. You know...that special sub where their best and only advice is DCA'ing into SPY. I recommend doing limits or 1 lot market orders b/c you might even get a few better fills that way. If you do big market orders you’re gonna get cucked on the way in and on the way out… if you make it that far. If you don’t know what the word slippage means...good luck. **Hint** It doesn't have anything to do with what happens to your wife while watching you unbutton her boyfriend's sport-coat.
