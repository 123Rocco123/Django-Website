You have hope if you just do your research first.The Intel forums on the other hand...good luck! I know because I had some junior engineers research the different AI hardware paths we could take about 5 years ago and the Intel stuff was sooooo bad for even basic support, like getting started. Part of my final recommendation showed that the number of total forum posts was at least 2-3 orders of magnitude higher for Nvidia than Intel. If that doesn't show you where developers are going, what else will?I suspect this half price AI chip that just came out of nowhere is Intel taking a huge internal hit on costs to try to gain some market share in that environment. It is unsustainable for them and we'll see that in 1-2 years when all of a sudden some yearly fee, or the initial costs skyrocket.But the schaudenfraude is that they already missed the boat!

Here's a breakdown of the main points:Processor comparison: The person is saying that comparing a new chip to an EPYC processor (made by AMD) for AI tasks isn't meaningful. It's like comparing a sports car to a truck for a race - they're not typically used for the same purpose.What's actually used for AI: Instead of regular processors, AI tasks usually use specialized hardware called GPUs (Graphics Processing Units). These are much better suited for AI work because they can handle many calculations at once.Adoption challenges: For a new AI chip to be successful, it needs to be significantly more efficient (faster and use less power) than existing options. Also, companies need to trust that the technology will stick around for a while. The person suggests that Intel, who's trying to enter this market, doesn't currently inspire this confidence.Big tech companies' strategies: Major tech companies like Google, Meta (Facebook), Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft are developing their own specialized AI chips. This means they're less likely to switch to a new option from another company.AMD's advantage: The person believes AMD (another chip company) has a better chance of competing with NVIDIA (the current leader in AI chips) because their technology is similar and can run the same software with minimal changes.Intel's approach: Intel's new AI technology (called Gaudi) requires users to modify their existing code to work with it. The person suggests this extra step might not fit well with how companies currently develop AI systems.In essence, the main point is that entering the AI chip market is challenging. It's not just about having fast hardware - it's about fitting into the existing ecosystem, being efficient, and gaining the trust of big tech companies who are also developing their own solutions.",1,,0.567,NEGATIVE,0.997
