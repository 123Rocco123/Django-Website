Are these calls dead or should I sit on the plug and let them ride",I’m optimistic that Nvda will pop back too but I don’t get this strike point. With that premium you need it to hit 160? To hit b/e in a worst case/late case scenario. It’s been dipping low enough ATM options are looking safe to at least b/e by xmas.Also imo I would be cautious about anything going into Feb or later. I dunno how young the traders are today if they remember the first term but the tariffs are not bluffs and they will trigger a lot of disruptions.,0,0.516,NEGATIVE,1.0
