,"This is not a political post. I just wanted to hear your thoughts about this issue. Given that China is already suspicious about western tech (as are we of China's) and basically after the 7th of October other big arab countries (UAE) have been very critical of Israel I think that these countries are gonna be very skeptical about buying more US products made in places like Taiwan. Even though Taiwan denied that the pagers were made there I'd be scarred if I was in a country that opposes Israel since they just proved that our own electronic devices can be made into lethal weapons. Basically they opened the door for many possible nightmarish scenarios. Imagine if your iPhone or NVIDIA GPU just explodes. Anyway this might be a regarded thought but I'm interested in your responses. No positions as of right now cuz I plan on losing money on rate cuts tonight. TLDR: Eastern countries may be too scarred to buy much more tech made in Taiwan/countries with US-Israel interest, now that Israel proved that they can use eevryday products as weapons.",GPT-REEEE,0,,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

They were already sabotaged before reaching Hezbollah as a final customer because Israeli discovered about the furniture. The devices have been filled up with a mix of explosive substances that needed heat to initiate the countdown. Now the hacking part is that Israeli knew a back door on the devices which allowed for temperature increases through specific commands that hit the battery which started the kaboom part on the hidden explosive. A lot of reports from hitten people prove that their devices started to feel very hot seconds before the explosion so the smart ones threw them away before. The dumb ones ignored the heat or started to closely look at it.,0,,0.511,NEGATIVE,1.0

The PRC has a near complete independent tech stack at this point, so that is an inevitable outcome. If US stock prices are still buoyed by hope of sales in China, that's just cope. https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/23/tech/huawei-apple-smartphone-sales-china-hnk-intl/index.htmlWhere this news is going to have effect are in those mid-tier countries that are politically non-aligned, particularly those who are Muslim in SE Asia like Malaysia and Indonesia, where the US doesn't have firm influence.

This is what killed Apple on PC, and they are repeating it with phones. Huwawei isn't competing with Apple, they are competing with Samsung, Motorola, HTC etc. iOS has had <30% of global market share for the past 15 years. Apple is sometimes the top selling phone maker globally but usually not. Right now that looks like Samsung.For someone with an average income of $10k/year like in Indonesia, that $1000 phone is priced out of reach. Would you spend 1/10th your yearly income on a phone?Tesla said at their inception their goal was to make an inexpensive electric people's car. BYD beat them to the punch. The idea of making a cheap car is a good one, it is just the US makers can't get over their markups. It's more profitable to sell a $50k car than it is to sell a $10k car, just as it is more profitable to sell a $1000 phone than it is to sell a $200 phone.When you have a bunch of profit being made, someone is going to come in and undercut. If someone is making a zillion dollars doing something, someone else is going to find a way to do it for half a zillion dollars. This is the way.The Chinese, with their scale, are happy to make $10 on a widget when the US companies need to make $100 on the widget. Aside from just paying their people less and having the people profiting also be the regulators, they know they can scale to their own huge market, and extend that to the billions of people in the world that aren't US rich. They also aren't answering to shareholders demand for profit to the extent that US companies are.",3,,0.537,NEGATIVE,1.0
