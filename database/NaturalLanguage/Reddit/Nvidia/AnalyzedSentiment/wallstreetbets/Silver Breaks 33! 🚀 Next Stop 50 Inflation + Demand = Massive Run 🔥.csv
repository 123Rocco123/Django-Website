,"Silver Ounce/ U.S. Dollar, 4h Context: Silver apes, it‚Äôs happening. We just broke $33.68, and the charts are screaming bullish. This isn‚Äôt just your average end of week move; this is silver gearing up for something big. With inflation still out of control and central banks scrambling, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before silver shoots up even more. Here‚Äôs why I think we‚Äôre in for a massive run: Key Resistance Broken: We‚Äôve been watching the $32-32.5/Oz resistance for weeks (touched the resistance 5x and bounced back each time), and now that we‚Äôve smashed through it, we could easily be seeing silver charge to $35/Oz in no time. This is a breakout move that‚Äôs catching a lot of attention. Silver Demand is Heating Up: With its role in electronics and solar tech as well as a safe-haven asset, the demand for silver is surging. And supply? Still constrained. This imbalance means silver prices are set to keep climbing, especially with industrial demand keeping pressure on supply chains. Dollar Weakness: As the USD wobbles, silver gains strength. If the dollar stays weak, silver‚Äôs going to continue its upward trajectory. With $35 in sight, this is looking like the start of a massive silver rally. Last time we saw this setup, silver skyrocketed to $50‚Äîso the potential here is huge. P.S. (Even if the feds manage to keep the dollar under control in the short-term for the fist time in history we are seeing the value of precious metals not being inversely affected by the USDIndex. This should be a strong indicator of what's about to happen.) My Call: Long and looking for a move to $35-$40/Oz. If you‚Äôre not stacking your silver now, you‚Äôll be wishing you did when we‚Äôre sitting at $50/Oz. ü¶çüöÄ Reminder: This is a long play, and when silver moves, it moves hard.

Industrial Demand Continues to Surge Silver isn‚Äôt just a precious metal; it‚Äôs a critical component in various high-growth industries. According to the Silver Institute's 2024 World Silver Survey, industrial demand for silver is projected to reach 550 million ounces this year, a significant increase driven by its applications in electronics, solar energy, and electric vehicles. Electronics: Silver‚Äôs unparalleled electrical conductivity makes it indispensable in smartphones, laptops, and other consumer electronics. Solar Panels: With the global push towards renewable energy, silver‚Äôs role in photovoltaic cells ensures sustained demand. Electric Vehicles (EVs): The rise of EVs has boosted silver usage in batteries and other components, contributing to its demand surge. 2. Supply Constraints Intensify Despite increasing demand, silver production hasn‚Äôt kept pace. The World Silver Survey 2024 highlights a supply deficit of 80 million ounces this year. Key factors include: Mining Challenges: Several major silver mines have faced operational disruptions due to geopolitical tensions and environmental regulations. Limited New Projects: Investment in new silver mining projects remains low, causing a bottleneck in supply. 3. Investment Demand on the Rise Silver ETFs and other investment vehicles are witnessing renewed interest. Data from Bloomberg indicates that silver ETF inflows have increased by 15% in the first half of 2024. This uptick is fueled by: Affordability: Silver remains more accessible than gold, attracting retail investors looking for cost-effective entry points. Hedge Against Economic Uncertainty: Even as inflation rates stabilize, silver continues to serve as a hedge against market volatility and currency fluctuations. 4. Geopolitical Tensions and Safe Haven Appeal In times of geopolitical instability, investors flock to safe haven assets. Silver, like gold, benefits from this sentiment. The ongoing trade tensions between major economies and regional conflicts have heightened the demand for tangible assets that retain value amidst uncertainty. 5. Technological Advancements Enhancing Silver‚Äôs Value Innovations in technology are expanding silver‚Äôs applications, further solidifying its status as a valuable asset. Breakthroughs in nanotechnology and medical devices are opening new avenues for silver usage, ensuring sustained and diversified demand. 6. Gold-to-Silver Ratio Indicates Undervaluation The gold-to-silver ratio is currently around 70:1, historically signalling that silver is undervalued relative to gold",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999,0.5,0.999

According to the Silver Institute's 2024 World Silver Survey, industrial demand for silver is projected to reach 550 million ounces this year, a significant increase driven by its applications in electronics, solar energy, and electric vehicles. Electronics: Silver‚Äôs unparalleled electrical conductivity makes it indispensable in smartphones, laptops, and other consumer electronics. Solar Panels: With the global push towards renewable energy, silver‚Äôs role in photovoltaic cells ensures sustained demand. Electric Vehicles (EVs): The rise of EVs has boosted silver usage in batteries and other components, contributing to its demand surge. 2. Supply Constraints Intensify Despite increasing demand, silver production hasn‚Äôt kept pace. The World Silver Survey 2024 highlights a supply deficit of 80 million ounces this year. Key factors include: Mining Challenges: Several major silver mines have faced operational disruptions due to geopolitical tensions and environmental regulations. Limited New Projects: Investment in new silver mining projects remains low, causing a bottleneck in supply. 3. Investment Demand on the Rise Silver ETFs and other investment vehicles are witnessing renewed interest. Data from Bloomberg indicates that silver ETF inflows have increased by 15% in the first half of 2024. This uptick is fueled by: Affordability: Silver remains more accessible than gold, attracting retail investors looking for cost-effective entry points. Hedge Against Economic Uncertainty: Even as inflation rates stabilize, silver continues to serve as a hedge against market volatility and currency fluctuations. 4. Geopolitical Tensions and Safe Haven Appeal In times of geopolitical instability, investors flock to safe haven assets. Silver, like gold, benefits from this sentiment. The ongoing trade tensions between major economies and regional conflicts have heightened the demand for tangible assets that retain value amidst uncertainty. 5. Technological Advancements Enhancing Silver‚Äôs Value Innovations in technology are expanding silver‚Äôs applications, further solidifying its status as a valuable asset. Breakthroughs in nanotechnology and medical devices are opening new avenues for silver usage, ensuring sustained and diversified demand. 6. Gold-to-Silver Ratio Indicates Undervaluation The gold-to-silver ratio is currently around 70:1, historically signalling that silver is undervalued relative to gold",That was what they said about 15 yrs ago when silver hit $30.

,"Silver Ounce/ U.S. Dollar, 4h Context: Silver apes, it‚Äôs happening. We just broke $33.68, and the charts are screaming bullish.

With inflation still out of control and central banks scrambling, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before silver shoots up even more. Here‚Äôs why I think we‚Äôre in for a massive run: Key Resistance Broken: We‚Äôve been watching the $32-32.5/Oz resistance for weeks (touched the resistance 5x and bounced back each time), and now that we‚Äôve smashed through it, we could easily be seeing silver charge to $35/Oz in no time. This is a breakout move that‚Äôs catching a lot of attention. Silver Demand is Heating Up: With its role in electronics and solar tech as well as a safe-haven asset, the demand for silver is surging. And supply? Still constrained. This imbalance means silver prices are set to keep climbing, especially with industrial demand keeping pressure on supply chains. Dollar Weakness: As the USD wobbles, silver gains strength. If the dollar stays weak, silver‚Äôs going to continue its upward trajectory. With $35 in sight, this is looking like the start of a massive silver rally. Last time we saw this setup, silver skyrocketed to $50‚Äîso the potential here is huge. P.S.

This uptick is fueled by: Affordability: Silver remains more accessible than gold, attracting retail investors looking for cost-effective entry points. Hedge Against Economic Uncertainty: Even as inflation rates stabilize, silver continues to serve as a hedge against market volatility and currency fluctuations. 4. Geopolitical Tensions and Safe Haven Appeal In times of geopolitical instability, investors flock to safe haven assets. Silver, like gold, benefits from this sentiment. The ongoing trade tensions between major economies and regional conflicts have heightened the demand for tangible assets that retain value amidst uncertainty. 5.

,"Silver Ounce/ U.S. Dollar, 4h Context: Silver apes, it‚Äôs happening. We just broke $33.68, and the charts are screaming bullish. This isn‚Äôt just your average end of week move; this is silver gearing up for something big. With inflation still out of control and central banks scrambling, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before silver shoots up even more. Here‚Äôs why I think we‚Äôre in for a massive run: Key Resistance Broken: We‚Äôve been watching the $32-32.5/Oz resistance for weeks (touched the resistance 5x and bounced back each time), and now that we‚Äôve smashed through it, we could easily be seeing silver charge to $35/Oz in no time. This is a breakout move that‚Äôs catching a lot of attention. Silver Demand is Heating Up: With its role in electronics and solar tech as well as a safe-haven asset, the demand for silver is surging. And supply? Still constrained. This imbalance means silver prices are set to keep climbing, especially with industrial demand keeping pressure on supply chains. Dollar Weakness: As the USD wobbles, silver gains strength. If the dollar stays weak, silver‚Äôs going to continue its upward trajectory. With $35 in sight, this is looking like the start of a massive silver rally. Last time we saw this setup, silver skyrocketed to $50‚Äîso the potential here is huge. P.S.

This should be a strong indicator of what's about to happen.) My Call: Long and looking for a move to $35-$40/Oz. If you‚Äôre not stacking your silver now, you‚Äôll be wishing you did when we‚Äôre sitting at $50/Oz. ü¶çüöÄ Reminder: This is a long play, and when silver moves, it moves hard.

According to the Silver Institute's 2024 World Silver Survey, industrial demand for silver is projected to reach 550 million ounces this year, a significant increase driven by its applications in electronics, solar energy, and electric vehicles.

Supply Constraints Intensify Despite increasing demand, silver production hasn‚Äôt kept pace. The World Silver Survey 2024 highlights a supply deficit of 80 million ounces this year. Key factors include: Mining Challenges: Several major silver mines have faced operational disruptions due to geopolitical tensions and environmental regulations.

Industrial Demand Continues to Surge Silver isn‚Äôt just a precious metal; it‚Äôs a critical component in various high-growth industries. According to the Silver Institute's 2024 World Silver Survey, industrial demand for silver is projected to reach 550 million ounces this year, a significant increase driven by its applications in electronics, solar energy, and electric vehicles. Electronics: Silver‚Äôs unparalleled electrical conductivity makes it indispensable in smartphones, laptops, and other consumer electronics. Solar Panels: With the global push towards renewable energy, silver‚Äôs role in photovoltaic cells ensures sustained demand. Electric Vehicles (EVs): The rise of EVs has boosted silver usage in batteries and other components, contributing to its demand surge. 2. Supply Constraints Intensify Despite increasing demand, silver production hasn‚Äôt kept pace. The World Silver Survey 2024 highlights a supply deficit of 80 million ounces this year. Key factors include: Mining Challenges: Several major silver mines have faced operational disruptions due to geopolitical tensions and environmental regulations. Limited New Projects: Investment in new silver mining projects remains low, causing a bottleneck in supply. 3. Investment Demand on the Rise Silver ETFs and other investment vehicles are witnessing renewed interest. Data from Bloomberg indicates that silver ETF inflows have increased by 15% in the first half of 2024. This uptick is fueled by: Affordability: Silver remains more accessible than gold, attracting retail investors looking for cost-effective entry points. Hedge Against Economic Uncertainty: Even as inflation rates stabilize, silver continues to serve as a hedge against market volatility and currency fluctuations. 4. Geopolitical Tensions and Safe Haven Appeal In times of geopolitical instability, investors flock to safe haven assets. Silver, like gold, benefits from this sentiment. The ongoing trade tensions between major economies and regional conflicts have heightened the demand for tangible assets that retain value amidst uncertainty. 5. Technological Advancements Enhancing Silver‚Äôs Value Innovations in technology are expanding silver‚Äôs applications, further solidifying its status as a valuable asset. Breakthroughs in nanotechnology and medical devices are opening new avenues for silver usage, ensuring sustained and diversified demand. 6.

With inflation still out of control and central banks scrambling, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before silver shoots up even more.

Especially Aluminium that is influenced by its industry uses (growing due to on going wars, weapons, vehicles, missiles, etc. ) however also influenced greatly by energy prices as the smelting process is very energy intensive. Lower than usual energy prices this year means its cheaper to make + increasing demand = volatility.Personally I would stick to silver and gold long term as they have historical statistical backing and I would buy aluminium and lead at extreme lows (watch RSI) and don't hold them for long.Edit: The reason I choose silver over gold right now is because it is extremely undervalued in comparison. Higher risk I agree, but high risk = higher reward which is what I am looking for with my current portfolio.",5,0.529,NEGATIVE,1.0,0.529,1.0
,"Silver Ounce/ U.S. Dollar, 4h Context: Silver apes, it‚Äôs happening. We just broke $33.68, and the charts are screaming bullish. This isn‚Äôt just your average end of week move; this is silver gearing up for something big. With inflation still out of control and central banks scrambling, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before silver shoots up even more. Here‚Äôs why I think we‚Äôre in for a massive run: Key Resistance Broken: We‚Äôve been watching the $32-32.5/Oz resistance for weeks (touched the resistance 5x and bounced back each time), and now that we‚Äôve smashed through it, we could easily be seeing silver charge to $35/Oz in no time. This is a breakout move that‚Äôs catching a lot of attention. Silver Demand is Heating Up: With its role in electronics and solar tech as well as a safe-haven asset, the demand for silver is surging. And supply? Still constrained. This imbalance means silver prices are set to keep climbing, especially with industrial demand keeping pressure on supply chains. Dollar Weakness: As the USD wobbles, silver gains strength. If the dollar stays weak, silver‚Äôs going to continue its upward trajectory. With $35 in sight, this is looking like the start of a massive silver rally. Last time we saw this setup, silver skyrocketed to $50‚Äîso the potential here is huge. P.S. (Even if the feds manage to keep the dollar under control in the short-term for the fist time in history we are seeing the value of precious metals not being inversely affected by the USDIndex. This should be a strong indicator of what's about to happen.) My Call: Long and looking for a move to $35-$40/Oz.

Industrial Demand Continues to Surge Silver isn‚Äôt just a precious metal; it‚Äôs a critical component in various high-growth industries. According to the Silver Institute's 2024 World Silver Survey, industrial demand for silver is projected to reach 550 million ounces this year, a significant increase driven by its applications in electronics, solar energy, and electric vehicles. Electronics: Silver‚Äôs unparalleled electrical conductivity makes it indispensable in smartphones, laptops, and other consumer electronics. Solar Panels: With the global push towards renewable energy, silver‚Äôs role in photovoltaic cells ensures sustained demand. Electric Vehicles (EVs): The rise of EVs has boosted silver usage in batteries and other components, contributing to its demand surge. 2. Supply Constraints Intensify Despite increasing demand, silver production hasn‚Äôt kept pace. The World Silver Survey 2024 highlights a supply deficit of 80 million ounces this year. Key factors include: Mining Challenges: Several major silver mines have faced operational disruptions due to geopolitical tensions and environmental regulations. Limited New Projects: Investment in new silver mining projects remains low, causing a bottleneck in supply. 3. Investment Demand on the Rise Silver ETFs and other investment vehicles are witnessing renewed interest. Data from Bloomberg indicates that silver ETF inflows have increased by 15% in the first half of 2024. This uptick is fueled by: Affordability: Silver remains more accessible than gold, attracting retail investors looking for cost-effective entry points. Hedge Against Economic Uncertainty: Even as inflation rates stabilize, silver continues to serve as a hedge against market volatility and currency fluctuations. 4. Geopolitical Tensions and Safe Haven Appeal In times of geopolitical instability, investors flock to safe haven assets. Silver, like gold, benefits from this sentiment. The ongoing trade tensions between major economies and regional conflicts have heightened the demand for tangible assets that retain value amidst uncertainty. 5.

Industrial Demand Continues to Surge Silver isn‚Äôt just a precious metal; it‚Äôs a critical component in various high-growth industries. According to the Silver Institute's 2024 World Silver Survey, industrial demand for silver is projected to reach 550 million ounces this year, a significant increase driven by its applications in electronics, solar energy, and electric vehicles. Electronics: Silver‚Äôs unparalleled electrical conductivity makes it indispensable in smartphones, laptops, and other consumer electronics. Solar Panels: With the global push towards renewable energy, silver‚Äôs role in photovoltaic cells ensures sustained demand. Electric Vehicles (EVs): The rise of EVs has boosted silver usage in batteries and other components, contributing to its demand surge. 2. Supply Constraints Intensify Despite increasing demand, silver production hasn‚Äôt kept pace. The World Silver Survey 2024 highlights a supply deficit of 80 million ounces this year. Key factors include: Mining Challenges: Several major silver mines have faced operational disruptions due to geopolitical tensions and environmental regulations. Limited New Projects: Investment in new silver mining projects remains low, causing a bottleneck in supply. 3. Investment Demand on the Rise Silver ETFs and other investment vehicles are witnessing renewed interest. Data from Bloomberg indicates that silver ETF inflows have increased by 15% in the first half of 2024. This uptick is fueled by: Affordability: Silver remains more accessible than gold, attracting retail investors looking for cost-effective entry points. Hedge Against Economic Uncertainty: Even as inflation rates stabilize, silver continues to serve as a hedge against market volatility and currency fluctuations. 4. Geopolitical Tensions and Safe Haven Appeal In times of geopolitical instability, investors flock to safe haven assets. Silver, like gold, benefits from this sentiment. The ongoing trade tensions between major economies and regional conflicts have heightened the demand for tangible assets that retain value amidst uncertainty. 5. Technological Advancements Enhancing Silver‚Äôs Value Innovations in technology are expanding silver‚Äôs applications, further solidifying its status as a valuable asset. Breakthroughs in nanotechnology and medical devices are opening new avenues for silver usage, ensuring sustained and diversified demand. 6. Gold-to-Silver Ratio Indicates Undervaluation The gold-to-silver ratio is currently around 70:1, historically signalling that silver is undervalued relative to gold","Inflation is at 2.4%.

,"Silver Ounce/ U.S. Dollar, 4h Context: Silver apes, it‚Äôs happening. We just broke $33.68, and the charts are screaming bullish. This isn‚Äôt just your average end of week move; this is silver gearing up for something big. With inflation still out of control and central banks scrambling, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before silver shoots up even more. Here‚Äôs why I think we‚Äôre in for a massive run: Key Resistance Broken: We‚Äôve been watching the $32-32.5/Oz resistance for weeks (touched the resistance 5x and bounced back each time), and now that we‚Äôve smashed through it, we could easily be seeing silver charge to $35/Oz in no time. This is a breakout move that‚Äôs catching a lot of attention. Silver Demand is Heating Up: With its role in electronics and solar tech as well as a safe-haven asset, the demand for silver is surging. And supply? Still constrained. This imbalance means silver prices are set to keep climbing, especially with industrial demand keeping pressure on supply chains. Dollar Weakness: As the USD wobbles, silver gains strength. If the dollar stays weak, silver‚Äôs going to continue its upward trajectory. With $35 in sight, this is looking like the start of a massive silver rally. Last time we saw this setup, silver skyrocketed to $50‚Äîso the potential here is huge. P.S.

,"Silver Ounce/ U.S. Dollar, 4h Context: Silver apes, it‚Äôs happening. We just broke $33.68, and the charts are screaming bullish. This isn‚Äôt just your average end of week move; this is silver gearing up for something big. With inflation still out of control and central banks scrambling, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before silver shoots up even more. Here‚Äôs why I think we‚Äôre in for a massive run: Key Resistance Broken: We‚Äôve been watching the $32-32.5/Oz resistance for weeks (touched the resistance 5x and bounced back each time), and now that we‚Äôve smashed through it, we could easily be seeing silver charge to $35/Oz in no time. This is a breakout move that‚Äôs catching a lot of attention. Silver Demand is Heating Up: With its role in electronics and solar tech as well as a safe-haven asset, the demand for silver is surging. And supply? Still constrained. This imbalance means silver prices are set to keep climbing, especially with industrial demand keeping pressure on supply chains. Dollar Weakness: As the USD wobbles, silver gains strength. If the dollar stays weak, silver‚Äôs going to continue its upward trajectory. With $35 in sight, this is looking like the start of a massive silver rally. Last time we saw this setup, silver skyrocketed to $50‚Äîso the potential here is huge. P.S. (Even if the feds manage to keep the dollar under control in the short-term for the fist time in history we are seeing the value of precious metals not being inversely affected by the USDIndex. This should be a strong indicator of what's about to happen.) My Call: Long and looking for a move to $35-$40/Oz.

Industrial Demand Continues to Surge Silver isn‚Äôt just a precious metal; it‚Äôs a critical component in various high-growth industries. According to the Silver Institute's 2024 World Silver Survey, industrial demand for silver is projected to reach 550 million ounces this year, a significant increase driven by its applications in electronics, solar energy, and electric vehicles. Electronics: Silver‚Äôs unparalleled electrical conductivity makes it indispensable in smartphones, laptops, and other consumer electronics. Solar Panels: With the global push towards renewable energy, silver‚Äôs role in photovoltaic cells ensures sustained demand. Electric Vehicles (EVs): The rise of EVs has boosted silver usage in batteries and other components, contributing to its demand surge. 2. Supply Constraints Intensify Despite increasing demand, silver production hasn‚Äôt kept pace. The World Silver Survey 2024 highlights a supply deficit of 80 million ounces this year. Key factors include: Mining Challenges: Several major silver mines have faced operational disruptions due to geopolitical tensions and environmental regulations. Limited New Projects: Investment in new silver mining projects remains low, causing a bottleneck in supply. 3. Investment Demand on the Rise Silver ETFs and other investment vehicles are witnessing renewed interest. Data from Bloomberg indicates that silver ETF inflows have increased by 15% in the first half of 2024. This uptick is fueled by: Affordability: Silver remains more accessible than gold, attracting retail investors looking for cost-effective entry points. Hedge Against Economic Uncertainty: Even as inflation rates stabilize, silver continues to serve as a hedge against market volatility and currency fluctuations. 4. Geopolitical Tensions and Safe Haven Appeal In times of geopolitical instability, investors flock to safe haven assets. Silver, like gold, benefits from this sentiment. The ongoing trade tensions between major economies and regional conflicts have heightened the demand for tangible assets that retain value amidst uncertainty. 5.
