,"In a recent Wall Street survey, Google Cloud topped Microsoft (MSFT.O) and OpenAI as the “most strategic” AI vendor. Budget changes. As the holiday season approaches, technology procurement leaders at major enterprises are busy prioritizing their technology spending plans for 2025. These budget adjustments could signal potential changes in market share and spending direction. While OpenAI and Microsoft are getting a lot of attention in the AI space, a new CIO (chief information officer) survey shows that Alphabet (GOOGL.O) is rapidly coming into its own in the enterprise AI spending race. Piper Sandler's 2025 CIO Survey, which was released over the weekend, interviewed 81 CIOs about their budget priorities for different vendors and technology areas. “The tech industry will be dynamic in 2025,” Piper Sandler's analyst team writes, ”with generative AI transitioning from the testing/planning phase to implementation and driving growth in cloud spending.” Analysts noted that 87 percent of CIOs expect their IT budgets to increase in 2025, the highest percentage since the survey began in 2020. The popularity of Google Cloud increased significantly compared to the previous two surveys. In the “most strategic” AI vendor category, Google Cloud received 27 percent support, up from 15 percent six months ago. Meanwhile, Microsoft, the former leader, saw its support drop from 33% to 24%. Google Cloud also topped the ranking of AI infrastructure providers. When asked which cloud company they plan to test or implement AI projects with next year, 50 percent of respondents chose Google Cloud. Overall, this is good news for the major cloud infrastructure providers.The uptick in interest in AI applications and projects has led to higher spending intentions than six months ago for all providers, including Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). The trend has been equally favorable to the parent companies of these cloud companies - Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN.O), Alphabet and Oracle (ORCL.N). It's also a big plus for NVIDIA (NVDA.O), according to Harsh Kumar, a semiconductor analyst at Piper. All cloud companies are big customers of NVIDIA's AI chips. NVIDIA holds more than 70 percent of the AI GPU (graphics processing unit) market, according to analysts.Kumar expects the AI chip market to exceed $500 billion by 2028. If CIOs' budget plans come to fruition, 2025 will be a major growth year for AI. Investors are already picking up on the trend, with Alphabet's shares having risen nearly 15 percent this month. Personally, I think the short-term risk is high and the better strategy in the long run is to buy low","TLDRTicker: GOOGL (Alphabet/Google Cloud)Direction: UpPrognosis: Buy (long-term)Additional Insight: Google Cloud is beating Microsoft and OpenAI in a recent CIO survey for ""most strategic"" AI vendor, suggesting strong future growth.
