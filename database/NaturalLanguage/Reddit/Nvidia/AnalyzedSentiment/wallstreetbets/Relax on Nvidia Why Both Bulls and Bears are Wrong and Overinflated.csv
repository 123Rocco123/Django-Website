,"The short story for those who want a shorter read: Take a deep breath everyone and look at the bigger picture - not just today or even this month. Bulls on this reddit page seem to deny that the stock can go down more than 5% or 10% (it's healthy and normal) or don't look at how the market is doing overall that explains a lot of these swings. Bears on the other hand are in this perpetual nvidia is overvalued, the stock will drop below $100 to the extent that any time it drops - people freak out and we panic sell, then buy, then repeat. Relax and chill people - if you believe in Nvidia, chips, AI than just hold the stock and maybe look at some others in your portfolio like SoundHound or Palantir. I'm just trying to say we all do it but stop looking so much at what this stock is doing today, this week, or the stock has to drop because stocks usually don't do well in September - all of these matter much less to what the stock does a year, two, and five from now. Plus I get it stocks usually sell off in September, but it doesn't mean they have to have a bad month just like July or December don't have to be good (it's a pattern but patterns can and often are not always followed) The last couple months Nvidia has swung back and forth between around $90-$100 at the lowest points to around $130 at the highest. Each time, bulls have said it would go much higher. Bears on the other hand, have said that the stock has to go down because either it's overvalued, recession fears, September is usually bad for stocks, or because of other macroeconomic or geopolitical concerns. There have been way too many posts or comments like ""I just bought this stock, should I sell now"" or will the price go lower or higher in the next week or so. People are nervous and there's nothing wrong with that but that's part of the reason you're seeing these massive fluctuations is because Nvidia is so well known there are tons of people that want to trade it. That, and ever shifting media coverage that is either good or bad and the fact that whatever the market does - Nvidia amplifies that move because it's a growth stock. Long term I believe in Nvidia but short term really is anyone's guess. Unless someone traveled into the future with Marty and the Doc, you can't know what the stock will due short term. Sometimes you might be able to guess better than others but this is a great stock and company. Yes, it won't likely 10x from here but this is still a growing company. Plus, if you've held the stock from when it was around $100 pre split which wasn't a century ago, it will still go up big for you. That's because from here on out, every time the stock goes up $100 that's the same as going up $1000 pre split - it's just people don't think about it that way. Earlier this year, every time the stock went up $100 pre split it was a huge deal. Now that's the same as going up $10 which shows how crazy that is. I like the stock split for being on new investors - that's great - but it doesn't show the full extent of how much this stock has been swinging between full on bull or bear (we've been moving about $300 pre split but people don't see it that way because the stock split altered how people see it.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

There have been way too many posts or comments like ""I just bought this stock, should I sell now"" or will the price go lower or higher in the next week or so. People are nervous and there's nothing wrong with that but that's part of the reason you're seeing these massive fluctuations is because Nvidia is so well known there are tons of people that want to trade it. That, and ever shifting media coverage that is either good or bad and the fact that whatever the market does - Nvidia amplifies that move because it's a growth stock. Long term I believe in Nvidia but short term really is anyone's guess. Unless someone traveled into the future with Marty and the Doc, you can't know what the stock will due short term. Sometimes you might be able to guess better than others but this is a great stock and company. Yes, it won't likely 10x from here but this is still a growing company. Plus, if you've held the stock from when it was around $100 pre split which wasn't a century ago, it will still go up big for you. That's because from here on out, every time the stock goes up $100 that's the same as going up $1000 pre split - it's just people don't think about it that way. Earlier this year, every time the stock went up $100 pre split it was a huge deal. Now that's the same as going up $10 which shows how crazy that is. I like the stock split for being on new investors - that's great - but it doesn't show the full extent of how much this stock has been swinging between full on bull or bear (we've been moving about $300 pre split but people don't see it that way because the stock split altered how people see it.",ChatFPT?,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999
,"The short story for those who want a shorter read: Take a deep breath everyone and look at the bigger picture - not just today or even this month. Bulls on this reddit page seem to deny that the stock can go down more than 5% or 10% (it's healthy and normal) or don't look at how the market is doing overall that explains a lot of these swings. Bears on the other hand are in this perpetual nvidia is overvalued, the stock will drop below $100 to the extent that any time it drops - people freak out and we panic sell, then buy, then repeat. Relax and chill people - if you believe in Nvidia, chips, AI than just hold the stock and maybe look at some others in your portfolio like SoundHound or Palantir. I'm just trying to say we all do it but stop looking so much at what this stock is doing today, this week, or the stock has to drop because stocks usually don't do well in September - all of these matter much less to what the stock does a year, two, and five from now. Plus I get it stocks usually sell off in September, but it doesn't mean they have to have a bad month just like July or December don't have to be good (it's a pattern but patterns can and often are not always followed) The last couple months Nvidia has swung back and forth between around $90-$100 at the lowest points to around $130 at the highest. Each time, bulls have said it would go much higher. Bears on the other hand, have said that the stock has to go down because either it's overvalued, recession fears, September is usually bad for stocks, or because of other macroeconomic or geopolitical concerns.

They stand next to highway ramps with signs asking for money. I'm quite good at ignoring them.,0,0.559,NEGATIVE,0.996
