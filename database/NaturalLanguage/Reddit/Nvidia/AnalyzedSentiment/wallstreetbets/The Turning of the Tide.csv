,"Buy the rumor, sell the news. That's the saying. And sounds easy right? The hard part is simply remembering which rumor we're talking about. You might think the rumor is ""its gonna be 50bps"". But rumors have layers. And that is just a micro-rumor on the meta-rumor. For how many goddamn months have we been hearing the goddamn rumors about will they or won't they....get us off this plateau and lower interest rates. The rumor has been ""they will lower interest rates"" The ""news"" in the saying refers to the moment that rumor becomes fact. When it becomes history. Old news. Tomorrow is that day.

Yeah building housing is nice, but if you keep spending more to build it without removing money from the pile you just get more inflation. Every single avenue of spending has flown upwards towards the wealthy so if we print to spend more on housing they just get even more wealth. You have to remove money from the supply and the only way to do that is to tax the rich and redistribute what's out there already. If we keep printing and spending instead of taxing and spending the world gets worse for those without the capital to keep up.
