,"I believe that in the future, drugs will be highly customisable based on the patience’s health history. Based on your physiology, syndromes, and genetics, you may receive a drug that is well-suited for you and only you. How can you do that? First and foremost, you need data, huge amounts of it. We all know how generative and predictive models had advanced in the last year. It wasn’t in fact, until the launch of AlphaFold (by Google, whose team was recently awarded with the Chemistry Nobel Prize), that AI drug discovery became prominent. This open source model is used for molecular discovery. Again, would be nice if a company could: Generate proprietary synthetic, good quality molecular data using models like AlphaFold. Using this data to train models for drug discovery, reducing pipelines costs and times up to 50%. Eventually, with the possibility of bringing the first AI-aided drug to the market. First two points have been achieved, and the company is Recursion. We may know them because NVIDIA invested 50m in them. Why then are at ATL? I think the answer is time. We all know there is no room for patience when it comes to money sometimes. Training and bringing such results may take years. However, I think another catalyst is coming. On 9. December, they will host a seminar for new readouts in one of their most well-known drugs in development, CDK7, for advance solid tumours (an inhibitor, which are currently none approved by the FDA). Now, I am not saying that they will cure cancer - that’s BS. But over the years converging to novel oncological solutions using AI? This is not the only drug they have (other 9 are in development). They have more than 60 petabytes of data. They combined forces with Exscientia recently, forming probably the most important powerhouse of AI-drug research. They are extremely active in the research field (see their presence in the upcoming NeuRIPS conference) or their new open dataset for Quantum Computing (OpenQDC). I started investing in IONQ in 2021 for a similar impression. Now I am getting the same vibes with this. I feel that a small catalyst will put this to fly, although the real potencial will come in the next 5-10 years. If they can bring the first AI drug to the market, this implodes.

He thinks it's a nothing burger, should be evaluated on its pipeline like normal biotech, and none of the drugs in its pipeline are interesting. And he believes the use of Recursion OS etc. is marketing hype.But to be honest I think that's why Recursion is so undervalued because biotech people have been trained on survival and Recursion looks like a typical biotech hype and nothing burger play. However what is different this time is we are getting strong AI, eg. 2025 we get GPT5 and Microsoft's agent framework and so on, Agentic research assistants. Stronger models. Recursion is piggybacking on fundamental tech scaling laws. It's not the typical ML that everyone has already seen in Bio. Recursion is positioned basically to follow Kurzweil or any other scaling-law predictor. Same with Cathy Wood she is on the same train she thinks bio is about to hit tech scaling laws. That's the big narrative switch between biotech and techbio. And Recursion doesn' tneed 10 years to wait. They just need proof of accuracy and pipeline scaling which could easily happen before 2027. Just what I am thinking.There is also popular biotech idea that the big pharma companies can easily just contract out services like what Recursion has. But again, this is like thinking OpenAI can never gain traction against Google or whatever. Recursion has the 35th biggest supercomputer, increasing wet/dry lab, huge amounts of data, everything is set up to scale well. Again Shkreli goes back to all the costs being in clinical. If you really look at the fine print simulation drives down clinical by increasing accuracy of predictions. That's fundamental its a function of compute * data * algorithms. They are already using transformer models. IMO scaling is on an S curve for them.I should mention their open source models are already best in class. Which is remincscent of gpt2 ish.

Now, I am not saying that they will cure cancer - that’s BS. But over the years converging to novel oncological solutions using AI? This is not the only drug they have (other 9 are in development). They have more than 60 petabytes of data. They combined forces with Exscientia recently, forming probably the most important powerhouse of AI-drug research. They are extremely active in the research field (see their presence in the upcoming NeuRIPS conference) or their new open dataset for Quantum Computing (OpenQDC). I started investing in IONQ in 2021 for a similar impression. Now I am getting the same vibes with this. I feel that a small catalyst will put this to fly, although the real potencial will come in the next 5-10 years. If they can bring the first AI drug to the market, this implodes.

,"I believe that in the future, drugs will be highly customisable based on the patience’s health history. Based on your physiology, syndromes, and genetics, you may receive a drug that is well-suited for you and only you. How can you do that? First and foremost, you need data, huge amounts of it. We all know how generative and predictive models had advanced in the last year. It wasn’t in fact, until the launch of AlphaFold (by Google, whose team was recently awarded with the Chemistry Nobel Prize), that AI drug discovery became prominent. This open source model is used for molecular discovery. Again, would be nice if a company could: Generate proprietary synthetic, good quality molecular data using models like AlphaFold. Using this data to train models for drug discovery, reducing pipelines costs and times up to 50%. Eventually, with the possibility of bringing the first AI-aided drug to the market. First two points have been achieved, and the company is Recursion. We may know them because NVIDIA invested 50m in them. Why then are at ATL? I think the answer is time. We all know there is no room for patience when it comes to money sometimes. Training and bringing such results may take years. However, I think another catalyst is coming. On 9. December, they will host a seminar for new readouts in one of their most well-known drugs in development, CDK7, for advance solid tumours (an inhibitor, which are currently none approved by the FDA).
