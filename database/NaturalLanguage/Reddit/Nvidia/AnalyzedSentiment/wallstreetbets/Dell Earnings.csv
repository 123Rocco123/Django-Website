,"I wanted to get everyone’s take on DELL (down nearly 11% after hours.) I bought 106 shares at 130.5 during their recent run. Didn’t sell today because I like their growth prospects wanted to exit around $150. The company seems solid, especially with its strength in enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure, even though consumer PC sales have been an ongoing problem. Despite this Dell has been doubling down on AI, data centers, and hybrid cloud, which I believe should set them up well for growth in 2025. They also stand to benefit from SMCI’s issues and Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure. With the growing focus on AI and enterprise tech, it feels like Dell could see steady, long-term growth and break out to that $150 range by Q2 2024. Thoughts? Should I continue to hold? Or sell during the holiday rally? My portfolio time horizon is short giving I plan to liquidate July 2024 to buy a house.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

Sorry, if this comes across as arrogant (I am a rather arrogant person unfortunately and very much unqualified to advise at anything) but you are not even in the same region for the right question. If you are planning to buy a house and the money in your portfolio is part of financing it, you should not ask, if the stock might go up or down, but how much risk can you afford to take, because it can either go up or down. Nothing you say in your post matters for that.Please get comprehensive professional financial advise (you need that for buying your house anyway), take your wife with you and let her make the decision.
