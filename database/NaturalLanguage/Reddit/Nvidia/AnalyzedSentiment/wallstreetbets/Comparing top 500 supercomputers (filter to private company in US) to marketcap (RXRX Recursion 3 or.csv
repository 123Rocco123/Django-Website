,"This scatter plot shows how much computational power companies have in relation to their market value. The term R.max stands for maximum computational performance, measured in petaflops per second (PFlop/s). Essentially, R.max represents how fast and powerful the computing resources of a company can be. The key measure on the chart is R.max per Market Cap—something I just invented that tells us how something about its investment into computing relative to its size. Directly itt answers the question: ""How much computing power does each billion dollars of a company's value represent?"" Recursion Pharmaceuticals is 1 to 3 orders of magnitude higher in R.max per Market Cap compared to most other companies on the list, depending on which specific company you compare it to. An interesting second is HPE, well its mostly there because its supercomputer is just really massive and its spread across many sectors. Everything else more or less Next question is why did I look at this? Well I have been wondering about Recursion lately and wanted to see what its supercomputer really looked like relative to industry peers. I wanted to find companies that were under 10B market cap and had a supercomputer that dominated their sector. IMO I couldn't really find anything else. I think this is an interesting metric though.... Let me know what you think. Also what do you think about that trend line.",TLDRTicker: RXRXDirection: UpPrognosis: BuyReason: Recursion Pharmaceuticals is massively over-performing in computational power relative to its market cap.

I took the top 500 supercomputers from the top 500 list and filtered for US, investable etc.I did this because I wanted to find companies similar to recursion (leading supercomputer in their sector) as a market hypothesis I had. And the I saw how unique rxrx actually was in this regards and shared a chart that probably few people have thought to make before.Honestly if you think this is really bullish for recursion that's cool. But even I am skeptical in that regards however I do think it's interesting...If you think it would be interesting to combine supercomputers that one company has I agree that may be interesting to see as well if it has some kind of magnitudinal impact to the scores not sure.",3,0.537,NEGATIVE,0.84,0.537,0.84

People have not caught on that pharma is informational. I agree most of their value comes from drug pipeline. In that regards I watched all of 2024 download day and everything to me shows clear indication of accelerating returns due to their leadership believing the future of their company is in information and intelligence generation rather than simply for drug discovery.
