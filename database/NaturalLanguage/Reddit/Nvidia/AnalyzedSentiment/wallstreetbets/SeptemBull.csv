,I’m regarded and I think my first post got removed. I’ve been swing trading my Roth IRA for the past month. This account is 100% gains. I’ve removed my contributions tax and penalty free. Recent large wins include a big NVDA weekly play last Monday to Wednesday. $2k to $22k. I closed 95 of them at 10am on Wednesday and held the rest until Friday. Then I’ve just been scalping SPY 1 DTE options with high volume. 100 calls at a time. Monday 9/30 I held and kept buying in 100 contract lots spy calls. And sold right before close for a +$25k swing. It hasn’t been all wins. I’ve let thousands in contract expire worthless. Planning to chill for a bit. Wait for the strikes to end. Maybe.,GPT-REEEE,0,,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

Did have one question, however.RE: ""I’ve removed my contributions tax and penalty free.""I get that you can do that at any point but why?100% would understand profit taking in a taxable account or on any WSB style investment but why not just keep that in there and do some more traditional investing with that portion? Heck even if I needed cash quick I'd tap other things before the Roth.",0,,0.517,NEGATIVE,0.998

But this account was started in December of ‘21. I immediately contributed $6k. In Jan of ‘22 another ~4k. Invested entirely in nvda shares. That became worth roughy $4500 by sept due to tech coming down to earth. I held and contributed another $2k towards more NVDA shares.I rode the wave up to $40k spring of 2024. Never contributing anything further.This account only ever had at most $12k in contributions in it. And really that money was supposed to be extra emergency fund storage. Which it turned out I needed. So I took it out. I have other retirement / HSA / IRA funds that are invested very traditionally. I should probably increase my cash on hand outside of those accounts.TL;DR - This is not my only tax advantages account. And because I’m regarded.,1,,0.513,NEGATIVE,1.0
