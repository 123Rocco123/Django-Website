,"Hi all, I’m looking for some guidance from experienced investors on hedging strategies. I’ve been fortunate to see good gains with my investment in NVIDIA, but with the market’s recent volatility, I’m considering ways to protect those gains through hedging. Here’s my situation: My entire position is in NVIDIA, which has been highly correlated with the NASDAQ’s movements. I’ve read that inverse ETFs, especially leveraged ones like SQQQ, can be effective in offsetting downturns in the NASDAQ. However, I’m not entirely sure how to use them in a capital-efficient way while avoiding potential pitfalls with inverse and leveraged ETFs. I’d appreciate advice on: Calculating the appropriate amount of an inverse ETF to buy relative to my NVIDIA position. Using leveraged inverse ETFs as a short-term hedge without exposing myself to excessive risks. Any alternative hedging strategies that might suit my situation better, especially since I’m based in the EU and not all ETFs are available on DEGIRO. Any insights or recommendations would be hugely appreciated! I want to make smart moves to safeguard my gains, so thanks in advance for any guidance you can share.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999,0.5,0.999
