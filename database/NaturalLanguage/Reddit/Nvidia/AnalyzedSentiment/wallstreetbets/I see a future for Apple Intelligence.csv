Apple's stock price hit a new high today","Apple intelligence is crap right now. But Apple, while late to the game, has time to improve. In the long run, Apple will win because its customers often store all their data with Apple. They have multiple devices with Apple. I find myself sometimes using Apple Intelligence even though I know itâ€™s crap, and will often prompt me to ask ChatGPT anyway. I do it because itâ€™s convenient and already there on my MacBook, iPad and iPhone. Apple does have to be the best right out of the gate, in the long run it may not even need to be the best. It might just need to be good enough to win.Big winner in AI will be the companies that hold data and can use that data to create value. For me, that will be companies like Apple (consumer data), Salesforce (business data).",0,0.541,POSITIVE,0.966
