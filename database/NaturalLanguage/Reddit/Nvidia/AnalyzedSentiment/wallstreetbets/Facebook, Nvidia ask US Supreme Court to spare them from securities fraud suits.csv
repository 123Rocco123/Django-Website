,,"So I know Supreme Court decisions are goal-seeked and backsolved and the actual law doesn't matter. But I would love to know what legal arguments Facebook and NVidia are trying to use here.Scalia famously went for the ""corporations are people"" argument in Citizens United. So in that case, isn't a class-action lawsuit against a Big Tech company just one large group of people acting as a collective, suing another large group of people acting as a collective?

,,"I appreciate that link.So the question isn't about standing like I thought.

,,"The basic premise is that under current law (or lack of) every negative thing that happens to a company can be viewed as securities fraud, and many company‚Äôs are inundated by civil suits that don‚Äôt hold merit.  An example would be Elon Musk tweeting on his personal account while being the CEO of a public company. Is his private behavior which negatively affects the company and causing harm to shareholders considered securities fraud?
