,nan,"Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. ""$30 is $30"", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies.

,nan,"What will happen is, in 5 years or 10 years, they are not in a hurry",1,0.535,NEGATIVE,0.985
,nan,"In 5-10 years their competitors will be that much more ahead. Each generation of these kinds of chips depends on the last one, so an early advantage can grow exponentially as time goes on.",2,0.537,POSITIVE,0.999
,nan,"Not really, if that were the case Intel would be untouchable in the CPU space but what actually happened is AMD caught up and surpassed them.The cycles are long, but the opportunity is too big for competitors not to catch up. NVDA enjoys a ridiculous margin on their chips right now - in a few years someone will make something 80% as good for 50% of the price which sell like hotcakes and force NVDA to slash their margins, and at some point someone will reach parity.",3,0.531,POSITIVE,0.827
,nan,"The reason AMD caught up is because it was profitable for Intel to sit on their ass and make 4 core 12+ nm chips as otherwise they'd have to upgrade their own factories which is hugely expensive (those factories currently lose them billions), so they were competing against an opponent who faked a cold so that they can lie in their bed all day playing videogames.Sure China will undoubtedly catch up but they'll do that by copying Hong Kong's factories when they finally get the chance and not by innovating like AMD did.",4,0.531,NEGATIVE,1.0
,nan,"I don't disagree on your assessment of Intel, but NVDA is subject to similar incentives. With a defacto monopoly on high-end AI chips, they're not really incentivized to push the envelope or innovate. The most profitable strategy for them is to keep dolling out incremental updates to keep giving clients a reason to upgrade, but holding back on anything which could decrease margins, and always saving something for the next generationIt's inevitable for monopolies to shift away from innovation and towards safe profit maximization. Just look at Google - they had a huge lead in AI and created basically all the critical IP which makes LLM's possible. But they make so much money of search they didn't want to cannibalize, that they didn't bother productizing this tech and used it for glorified autocomplete on gmailBut if you can think of an example of a market leader in any industry which got a lead and stayed dominant forever with huge margins I am all ears",5,0.524,NEGATIVE,0.996
,nan,"what actually happened is AMD caught up and surpassed them.Much of that is thanks to TSMC though, not architecture. Intel has already closed the gap in the mobile space when it comes to efficiency thanks to also being on the same node as AMD. Their architecture was never the main issue, it was their fabs being 1 node behind (2 at times if we talk vs Apple).Why is this relevant? Because Chinese GPU manufacturers going into the AI space. Will undoubtedly be barred from using TSMC leading edge nodes.So even if they sort out a good architecture, they are at a dead end without access to EUV nodes.",4,0.544,NEGATIVE,0.999
,nan,"They‚Äòre also working on the EUV tech in parallel. I‚Äòve seen this ‚Äûthey‚Äòll never catch up, our lead is much too big and they aren‚Äòt smart enough‚Äú argument in soo many industries that ended up getting punched in the face‚Ä¶ the car manufacturers are currently in that stage.",5,0.521,NEGATIVE,0.995

,nan,"Originally it was designs lower than 16/14 nm. Nvida tweaked some designs before 2022/2023 to be above those standards, so the US government changed it to a performance threshold.
