,nan,"There is no chance for BTC. Big companies already own 99%. And other companies who didn't buy early won't accept this fantasy currency. Why would they? They can make their own at any time. Every time I see ""MSTR raised xx billions to buy BTC"" makes me chuckle. The downfall of crypto will be amazing to witness. The question is - will it begin with loss of interest (due to the reason I mentioned) or the fall of a major player like Tether (which is the biggest financial fraud we've seen and the only reason BTC is priced as it is). This doesn't mean there isn't money to be made before it happens.",3,0.524,NEGATIVE,0.999
