,"Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger recently did an in-depth interview with Goldman Sachs, in which he shared a lot of insight of Intel current and upcoming progress. ( you can watch it full here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhWJ3CDt2-w ) I'll highlight some very interesting insights: Intel 18A process, the fifth and final node in ""Five Nodes in Four Years"" promise, is now finalized, 1.0 Process Design Kit (PDK) sent to customers in July. And mass production starts before the end of the year. First products will be Panther Lake (client) and Clearwater Forest (server) in 2025. The process yield is healthy (with Defect Density below 0.4). In phase one they were aggressive in pushing the company to compete (with TSMC and others), he now announced they are moving to the second phase, becoming profitable. Intel is working on cost-efficiency and nimble operations (aka milking every cent out of all those multi-billion investments). Pat also revealed that Intel Foundry (18A node) has 12 active customer engagements and 8 product tape-ins expected by 2025. We know that both Microsoft and Amazon have officially announced switching to using Intel 18A for their upcoming custom AI chips, that leaves 10 mysterious customers ( there has been rumors of NVIDIA & Qualcomm so far). Talked about cost reduction strategy (15,000 Layoffs and $10 Billion in savings). There is strong demand on Intel advanced packaging products (EMIB & Foveros). And for those who don't know, just like TSMC's CoWoS, there is insane demand in packaging segment right now (and in many cases it's the bottleneck for AI chip production, along with HBM memory) In phone call with SEC of Department of Commerce, said, they are lamenting that people aren't more concerned about the supply resilience after the COVID chip shortage shock, and there is a need to diversify their supply chains away from Asia.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999
