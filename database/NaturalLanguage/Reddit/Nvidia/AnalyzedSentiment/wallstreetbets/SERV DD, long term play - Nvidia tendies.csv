,"Sharing some of my own recent DD, found SERV only 5 days ago and have gone down the rabbit hole. Conservatively estimating 200-1000% in the next 2 years, much greater if next year is successful. Institutions are going to like this stock. Market cap 560M Consistent uptrend after major buying in late July after Nvidia investment announced. People like Jensen Huang tendies. Summary - Leading autonomous / AI robotics company with a proven team having gotten through an alpha test with their early round of deliveries and is now expanding in 2026 with 2000 more units to scale. Lower cost than using a car and reduces strain on streets and parking. Exploring other robotics areas to build products in (think Starbucks, McDonald’s, etc) Major brand names investing and partnering with SERV. Investors, Integration and News - Invested in by Nvidia (likely getting internal tech support) Already integrated with Uber and 7-11 Recent events - October - Partnered with wing.com (alphabet / google venture). Serv will drop packages to wing for pickup and delivery’s. The ground game of autonomous delivery chain. November - acquired Vebu full stack restaurant automation allowing them to build offerings outside of delivery (Starbucks, McDonald’s) Future - 2026 plan to deploy 2000 more units in progress. Revenue or Total Addressable Market - massive, if you see the vision and they’re able to execute next year you’re buying a leader massive market potential. Ali has stated these numbers I believe at 20 million deliveries a day, half of which are walking distance so 10 million a day in the US alone. 20-50 Million $ a day in delivery fees up for grabs in the US alone. These fees will likely be lower than a driver (at first) prompting people to use the service. They hope to turn 60-80 million next year from 2000 robots but if they get nowhere near that, the potential is there with other gains they will make advancing the product and getting out the kinks. Once critical mass is reached and consumers accept these in an area you could imagine them running 24/7 moving things. We are in the future. Leader - with Nvidia, a working product that is expanding and weak competitors (e.g competitors drive their robots while serv will operate automously) expect Serv is well positioned to come out as a leader in the US autonomous delivery and restaurant automation. Design - care for aesthetics and design with the eyes / wall-e / shopping cart design, needed to make people feel comfortable with the future. Institutions - started onboarding immediately and expect this to pick up heavily, and into next year with support of Nvidia and partnership with wing. heavy buying volume from late July. After cool off has been in constant uptrend from September and edging higher. Costs - Robot build prices will come down with economies of scale. Other Benefits - Research and Development in this robotics area poises them for additional spinoffs or pivots into new businesses or government contracts.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999
