The corruption in the market does not care for rules. Those are just for me, and you lol. $NVDIA is an example of that when you know a lot of it is owned by 4 billionaires. The fact that they are in talks with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, who, let's be honest, have enormous connections and are known crooks. Also, geo politically, we don't know what will happen after the elections. Intel is 75% USA made, so if something pops in Asia or the whole russia china coalition, we still have homemade stuff, which is $INTC. Also, $INTC is the best on board CPU for autonomous robots, and that market is expected to grow significantly in the next few years. $TSLA and Amazon are already on it, and so is china.
