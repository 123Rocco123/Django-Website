,nan,"Market value: the total value of all his holding, in this case 100% equity. This is what all his stocks are worth if he sells right now for market price.Net account value: the actual value of his account. Market value and the loan he took from his broker to purchase these equity. Most likely, he had some money in the account, then requested margin and used borrowed money to buy more stocks.Not sure why though. The interest on margin is pretty high.",3,0.56,POSITIVE,0.896
,nan,"Why‚Äôs it show negative, why does it even allow you to do that?",2,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999
,nan,"When you buy stocks or options using margin, your balance will show as a negative number which isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing. It just shows how much money you need to either deposit or earn from trades that‚Äôll lower that balance number. Because when you buy using margin, you‚Äôre borrowing money from the brokerage and you have to pay it back. If you‚Äôre smart with it then using margin is actually pretty helpful",3,0.511,NEGATIVE,0.97
,nan,Being in debt is a terrible idea. The entire point of investing is to be independent imo lol,4,0.504,NEGATIVE,0.998
,nan,The whole point of margin is to increase the profit you make from a stock going up. I think it‚Äôs fine especially if you‚Äôre buying into a good company and plan on holding the shares for a long time. You can also write off the interest you accrue on your tax returns and if you really wanna get fancy you can 50 shares of a stock and buy another 50 shares on margin and sell a covered call every week and it would pay down the margin balance for you instead of using your own money üòèüòé,5,0.567,NEGATIVE,0.888
