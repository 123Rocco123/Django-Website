Since the industry is moving so faster with computing power, it seems it is not very simple to just build a new PSU that meets 80 PLUS Titanium rating.The hurdle with these companies is the long period of design time to switch from traditional silicon to GaN. Switching to GaN requires circuity re-engineering I believe for customers who want to adopt it. That is one reason why the design/dev time to adopt GaN is so long when switching from traditional silicon. That is why most of these companies that specialize in this are very long-term plays because it's going to take awhile.Navitas Overcomes AI Challenges with World’s Highest Power Density Data Center Design | Navitas (navitassemi.com)ON is down is 14% past 6 monthsNVTS is down 51% past 6 months",1,0.542,NEGATIVE,0.998

Nvidia has had an incredibly consistent road map for their chips over the last decade plus - and if you look at a lot of their published research over the same time span it's clear they were ""preparing"" for the accelerated computing ""revolution"" for decades, ML has been their bread and butter forever. Trying to quickly build what Nvidia has spent decades researching and developing is probably impossible. CUDA isn't going away anytime soon. It has embedded itself into every single field that uses any GPU acceleration at all (which is basically all of them, from hard sciences/research fields to engineering to visual effects work/CGI, AI obviously and anything else in between).I'm just some dude, so don't take my word for it but if I had to guess AWS and Azure are going to be buying Nvidia products for a long time... Regardless of what they might say. Their ASICs will come, but when will they outperform? Google is maybe the most well positioned to provide the quickest competition to Nvidia as they've been building their TPU infra for a while now and tensorflow is relatively established - but there's still a lot of work to do even for them and they'll continue to buy Nvidia because at the end of the day they still need the highest available performance for the highest number of tasks. I can't speak to IBM or Oracle but I imagine it's much the same as Amazon and Microsoft. Apple seems like they're content using their own chips internally but I also don't know how much they want to expand their cloud computing services.Competition will come, and to a degree it already exists - but Nvidia is going to be king for a while I think.

Nvidia makes TPUs as well, they just embed them in their GPUs to get the best general performance right now. Hell if you go with Grace hopper you get a cute little CPU too.

In the 1950s it all started with massive computers that needed to be housed in big buildings. Vacuum tubes were coming of age and it was just about possible to build computers using vacuum tubes.Today we're seeing something similar with microprocessors and AI. Microprocessors are coming of age, we're reaching the end of the line with miniaturizing and building massive systems that can just about function as a useful AI tool.Now the AI revolution is still in its early stages, but it's then likely that microprocessors will be ditched in favor of new technology. We know that AI can be implemented in a much more efficient way than we're doing it at present because Nature has been doing that for 750 million years, and if we mimic how Nature goes about this, we get far better results:https://sci-hub.se/10.1038/s42256-020-00237-3We develop compact representations called neural circuit policies (NCPs), where each neuron has increased computational capabilities compared with contemporary deep models. We show that NCPs lead to sparse networks that are more easily interpretable and demonstrate this in the context of autonomous driving.We discovered that for the lane-keeping task mentioned above, very small networks of brain-inspired neural models (that is, networks with a control compartment consisting of only 19 neurons), in combination with compact convolutional neural networks (CNNs), achieved superior performance, compared with state-of-the-art models, in learning how to steer a vehicle directly from high-dimensional inputs. Here we use the representation-learning challenges as the main criteria for assessing the performance of autonomous-control agents.The network structure of NCPs is inspired by the wiring diagram of the C. elegans nematode. Many neural circuits within the nematode’s nervous system are constructed by a distinct four-layer hierarchical network topology. They receive environmental observations through sensory neurons. These are passed on to inter-neurons and command neurons, which generate an output decision.Finally, this decision is passed to the motor neurons to actuate its muscles. The wiring diagram of C. elegans achieves a sparsity of around 90% (ref. 6), with predominantly feedforward connections from sen sors to intermediate neurons, highly recurrent connections among inter-neurons and command neurons, and feedforward connections from command neurons to motor neurons.This specific topology was shown to have attractive computational advantages, such as, efficient distributed control, requiring a small number of neurons6, hierarchical temporal dynamics, robot-learning capabilities and maximal information propagation in sparse-flow networks.",0,0.521,POSITIVE,0.934

While this is quite in the early stage, I stronly feel this would happen at some point. So, relying on GPU sales may not really make it a nine inning game. Probably will saturate much before that.
