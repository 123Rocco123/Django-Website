,,"A year ago they weren't really even a contender. Now their GPT model is one of the best. Zuck recently said that by the end of 2024 their model would be the most popular one, so perhaps they have some release coming up. They also have really solid AR/VR stuff.",3,0.58,POSITIVE,0.999

,,More and more it becomes obvious how google got away like bandits when they bought deepmind. Everyone now needs to partially invest due to anti trust meanwhile google is all in house.,0,0.506,NEGATIVE,0.999
,,Not sure you can compare Deepmind (when Google bought them) and OpenAI. It took DeepMind + Google 10 years after acquisition to launch Gemini.And OpenAI being its own entity makes it iterate and launch much faster than opposed to fully owned by Microsoft for example.,1,0.522,POSITIVE,0.999
,,openAI use the research published by deepmind. They catch up about 80% in one year. I don't think they have a talent issue but rather a management focus issue. And google is pretty well known for killing off their own projects on a consistent basis. Honestly they just have issue carry project through before jumping on the next shinning thing.,2,0.546,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,OpenAI built their chatbot on all the research deepmind put out also it took openAI 4 years to get chatgpt4 and it took google one year to start from scratch to catch up so i fail to see how “it took 10 years to launch gemini” is an argument for anything especially since deepmind wasn’t focused on chatbots but other areas of AI like alphafold.Also openAI being its own entity prevents it to scale as fast as google can which prevents it to launch anything faster due to cost.,2,0.537,NEGATIVE,1.0
,,"My point is Deepmind was a research lab without a product when Google bought them. And it took 10 years of R&D + Google money/resources before they can monetize with Gemini.Deepmind was a talent acquisition, compared to Meta who fully developed LLama in-house.Imagine if Apple bought Deepmind 10 years ago, it probably be like Siri or got cancelled.",3,0.516,NEGATIVE,0.998
