,"NVDA's next-generation Blackwell AI chips had serious overheating issues in high-capacity server racks. These issues have led to design adjustments and program delays, leaving major customers such as Google, Meta and Microsoft concerned about being able to deploy Blackwell servers as planned. Blackwell GPUs, designed for AI and high-performance computing (HPC), experienced overheating issues in servers configured with 72 processors, which can consume up to 120 kilowatts of power per rack. The overheating issue forced NVIDIA to modify the rack design several times, which not only limited GPU performance but also potentially damaged the hardware. Customers were concerned that these technical issues were delaying processor deployments in data centers. To address this challenge, NVIDIA asked suppliers to adjust rack designs and worked with partners to optimize cooling systems. While such engineering improvements are a routine step in large-scale technology releases, they also further delayed product delivery. I think the overheating issues with the Blackwell chips reflect the technical complexities and challenges in the development of advanced AI hardware, but NVIDIA is responding to these issues with design adjustments and enhanced collaboration. While the delays may have some negative impact on customers and NVIDIA's results in the short term, the Blackwell chips are still expected to be a significant driver of the AI and HPC markets as optimizations are completed and products are shipped at scale.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999,0.5,0.999

Blackwell is for AI not gaming. Heating issues rumours are due to physical server configurations not a custom loop or thermal paste and unless nvidia has addressed it publicly or ive missed some announcements it is still a rumour started by a small tech company who if they have some units might not of read the part where nvidia advised Blackwell needs a better then standard server rack.This kind of FUD came out last ER aswell.Also I'm holding long term and that's for the AI not the 50 series which will be a stupid price leaving most of the gaming market priced out imo",4,0.562,NEGATIVE,1.0,0.562,1.0

,"NVDA's next-generation Blackwell AI chips had serious overheating issues in high-capacity server racks. These issues have led to design adjustments and program delays, leaving major customers such as Google, Meta and Microsoft concerned about being able to deploy Blackwell servers as planned. Blackwell GPUs, designed for AI and high-performance computing (HPC), experienced overheating issues in servers configured with 72 processors, which can consume up to 120 kilowatts of power per rack. The overheating issue forced NVIDIA to modify the rack design several times, which not only limited GPU performance but also potentially damaged the hardware. Customers were concerned that these technical issues were delaying processor deployments in data centers. To address this challenge, NVIDIA asked suppliers to adjust rack designs and worked with partners to optimize cooling systems.
