,"Recently I have been concerned about the dramatic changes in the chip industry, particularly the impact of the explosion in demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips.25 years ago, Intel represented tech companies in the Dow Jones, and today, NVIDIA's shares have soared seven-fold, taking Intel's place as the new blue-chip stock. This shows that the industry's focus has shifted from traditional needs to AI applications. There are three main challenges in the industry. First, most chip companies are lagging behind NVIDIA in designing and producing AI chips, with longer lead times as standards improve. Second, Intel is lagging behind TSMC and SK Hynix due to manufacturing delays and underinvestment, especially in the high-end chip market where TSMC's share is even 62%. Finally, high-end AI chips have much higher profit margins than traditional chips, which exacerbates the trend of “winner-take-all”, such as TSMC and SK Hynix's profits and share price have risen sharply, while Samsung and Intel look weak due to poor profits. I think in today's AI world dominated by Nvidia, global chipmakers may have no choice but to join Nvidia's supply chain if they can't catch up technologically.",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999,0.5,0.999
