,,"Thanks for sharing. It's this analysis and insight that's really great and helps lots of us. To see fundamentals can pay off. You saw a trend, bet with it, and it paid off. That said, I have been watching Compass. (COMP) just trying to see if there's a same pattern. If the pattern holds, it should break out for the next 2-4 days. (this is day 1) Then slowly consolidate down. Could go in for a quick uptick for 2-4 day then exit. Or, do a call followed by a put.",4,,0.531,NEGATIVE,0.597
