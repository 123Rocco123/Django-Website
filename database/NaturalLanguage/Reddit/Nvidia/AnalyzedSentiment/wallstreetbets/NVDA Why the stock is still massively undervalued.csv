,"NVDA stock closed at 148.31$ on 12th November, 2024. With the influx of AI chips is all electronic and home appliances, demand for NVDA latest offerings are going to stay strong till the end of this decade. Some of the applications of AI chips: LLM Training Models Data Centers Cloud Computing Enterprise computer systems Home computers Cars (latest EV and IC models) Smart phones Home appliances (televisions, refrigerator, washing machine, micro wave, oven-toaster-griller etc) Home security systems & door locks Home bots Industrial robots Medicine and industry Aircrafts and in airlines operations Shipping Minning Inventory Management Tools Police and Homeland Security Cameras (Digital hand held, security camera etc) Digital Wear (smart watches, smart glass etc) Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality/Metaverse The AI chip market is likely to explode from some 130 B$ market in 2025 to 500 B$ by end of 2029. Some research publications are pegging the AI chip market size estimate at 300 B$ by 2029, which in my opinion is too small considering the ever widening adoption of AI chip embedded products within industries, corporations, and households. If AI chip market reaches 500 B$ by 2029 then this will mark a 3.85X increase in the size of the pie, with major chunk [baring any breakthrough by a competition] falling in the laps on Nvidia. Charitably, let us say that NVDA is able to corner only 60% of the market in 2029 [from current 90%], that would mean annual revenue of 300 B$. Say profit margins drop from current 60% to only 40% by 2029, this translates to 120B$ in annual profits. Based on a reasonable P/E ratio of 40 [current is 69], the stock price by 2029 should be at staggering 343$ per share. How to Trade?

,"NVDA stock closed at 148.31$ on 12th November, 2024. With the influx of AI chips is all electronic and home appliances, demand for NVDA latest offerings are going to stay strong till the end of this decade. Some of the applications of AI chips: LLM Training Models Data Centers Cloud Computing Enterprise computer systems Home computers Cars (latest EV and IC models) Smart phones Home appliances (televisions, refrigerator, washing machine, micro wave, oven-toaster-griller etc) Home security systems & door locks Home bots Industrial robots Medicine and industry Aircrafts and in airlines operations Shipping Minning Inventory Management Tools Police and Homeland Security Cameras (Digital hand held, security camera etc) Digital Wear (smart watches, smart glass etc) Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality/Metaverse The AI chip market is likely to explode from some 130 B$ market in 2025 to 500 B$ by end of 2029. Some research publications are pegging the AI chip market size estimate at 300 B$ by 2029, which in my opinion is too small considering the ever widening adoption of AI chip embedded products within industries, corporations, and households. If AI chip market reaches 500 B$ by 2029 then this will mark a 3.85X increase in the size of the pie, with major chunk [baring any breakthrough by a competition] falling in the laps on Nvidia. Charitably, let us say that NVDA is able to corner only 60% of the market in 2029 [from current 90%], that would mean annual revenue of 300 B$. Say profit margins drop from current 60% to only 40% by 2029, this translates to 120B$ in annual profits. Based on a reasonable P/E ratio of 40 [current is 69], the stock price by 2029 should be at staggering 343$ per share. How to Trade?
