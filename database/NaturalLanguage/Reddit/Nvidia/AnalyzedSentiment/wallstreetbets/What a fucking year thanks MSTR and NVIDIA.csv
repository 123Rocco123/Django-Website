Being in large corporate IT you try and exist somewhere in the middle, in between the hollow cogs all your peers have become, and the others who simply don't give a shit and are 100% checked out... but balancing this long term will kill you.That was my experience anyway and why I got out as soon as financially able, I can 100% relate to OP.
