,Started off investing in 2020 held out throughout the dip and made a bit of money first spike was from crypto and second was from nvidia options. Things got bad quickly and stress started to increase so i got into 0dte QQQ to make things worse and lost 10k yesterday I don’t know why I went back in after losing 23k total but I just had to make it back went in this morning all in and made 20k back still down 3k. It’s been a roller coaster and I’m just glad I’m only down 3k. Don’t do options and if you are anyway because you have a couple extra dollars like me just stay the fuck away from putting large amounts on 0dte a couple hundred dollars sure why not it’s not much different than lotto tickets. I seriously hope that I’ve learned something from this. Point of making this post is a reminder for myself of how options can ruin what took years to save up I’m 24 years old so I’m sure I would have recovered but this shit was not fun just straight up gambling addiction. Anyway see you guys on Monday!,GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

It was mindbogfling stupid and almost lost everything after the stock buyback announcement.The only thing that saved me was MIcrosoft earning at the same day that nuked GOOGL price. Sold the next day for 10% and NEVER did anything like it again.,0,0.534,NEGATIVE,1.0
