,"Insiders had a very good long run with the NVDA, now they feel it’s very uncertain or over-valued. Sell large part to basically diversify",Insiders are typically net sellers because a chunk of their comp is in shares and there are many reasons that people need cash. Insiders sales don’t have much correlation with share price increase or decreases.Share purchases by insiders does have a positive correlation with future share price because there is only 1 reason to buy,0,0.579,NEGATIVE,0.79
,"Insiders had a very good long run with the NVDA, now they feel it’s very uncertain or over-valued. Sell large part to basically diversify",Everything is baked into the stock by the way Jensen he sold last year but it doesn't get the attention because the stock continued to trade higher throughout the week the month the quarter and the calendar year and the dollar amount that he sold is but a fraction of what it is this year because the stock is significantly higher this year relative to last year in June. Feel any need to look beyond the riff Raff and look at the big picture. All of these Wall Street bobblehead analysts on TV keep saying AI is in a bubble and these are the same people that don't own a single share of any tech stock for the past year. I've got to believe that they're losing clients everyday because the returns of their portfolios pale in comparison to the companies that they talk down about. You have AMD CEO Lisa coming out talking about the insatiable demand you have yesterday micron knocking the cover off the ball they are 100% presold for everything that's manufactured in 2025 you have Jensen coming out that has so much demand for their existing gpus and next year Blackwell that everybody is on allocation meaning they're 100% pre-sold out also. At what point do you listen to the CEOs that run the companies because the people on TV the bobbleheads are useless idiots at the end of the day and they are the ones that almost 90% of their group these so-called experts they lag the S&P 500 in terms of Total return on an annual basis and a cumulative basis so why listen to people that can't even equal a basket of diversified stocks.,0,0.575,NEGATIVE,1.0
