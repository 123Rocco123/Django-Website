,"The Financial times Lex with some fun facts on NVIDIA stock market dominance and what is much different about it compared to former market darling Cisco Nvidia‚Äôs fortunes increasingly drive everyone else‚Äôs. At $3.6tn, the company is the world‚Äôs biggest by market capitalisation, and makes up 7Ô∏è‚É£% of the S&P 500 index. Back in 2000 when Cisco briefly became the planet‚Äôs most valuable company, its weighting was less than 4Ô∏è‚É£% of the S&P. As of Wednesday, Nvidia‚Äôs stock accounts for 2Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£% of the index‚Äôs gains this year. The result is that when Nvidia does well, animal spirits ü¶ç rise across the market. Bank of America analysts had calculated this week that investors were expecting a 1% index move in response to Nvidia‚Äôs earnings ‚Äî greater than the shift they expect from US inflation data later this month. In the short term, Nvidia has the enviable benefits of both scale and scarcity. Supply constraints keep prices high, and the company says demand for its new Blackwell chips will exceed its expectations of 'several billion dollars' in the current quarter. üí∏ Meanwhile, governments from Saudi Arabia to Denmark are seeking to build their own state-backed artificial intelligence initiatives, so while Silicon Valley depends on Nvidia, the reverse is becoming less true.
