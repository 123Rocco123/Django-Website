,,"Apparently there is an AI boom. You can tell because Jensen has a tie on under his jacket. Usually he can only afford the jacket, but in a boom he can afford a nice tie too. Which is good, Jensen should treat himself he doesn’t work at Dennys anymore.",0,0.52,NEGATIVE,0.947
,,"Yes, this is especially clear from the fact Jensen can now afford a tie.Going forward, to keep track of the progress of the AI boom, we should keep a keen eye for any further wardrobe changes to Jensen.We should also remember that we cannot see what he wears at home in private - it could be that he needed to stretch for the tie, resulting in burlap sacks as housewear. This would suggest the AI boom is mostly smoke and mirrors.It could also be true that he has a ball-pit-esque containment of ties in which he bathes regularly, pretending to be a car going through a washing station. This would be incredibly bullish for the AI boom story.",1,0.529,NEGATIVE,0.966
