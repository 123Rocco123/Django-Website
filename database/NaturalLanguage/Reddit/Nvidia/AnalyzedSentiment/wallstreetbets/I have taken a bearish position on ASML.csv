,"ASML had a brief relief rally on 14th November, 2024 (on the day of Investors meet) and the stocm moved upto 670 € (above its 50 days moving average). Despite very positive outlook by the company's management on the semi conductor industrt and future prospects of ASML, the rally was very short lived and the very next day (15th November, 2024) the stock plummeted to 630 € confirming the bearish trend. The stock since then has hovered between 618-636 € range. The stock is repeatedly testing psychological support at 618 €. The next support level is at 565 €. I have bought PUTs at 600€ strike and 20th December expiry. A small write up on the company: ASML is the Dutch manufacturer of advanced semiconductor equipments and lithographic machines. They have the EUV [Extreme Ultra Voilet] technology to produce machines to craft 5 nm and smaller size chips. These are the latest AI chips used for very high performance tasks like training LLM models etc. Nvidia and other foundaries (TSMC, Samsung, SK Hynix) depend on ASML machines. But their workhorse is DUV [Deep Ultra Voilet] technology which is used for manufacturing non AI chips and far exceed requirements in form of less intensive but more utilitarian forms like house hold appliances, cars, home laptops, computers etc. Chinese have developed/acquired DUV technology and are able to produce upto 7 nm chips at a fraction of the cast. DUV machine may be used to produce 5 nm chips but it will lack density and in computing power. Some unconfirmed reports have stated that Chinese have made significant progress in EUV technology but we are yet to see an actual proof of that.

Or TSMC who's building new plants.ASML has been frustrating, but I don't think it's going to dip like this reliably without a market wide movement.
