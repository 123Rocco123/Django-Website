,"Happy thanksgiving to all of you, I hope you are able to spend time with your loved ones. Just some discussion points about overall valuations in the equity markets. This is something that I have wondered for a while. Almost every asset under the sun has skyrocketed, and obviously people are planning to get a return on their investment, so let's discuss how this is even supposed to happen at this point. First, there's the low hanging fruit in terms of arguments supporting that we are in a wildly overvalued equity bubble. Dogecoin is worth more than Nintendo. Palantir trades at nearly 60x revenue and made a nanopenny of earnings on a market cap that is nearing ASML's. Tesla is worth $1.1T and thus somehow larger than berkshire. Carvana. I'm not even going to talk about bitcoin. These are prime examples of rampant market speculation and I believe nobody who has their two brain halves connected would argue that these are not cult assets that are disconnected from reality. But digging a bit deeper, the bubble doesn't remotely seem to be isolated to certain sectors. Apple is a lick away from 40x earnings. Walmart trades at nearly 40x earnings. Costco somehow manages to sell at nearly 60x earnings. Eli Lilly commands an 85x multiple as an entry price. ServiceNow trades at nearly 175x GAAP eps. These aren't 2021-style ARKK stocks but the largest companies in the world. Nvidia is probably the greatest financial success story of all time but they too quickly need to find another $80 billion of annual earnings somewhere otherwise they will also eventually implode like a neutron star. And all of that is happening while the 10-year yields close to 4.5%! I mean, I like walmart and I like costco. They are good companies. It's a sticky business and they have carved out a nice piece of the U.S. economy for themselves. But Walmart does nearly $700b in revenue and has 3% operating margins. The current EPS yield is barely 2.5%. What is supposed to happen here? Earnings isnt expected to skyrocket and that multiple is so stretched that even 10% yearly EPS growth may leave bulls without a return until 2034. Never, even in my fever dreams, would I have believed that a company like costco would command a 60x premium. It seems to me that nearly any asset imaginable is wildly overbought and that people are just pouring they paychecks into the stock market because it has a history of only going up and to the right. But multiples are arguably way ahead of themselves. Current CAPE-ratio has only been higher during two times in history: 1929 and the dotcom bubble. This is kind of a cliché but at the same time, owning these stocks nets you nearly nothing. So what's the game here? Are people betting that Costco will trade at 80x earnings next year? Everything I know as a value investor tells me that this must end and that it is time to hedge. But at the same time, anyone who has shorted this ridiculous market has been ground to a pulp by the onslaught of endless liquidity that's pouring into the market. So what do you guys think? Are the U.S. stock markets about to pull a Nikkei and leave us all grinding our teeth until 2040 before a new high will be set?

,"Happy thanksgiving to all of you, I hope you are able to spend time with your loved ones. Just some discussion points about overall valuations in the equity markets. This is something that I have wondered for a while. Almost every asset under the sun has skyrocketed, and obviously people are planning to get a return on their investment, so let's discuss how this is even supposed to happen at this point. First, there's the low hanging fruit in terms of arguments supporting that we are in a wildly overvalued equity bubble. Dogecoin is worth more than Nintendo. Palantir trades at nearly 60x revenue and made a nanopenny of earnings on a market cap that is nearing ASML's. Tesla is worth $1.1T and thus somehow larger than berkshire. Carvana. I'm not even going to talk about bitcoin. These are prime examples of rampant market speculation and I believe nobody who has their two brain halves connected would argue that these are not cult assets that are disconnected from reality. But digging a bit deeper, the bubble doesn't remotely seem to be isolated to certain sectors. Apple is a lick away from 40x earnings. Walmart trades at nearly 40x earnings. Costco somehow manages to sell at nearly 60x earnings. Eli Lilly commands an 85x multiple as an entry price. ServiceNow trades at nearly 175x GAAP eps. These aren't 2021-style ARKK stocks but the largest companies in the world. Nvidia is probably the greatest financial success story of all time but they too quickly need to find another $80 billion of annual earnings somewhere otherwise they will also eventually implode like a neutron star. And all of that is happening while the 10-year yields close to 4.5%! I mean, I like walmart and I like costco. They are good companies. It's a sticky business and they have carved out a nice piece of the U.S. economy for themselves. But Walmart does nearly $700b in revenue and has 3% operating margins. The current EPS yield is barely 2.5%. What is supposed to happen here? Earnings isnt expected to skyrocket and that multiple is so stretched that even 10% yearly EPS growth may leave bulls without a return until 2034. Never, even in my fever dreams, would I have believed that a company like costco would command a 60x premium. It seems to me that nearly any asset imaginable is wildly overbought and that people are just pouring they paychecks into the stock market because it has a history of only going up and to the right. But multiples are arguably way ahead of themselves. Current CAPE-ratio has only been higher during two times in history: 1929 and the dotcom bubble.

Boomers can contribute on their own with 401ks rather than facing a blanket increase in payroll taxes. The feds top the fund up with QE if the line ever starts going down.It's a wealth transfer.

Multiples expanded and that became the new norm.Regular people all over the country upgraded to way bigger houses because they could get cheap mortgages. They did cash out refinancing. All that cash goes back into the economy. Stocks are easier than ever to buy and it’s pretty popular: a lot of than money went to the market and increasing prices.Interest rate went up just recently, but the multiples won’t correct because everyone is still moving money around the market chasing the gains that have become normal. People still believe that owning a share is like owning a piece of a company, but the reality is that they are completely different assets, and stock price fluctuates with stock demand, not with underlying company value. As long as more people are putting more money into the market, demand will outstrip supply and the multiples will go up.One day, something will happen and it will correct, but no one will see it coming and no one will know when.",0,0.557,NEGATIVE,0.993

Palantir trades at nearly 60x revenue and made a nanopenny of earnings on a market cap that is nearing ASML's. Tesla is worth $1.1T and thus somehow larger than berkshire. Carvana. I'm not even going to talk about bitcoin. These are prime examples of rampant market speculation and I believe nobody who has their two brain halves connected would argue that these are not cult assets that are disconnected from reality. But digging a bit deeper, the bubble doesn't remotely seem to be isolated to certain sectors. Apple is a lick away from 40x earnings. Walmart trades at nearly 40x earnings. Costco somehow manages to sell at nearly 60x earnings. Eli Lilly commands an 85x multiple as an entry price. ServiceNow trades at nearly 175x GAAP eps. These aren't 2021-style ARKK stocks but the largest companies in the world. Nvidia is probably the greatest financial success story of all time but they too quickly need to find another $80 billion of annual earnings somewhere otherwise they will also eventually implode like a neutron star. And all of that is happening while the 10-year yields close to 4.5%! I mean, I like walmart and I like costco. They are good companies. It's a sticky business and they have carved out a nice piece of the U.S. economy for themselves. But Walmart does nearly $700b in revenue and has 3% operating margins. The current EPS yield is barely 2.5%. What is supposed to happen here? Earnings isnt expected to skyrocket and that multiple is so stretched that even 10% yearly EPS growth may leave bulls without a return until 2034. Never, even in my fever dreams, would I have believed that a company like costco would command a 60x premium. It seems to me that nearly any asset imaginable is wildly overbought and that people are just pouring they paychecks into the stock market because it has a history of only going up and to the right. But multiples are arguably way ahead of themselves. Current CAPE-ratio has only been higher during two times in history: 1929 and the dotcom bubble. This is kind of a cliché but at the same time, owning these stocks nets you nearly nothing. So what's the game here? Are people betting that Costco will trade at 80x earnings next year? Everything I know as a value investor tells me that this must end and that it is time to hedge. But at the same time, anyone who has shorted this ridiculous market has been ground to a pulp by the onslaught of endless liquidity that's pouring into the market. So what do you guys think? Are the U.S. stock markets about to pull a Nikkei and leave us all grinding our teeth until 2040 before a new high will be set?

We are just a few rate cuts away before the market will consider small caps again imo. Neutral to bullish scenariowe keep piling into the large caps you mention and keep inflating assets until it imploded because of some external reason nobody saw coming. This also destroys any opportunity for small caps to rise again. Bearish scenariowe just hold the stocks we currently hold and it will just trade sideways for the next year and consolidates as Goldman expects. Meaning no more large gains but still big drops as the most overvalued (palantir, Carvana) finally drop. Neutral scenario.the a.i. Revolution really continues and we will see even more return on capex and higher capex spending than we saw this year.

,"Happy thanksgiving to all of you, I hope you are able to spend time with your loved ones. Just some discussion points about overall valuations in the equity markets. This is something that I have wondered for a while. Almost every asset under the sun has skyrocketed, and obviously people are planning to get a return on their investment, so let's discuss how this is even supposed to happen at this point. First, there's the low hanging fruit in terms of arguments supporting that we are in a wildly overvalued equity bubble. Dogecoin is worth more than Nintendo. Palantir trades at nearly 60x revenue and made a nanopenny of earnings on a market cap that is nearing ASML's. Tesla is worth $1.1T and thus somehow larger than berkshire. Carvana. I'm not even going to talk about bitcoin. These are prime examples of rampant market speculation and I believe nobody who has their two brain halves connected would argue that these are not cult assets that are disconnected from reality. But digging a bit deeper, the bubble doesn't remotely seem to be isolated to certain sectors. Apple is a lick away from 40x earnings. Walmart trades at nearly 40x earnings. Costco somehow manages to sell at nearly 60x earnings. Eli Lilly commands an 85x multiple as an entry price. ServiceNow trades at nearly 175x GAAP eps. These aren't 2021-style ARKK stocks but the largest companies in the world. Nvidia is probably the greatest financial success story of all time but they too quickly need to find another $80 billion of annual earnings somewhere otherwise they will also eventually implode like a neutron star. And all of that is happening while the 10-year yields close to 4.5%! I mean, I like walmart and I like costco. They are good companies. It's a sticky business and they have carved out a nice piece of the U.S. economy for themselves. But Walmart does nearly $700b in revenue and has 3% operating margins.

During that time there was a cascade effect where money(institutional) left bonds and moved into blue chip stocks and money left blue chip stocks and moved into tech and money left tech and moved into more risky investments. It's like, the safest investments started paying almost nothing and so that money moved into stocks that were becoming less risky and paying bigger returns. This blew up the conventional wisdom on P/E.Now that we are in an environment where treasuries are greater than 4%, I think the fact that Costco is still trading at almost 60x earnings is a good indication that investors think that we are eventually moving back to the near zero interest rate, QE environment.

,"Happy thanksgiving to all of you, I hope you are able to spend time with your loved ones. Just some discussion points about overall valuations in the equity markets. This is something that I have wondered for a while. Almost every asset under the sun has skyrocketed, and obviously people are planning to get a return on their investment, so let's discuss how this is even supposed to happen at this point. First, there's the low hanging fruit in terms of arguments supporting that we are in a wildly overvalued equity bubble. Dogecoin is worth more than Nintendo. Palantir trades at nearly 60x revenue and made a nanopenny of earnings on a market cap that is nearing ASML's. Tesla is worth $1.1T and thus somehow larger than berkshire. Carvana. I'm not even going to talk about bitcoin. These are prime examples of rampant market speculation and I believe nobody who has their two brain halves connected would argue that these are not cult assets that are disconnected from reality. But digging a bit deeper, the bubble doesn't remotely seem to be isolated to certain sectors. Apple is a lick away from 40x earnings. Walmart trades at nearly 40x earnings. Costco somehow manages to sell at nearly 60x earnings. Eli Lilly commands an 85x multiple as an entry price. ServiceNow trades at nearly 175x GAAP eps. These aren't 2021-style ARKK stocks but the largest companies in the world. Nvidia is probably the greatest financial success story of all time but they too quickly need to find another $80 billion of annual earnings somewhere otherwise they will also eventually implode like a neutron star. And all of that is happening while the 10-year yields close to 4.5%! I mean, I like walmart and I like costco. They are good companies. It's a sticky business and they have carved out a nice piece of the U.S. economy for themselves. But Walmart does nearly $700b in revenue and has 3% operating margins. The current EPS yield is barely 2.5%. What is supposed to happen here? Earnings isnt expected to skyrocket and that multiple is so stretched that even 10% yearly EPS growth may leave bulls without a return until 2034. Never, even in my fever dreams, would I have believed that a company like costco would command a 60x premium. It seems to me that nearly any asset imaginable is wildly overbought and that people are just pouring they paychecks into the stock market because it has a history of only going up and to the right. But multiples are arguably way ahead of themselves. Current CAPE-ratio has only been higher during two times in history: 1929 and the dotcom bubble. This is kind of a cliché but at the same time, owning these stocks nets you nearly nothing. So what's the game here? Are people betting that Costco will trade at 80x earnings next year? Everything I know as a value investor tells me that this must end and that it is time to hedge. But at the same time, anyone who has shorted this ridiculous market has been ground to a pulp by the onslaught of endless liquidity that's pouring into the market. So what do you guys think? Are the U.S. stock markets about to pull a Nikkei and leave us all grinding our teeth until 2040 before a new high will be set?

Right now inflation has been ridiculously high leading to massive bear market in bonds /cash.. There is roughly 100 trillion in stock markets but also there is 100 trillion in the bond markets.. If you think governments will not be able to get their budgets under control and continue with deficit then stocks could still be supported in nominal terms as inflation hedge as money flows form bonds to stocks even if they are declining in real terms as currency collapse crisis become more common place forcing governments to balance their budget. The high multiples you see in huge companies with growth behind them is because they are recession proof selling things that people need no matter what making them immune from any downturn making them better hedge against stagflation (Slowdown + inflation). Things that are much more cyclical or would be the first things people would cut from spending trade at much lower multiples with the exception of extreme growth like in tech/AI for example. You are right though the amount of short/medium term gains in some of these stocks has been excessive and should not be expected to continue but that doesn't necessarily mean a huge crash will follow therie could be a lengthy period of consolidation sideways trading.. those who buy them don't buy them for excess returns they are looking for measly single dig annual returns that is still seen as a win. In general the market is efficient most of the time so every option appears indifferent, this why you need to focus smaller more niche markets with higher potential growth where the potential for inefficiency and mis pricing is much greater.",0,0.536,NEGATIVE,0.997

Everything I know as a value investor tells me that this must end and that it is time to hedge. But at the same time, anyone who has shorted this ridiculous market has been ground to a pulp by the onslaught of endless liquidity that's pouring into the market. So what do you guys think? Are the U.S. stock markets about to pull a Nikkei and leave us all grinding our teeth until 2040 before a new high will be set? Hope that turkey tastes well by the way.","The US has boomers sitting on 70T of wealth. At least a 1/4 of it is not in stocks but land, housing and others. How many Gen Zs will take grandpa's homestead and decide to become a farmer? They will sell that land that money needs to go somewhere. Now multiply that amount with the boomers wealth of other industrialized nations. We heard the term ""all time high"" too often.

,"Happy thanksgiving to all of you, I hope you are able to spend time with your loved ones. Just some discussion points about overall valuations in the equity markets. This is something that I have wondered for a while. Almost every asset under the sun has skyrocketed, and obviously people are planning to get a return on their investment, so let's discuss how this is even supposed to happen at this point. First, there's the low hanging fruit in terms of arguments supporting that we are in a wildly overvalued equity bubble. Dogecoin is worth more than Nintendo. Palantir trades at nearly 60x revenue and made a nanopenny of earnings on a market cap that is nearing ASML's. Tesla is worth $1.1T and thus somehow larger than berkshire. Carvana. I'm not even going to talk about bitcoin. These are prime examples of rampant market speculation and I believe nobody who has their two brain halves connected would argue that these are not cult assets that are disconnected from reality. But digging a bit deeper, the bubble doesn't remotely seem to be isolated to certain sectors. Apple is a lick away from 40x earnings. Walmart trades at nearly 40x earnings. Costco somehow manages to sell at nearly 60x earnings. Eli Lilly commands an 85x multiple as an entry price. ServiceNow trades at nearly 175x GAAP eps. These aren't 2021-style ARKK stocks but the largest companies in the world. Nvidia is probably the greatest financial success story of all time but they too quickly need to find another $80 billion of annual earnings somewhere otherwise they will also eventually implode like a neutron star. And all of that is happening while the 10-year yields close to 4.5%! I mean, I like walmart and I like costco. They are good companies. It's a sticky business and they have carved out a nice piece of the U.S. economy for themselves. But Walmart does nearly $700b in revenue and has 3% operating margins. The current EPS yield is barely 2.5%. What is supposed to happen here? Earnings isnt expected to skyrocket and that multiple is so stretched that even 10% yearly EPS growth may leave bulls without a return until 2034. Never, even in my fever dreams, would I have believed that a company like costco would command a 60x premium. It seems to me that nearly any asset imaginable is wildly overbought and that people are just pouring they paychecks into the stock market because it has a history of only going up and to the right.
