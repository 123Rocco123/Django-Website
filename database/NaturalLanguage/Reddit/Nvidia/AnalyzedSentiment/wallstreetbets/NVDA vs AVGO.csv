,"NVDIA vs Broadcom I have a pretty big position in NVDA but am obviously not too thrilled with the stock performance since June. While I am still bullish on NVIDIA and AI, there are a few things that make me pause Apple doing its whole Apple Intelligence thing not planning to spend a single dollar with NVIDIA but rather building custom chips with Broadcom Anthropic going all-in with Amazon's Trainium chips. In the past, big funding for AI startups meant a big check for Jensen. This didn't happen here and could set a precedent Broadcom announcing that it will build 1 million XPU (ASIC) data centers with hyperscalers. So while NVIDIA is clearly ahead of AMD, I don't like the shift to Broadcom ASIC chips. And to be honest it makes a lot of sense to me that Meta or Amazon would build their own chips to do stuff like recommendation engines. So my question is: would you diversify/sell some NVDA stock to buy AVGO in order to be able to benefit both from the GPU and ASIC trends?",GPT-REEEE,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

,"NVDIA vs Broadcom I have a pretty big position in NVDA but am obviously not too thrilled with the stock performance since June. While I am still bullish on NVIDIA and AI, there are a few things that make me pause Apple doing its whole Apple Intelligence thing not planning to spend a single dollar with NVIDIA but rather building custom chips with Broadcom Anthropic going all-in with Amazon's Trainium chips. In the past, big funding for AI startups meant a big check for Jensen. This didn't happen here and could set a precedent Broadcom announcing that it will build 1 million XPU (ASIC) data centers with hyperscalers. So while NVIDIA is clearly ahead of AMD, I don't like the shift to Broadcom ASIC chips. And to be honest it makes a lot of sense to me that Meta or Amazon would build their own chips to do stuff like recommendation engines. So my question is: would you diversify/sell some NVDA stock to buy AVGO in order to be able to benefit both from the GPU and ASIC trends?",It‚Äôs not a case of ‚Äòvs‚Äô.,0,0.498,NEGATIVE,0.719
