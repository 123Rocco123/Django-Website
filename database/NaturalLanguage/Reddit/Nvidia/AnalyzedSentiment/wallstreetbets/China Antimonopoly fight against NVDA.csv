Chinese GPU makers are literal decades behind NVIDIA's tech. Their best card can barely compete with a 3060, while NVIDIA's crushing it with the 4090 and prepping next-gen stuff.

China isn't ""kicking NVIDIA out"" - they're launching a probe because they're desperate to catch up. The market impact? Even with the probe news, NVIDIA still dominates with over $60B in revenue and they're expanding globally.You're missing the bigger picture - while China's trying to play catch-up, NVIDIA's already backing next-gen AI infrastructure projects in Canada. They're not just selling GPUs, they're building the future of AI compute.China can't just ""create a market"" out of thin air. Their domestic chips are generations behind - you need cutting-edge tech for AI and data centers. That's why NVIDIA keeps winning despite all the restrictions. The gap isn't just about performance, it's about the entire AI ecosystem NVIDIA's built. No amount of market protection changes that fundamental reality ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",4,0.546,NEGATIVE,0.995

Gaming GPUs are like their side hustle now - their data center revenue is crushing it with $18.4B in a single quarter. Consumer graphics cards? That's just the tip of the iceberg.The real gold mine is enterprise AI. Every major tech company is dumping billions into AI infrastructure, and guess who's supplying the hardware? NVIDIA. They're not just selling to your gamer friends anymore - they're powering entire AI data centers worth billions.Your ""ask your friends about their PCs"" take is like saying McDonald's should only care about drive-thru customers while ignoring their massive real estate empire.

Enterprise is where you make the real money, retail is just a bonus. Do you think HP makes more money from selling shitty black and white laser printers to random old people who still want a private printer or from selling servers, switches, and MFPs to companies who buy them by the ton? Microsoft also makes the vast majority of its money from selling MS Office And Azure to businesses.A business can drop 200k on hardware that improves productivity by like 5% and not even blink because they know they'll make it back quickly. Retail isn't going to spend that much for such small gains, most people are going to buy some midrange hardware and keep it running for 5 years before the next upgrade.",4,0.527,NEGATIVE,1.0
