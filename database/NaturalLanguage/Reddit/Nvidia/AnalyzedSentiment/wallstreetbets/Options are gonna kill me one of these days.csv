,My wife thinks I've bought a few etfs.,Iâ€™ve been reading this sub for years. Have swung $100k in a day a few times.

,My wife thinks I've bought a few etfs.,"Options are basically futures but weird. Returns can be stupid but so can the losses.I just trade $SPY 0DTEs like a degenerate but my hit rate is pretty decent. (+85% today) Itâ€™s all about risk management, cut the losers early and let the winners run. The people that lose everything usually made a bad play and let it run to zero or doubled down. Donâ€™t do that, options rarely go in your favor after tanking.If you can trade them like a robot they make bank.",1,0.509,NEGATIVE,0.826,0.509,0.826

,My wife thinks I've bought a few etfs.,"Iâ€™ll cut early manually when the trade idea has been invalidated, but most of the time Iâ€™ll also have an automatic SL set for ~40% to give it some breathing room. If it goes down more than that while still being a valid trade, my entry was trash.When a breakout pulls back and is retesting a previous resistance level, Iâ€™ll enter when the price holds above the new support. If it breaks back below then Iâ€™m immediately out, because my plan failed.",3,0.526,NEGATIVE,1.0,0.526,1.0
,My wife thinks I've bought a few etfs.,"Thanks for your response. How do you determine 'holds above the new support', how much time should pass? I mean I get all this theory, but quite often it seems like price goes below supports / above resistances just on purpose, to f##k everyone and then it just stays in range or goes opposite way.My losses are huge since I hate to lose even -1% on a trade and then ending up loosing -80% or -90%. Winners are pathetically small since once it's breakeven I typically close at smallish gains, less than 10% in profit. Overall I'd say my 'winning' trades % is over 4 in 5 trades but due to losses and winners % I'm deeply in the red.",4,0.523,NEGATIVE,0.998,0.523,0.998
,My wife thinks I've bought a few etfs.,"I'm gonna point you to this guy's comment over on r/daytrading because his strat is very similar mine, although he doesn't use options: https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1ggpvw5/comment/lurk8nd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_buttonIt's a strategy based on the five-minute opening range. You mark out the high and low of the first 5m candle of the day, and then you just wait. You want a 5m candle to *close* outside of the opening range, then you want to wait for the price to come back to the high or low line, and hit resistance. If a candle wicks into or near the range but doesn't cross, it looks good, and I enter. Usually it'll start picking up momentum pretty quick afterwards.If the price drops back into the range more than halfway or even crosses to the opposite side, get tf out.This strat also has the benefit of being easy to identify consolidation days because you'll clearly see the price just staying in one range. If I don't see anything good by 11, I usually just sit out. Don't need any fancy indicators, just price action.Paper trade to get the hang of the timing, and check out some screenshots in that comment thread for examples. Futures are easier but options can print like this. Some people prefer the 15m opening range, 30min etc. No matter what you pick it'll teach you to get good at reading the chart and candles.",5,0.519,NEGATIVE,0.957,0.519,0.957

,My wife thinks I've bought a few etfs.,"Leaps cost more because you are paying for time. If the option expires OTM, it is worthless, so an NVDA 200 call expiring tomorrow won't be in the money. A 200c NVDA expiring 2 years from now still has a good chance of being in the money as long as they continue to trend upward over time.As long as the stock trends in your favor (call or put), leaps will gain value for you, even if they don't end up ITM becsuse they have so much time for expiry.",3,0.541,NEGATIVE,0.913,0.541,0.913

,My wife thinks I've bought a few etfs.,"Watch some youtube videos, learn what the greeks are and how options are priced, try to stay in pretty liquid contracts and do longer expiries at first. Avoid weeklies unless you really need action and don't care if you lose it all. Don't let your ITM contracts expire. Accept that you will lose money while you're learning. You can also make a ton of money in a hurry if you're willing to risk it. Above all, understand that no matter how good/lucky you are, long options are just glorified gambling.
