Last year for each category they sold and had this sale, it was shoulder to shoulder in the store.This time, there was like 3 people, and the cashier said it had been dead all afternoon/evening.Many of you may recall the guy who was tracking people in BBWI stores around New Jersey or whatever it was last year - I played along as well because of how packed the stores were from my experience.I'm holding 50 $28 11/29 puts and 25 $33 11/29 puts.
