,"It's up 14% this morning. They signed a NATO contract recently. NATO and satellite imagery firm Planet Labs have signed a contract for a “virtual” constellation of surveillance, intelligence, and reconnaissance space assets—the latest sign of NATO’s growing reliance on commercial space capabilities.  The contract is the first under the Alliance Persistent Surveillance from Space (APSS) program, launched by NATO early in 2023, in which 17 member states including the U.S. agreed to pool and distribute intelligence and surveillance data culled from both from national and commercial satellites. Described by NATO officials as as the largest space project in its history, APSS will be worth a combined $1 billion over the next five years.

NATO and satellite imagery firm Planet Labs have signed a contract for a “virtual” constellation of surveillance, intelligence, and reconnaissance space assets—the latest sign of NATO’s growing reliance on commercial space capabilities.  The contract is the first under the Alliance Persistent Surveillance from Space (APSS) program, launched by NATO early in 2023, in which 17 member states including the U.S. agreed to pool and distribute intelligence and surveillance data culled from both from national and commercial satellites. Described by NATO officials as as the largest space project in its history, APSS will be worth a combined $1 billion over the next five years. They also recently signed a seven-figure deal with Laconic. SAN FRANCISCO, December 02, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Planet Labs PBC (NYSE: PL), a leading provider of daily data and insights about Earth, today announced that they have signed a multi-year, seven-figure deal with Laconic, a company leading a global shift in climate finance, empowering governments to monetize natural carbon assets through its Sovereign Carbon securitization platform. For the next three years, Laconic will be receiving both Planet’s 3 meter Forest Carbon Monitoring product and its 30 meter Forest Carbon product.

Planet Labs is also close to shipping Pelican-2, which is the company’s next-gen high resolution satellite. Pelican is the successor to SkySat and is expected to offer 40 cm resolution, with an ultimate target of 30 cm resolution. This represents a significant improvement over Dove satellite 3m resolution and SkySat 50 cm resolution. In addition to higher resolution, it offers improved image quality, spectral bands and imaging capacity.
