,,"Dude either explain how you calculate your impact factor or just stfu.Here is the only feedback I can give you without information: your graph is absolutely useless without relativity.I don’t know what impact factor 1 2 3 or 5 is based on, nor do I know the scale, for all I know 5 could be low 🤷🏻‍♂️. Like what’s the maximum?",4,0.512,NEGATIVE,0.998
,,Okay buddy. I know what „impact“ means the question here is how do you calculate impact relatively? How did you calculate that China market growth has an impact of 4 to Tesla but only 1.5 to NVIDIA?Did you look what stock moved the most and then made the biggest mover a rating of 5 and gave the rest a relative score? What’s the highest possible score? Don’t you get how dumb your graph is without that information?I’m getting the feeling you shouldn’t be making graphs. You don’t seem to understand the basics of them 👀,5,0.529,NEGATIVE,1.0
