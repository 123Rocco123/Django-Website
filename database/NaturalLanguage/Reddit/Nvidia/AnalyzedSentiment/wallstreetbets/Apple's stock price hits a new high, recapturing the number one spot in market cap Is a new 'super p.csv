Their ""weak"" margins are because they're primarily a hardware company that's successfully transitioning to high-margin services. Services revenue hit $71.2B in 2023 and is growing faster than any other segment.PEG ratio doesn't capture their ecosystem value. Each iPhone/Mac/iPad sale locks users into their services ecosystem for years. That's recurring revenue that keeps growing. Look at their record revenue across dozens of countries - this ain't no 2021 growth stock bubble.Compare their balance sheet to other tech giants - $153B in cash, solid debt ratios, and they're still innovating with Vision Pro while others chase AI vapor. MSFT/META/NVDA might have higher margins but they don't have Apple's brand power or ecosystem lock-in.The 2021 comparison is straight up wrong. Those were unprofitable spec plays.
