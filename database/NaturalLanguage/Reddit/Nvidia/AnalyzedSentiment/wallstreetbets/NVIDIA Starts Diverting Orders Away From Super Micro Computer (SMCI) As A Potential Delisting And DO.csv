,,"This makes no sense to me, and all this article does is suppose this is happening and regurgitates the same shit about the HB report, EY resigning, and looming delist date of 11/16.There is no mention of this from NVDA or from wherever these are getting diverted too (supposedly Dell?). I am not even sure how that would work to be honest... as NVDA sells to the server assembler (SMCI, Dell, ETC).So this article is basically saying, without really providing proof, that NVDA is diverting its orders to Dell.... did Dell order more? Did SMCI suddenly cancel their orders? This seems like a puff piece, for clicks, to further inflame a situation where very little details are known",0,0.51,NEGATIVE,1.0,0.51,1.0
