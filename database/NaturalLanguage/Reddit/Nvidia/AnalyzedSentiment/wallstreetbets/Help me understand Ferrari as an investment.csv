,"I am trying to wrap my head around Ferrari stock but I don’t get it. My issue is that it’s an 85 billion euro company with only 5,000 employees and has an nvidia-level earnings multiple. It seems to be growing at a very nice pace but that pace doesn’t seem high enough to justify the multiple. It has a very nice product but 100 billion dollar market cap for a company that sells under 10k cars in a year sounds like way too much. I’ve heard some very respected investors talk highly about it. Is there some expectation for things to get much better? Maybe they’ll sell more cars, buy a business, raise prices, cut costs? I don’t know much about this company and after very little research I can confidently say that I don’t understand it at all. Anybody have any insight as to why this could be a good investment?",GPT-REEEE,0,,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.999

Their goal is to artificially limit supply and keep their very high margins. They have a very strong brand and will always sell no matter what, recession or not, people who can afford a ferrari will buy one.So when you buy Ferrari you buy a brand not a carmaker. They are like a luxury goods company and license their name so there are alternate oncome streamsBut at these valuations it is likely not a good investment in my opinion.",0,,0.548,NEGATIVE,1.0

Ferrari's former CEO and President, Luca Di Montezemolo, once said he would never allow Ferrari to make more than 5,000 cars per year. However, much higher demand and being a public company have made Ferrari steadily increase supply. Last year, they sold over 13,000 cars, which is more than three times what they were making 20 years ago. The way they are trying to maintain exclusivity is through limited edition versions based on their mainstream products.",1,,0.597,POSITIVE,0.562

Yes, it might look good, but you are looking on ,,dead"" numbers as my senior always told me.As an Investors wants to know, if a company can keep or rise the profit in the futureJust googled the news about VW and I found these points:China: Losing market shares in all categories: Classic enginge, plug-in, Electric.-Europe: Only selling 7.9 mil cars in europe, 2019 it was 9.9mil.-High costs for employees: germany as a strong protection group for employees. So VW cant adjust the number of employees like corp. in USA.Their own IT Sub-corporate ,,Cariad"" failed hard..-Margin: Operative Margin is only 5.6% instead within 6.5-7%.No big game changer cars for electric car markets.Ofc, other brands within VW like Skoda, are doing better. Also Porsche is struggeling in China but still a profit brand. And dont forget the politics.And you can see similar problems also in BWM and Mercedes.Conclusion: VW and co. are not dead. They still have the financial power and models/brand to hold their positions and to transform into succesful e-car providers. BUT Chinese brands and Tesla do have the better Supply regarding E-cars. And the politicians (in EU) are banning classic fuel cars and focusing on E-Car. And looking on the distribution of e-cars market shares, german brands are far behind compared to their classic fuel cars.Just my 2 cents.",5,,0.528,NEGATIVE,1.0

In terms of a market downturn Ferrari will still thrive due to rich people always having a demand to buy them whenever they want regardless of market situations.
