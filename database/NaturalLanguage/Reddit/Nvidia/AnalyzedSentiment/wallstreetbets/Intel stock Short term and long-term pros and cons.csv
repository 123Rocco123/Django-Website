,"TLDR: Any short term bull run will be up to good news that is difficult to predict. As Intel will likely underperform until their longterm goals pay off I believe the stock will continue to fall unless there is good news like alot of Gaudi3 sales/preorders. Gaudi 3 is lower performance than Nvidias newest ai chip though. Long term- Everything Intel is doing are long term investments that will only pay off 2-5 yrs from now. Building fab projected to take 2 yrs, 18A architecture 1 yr to begin production but will require another year for mass production,14A 3 yrs. These projects has high risk of being delayed. Short term- On the short term, great news that has yet to happen is Intel showing progress on using their new High NA EUV Lithography machine, improving issues like low output. This machine is more advanced than what TSMC has and is the one lead intel has over TSMC. The best news possible in the short term for Intel would be TSMC being attacked by China. This would easily lead to Intel tripling in value as TSMC's main operations are landlocked in Taiwan.Global Guardian experts put the likelihood of an all-out invasion at around 35%. Smaller scale escalations like interupting Taiwans trade will also greatly improve nana's position. Chinese military are already being accused of intentionally ramming into Philippine ships. Long term potential could be Astronomical if Intel succeeds in their reversal but competitors are also improving. Nvidia's Ai Chips for example are improving at a faster rate than Intel, making them unlikely to catch up in that area. However, their head start on the High NA EUV machine could make it possible to jump the gap against Nvidia.

You do know that such an invasion and all the atrocities of war will have deep impact on more than just Intel, right? You can't just isolate Intel and expect the world to continue as if nothing happened, everything hangs together and that will also be reflected in Intel stock prices. Just look at Ukraine and Israel, places far from the US yet having a severe impact on the US and its trade partners.

Their military is very untested - they don't throw some country against the wall every few years like the US does.  The Russian invasion has shown that the OECD countries are serious about cutting off serious aggressors, even at decent cost to themselves.  China has plenty of big problems, from its demographics to the economy, among others.  It likes to saber rattle and make a lot of noise but it backs down from actual confrontation.  Taiwanese people are pretty united against China at this point - look at how long it has been since the KMT won an election.  An amphibious invasion across a rough strait is not easy for any military.  Invading Taiwan also doesn't really gain China or Xi anything substantial.  And finally, Xi knows that if he invades, it's rolling the dice on his grip on power.  Otherwise, he has multiple decades.  China's not going to invade. ",1,,0.519,NEGATIVE,0.958

Europe had a huge spike in electricity, gas, and oil prices that it's still dealing with today, though between increased US production, a lot more LNG infrastructure, and buying more from places like Azerbaijan (hence their feeling empowered to kick Armenians out of their country).  The West really did incur a significant cost in moving mountains to completely cut off imports from Russia.  And other buyers are finding it more difficult to get those goods - no gas pipelines to China currently, Western insurance companies won't insure Russian oil tankers, etc - and are also receiving huge discounts because Russia has few buyers. It's probably not possible to cut off China as much as Russia was, but there are all sorts of levers that the OECD has available, and the counties most affected - likely Japan and South Korea - are heavily incentivized to bear the cost of cutting off China, just like Poland, Germany, the Baltic countries, and others were to cut off Russia.  The Chinese economy is currently very fragile, and it's political system is very brittle, so it wouldn't take a lot to send the country into crisis. China has been buzzing Taiwan with planes for years, and definitely could bomb them back to the Stone Age, but they've refrained from doing so.  What would it gain from leveling Taipei vs what would the world reaction be to a major world city being obliterated?  China would gain the instant undying hatred of all of Asia, and for no real benefit.  TSMC is building fabs in Arizona, Dresden, and Kumamoto, but the majority of its production, and all of the most advanced nodes, are still in Taiwan.  The Silicon Shield isn't going anywhere.  And chips are very transportable, so worldwide shortages would increase prices in the US, even if enough chips were made in the US for American market needs.  ",3,,0.531,NEGATIVE,1.0

Right now it openly defends Taiwan, including military excercises and so on, but the US made itself too economically depending on Mainland China. So the US will have to make a choice: stand by its principles and show the world it can be relied on in times of need, or chicken out and sell it as 'Murica Furst'. In the former case, the US economy will take a serious blow instantly but probably recovers relatively fast, as soon as alternatives are in place, while in the second case the US economy will take a long term serious blow as lots of strategic partners and allies will back off. Nothing is as bad as an unreliable trade partner who betrays its allies and partners.

Both the USA and Russia have done it a few times in recent decades, China never did. Their ""world domination plan"" is more about using money and soft power to get their way with small countries. And after seeing what happened to Russia, they're probably even less inclined to start an invasion.TSMC is of of my biggest positions. There's a risk they may fuck up and loose their technological edge. Or that China may be able to advance their lithography tech faster than expected which would lead to a revenue decline/deceleration. But I'm certainly not afraid of loosing my money due to a Chinese invasion, it's not going to happen.",0,,0.525,NEGATIVE,1.0

E.g., taking an island here or there and literally claiming almost the entire South China Sea and militarily fortifying it with dozens of strategically placed artificial islands.You underestimate how scary Xi is because unlikely his predecessors, he has shown to be willing to tank China's economy for ideological (e.g., Covid lockdowns a full 18months after everywhere else in the world stopped) or political (e.g., support Russia in their Ukrainian War) purposes. And furthermore, unlike his predecessors, he has almost complete control of the CCP by wiping out nearly everyone that does not support him (even ex-President Hu got very publicly and un-ceremonially removed).And militarily, I doubt there is any active US general that would bet Taiwan winning over a Chinese invasion without significant and lightning-fast US and Japanese naval and air support. The Ukraine War has shown the significant deficiencies with Western Arms (e.g., precision missiles that are extremely expensive and slow to produce with maybe a month of stockpiles).With an authoritarian government, you just need to outlast a democracy/republic based one. Look at the Ukraine War; lots of support initially that is slowly but steadily dwindling. I cannot imagine the US giving Taiwan more than an election's worth (2-4 years) of support before pulling out because the US economy would also be quite wrecked and there would likely be protests as trillions (not the usual billions) of $ of military equipment is expended.",3,,0.518,NEGATIVE,0.999

Historically whenever Putin invaded somewhere, the West would bang the drums loudly, sanction a few people, but do absolutely nothing in terms of aid.Chinese public sentiment is very much pro-invasion (because propaganda makes it seem like Taiwan would easily fall).
