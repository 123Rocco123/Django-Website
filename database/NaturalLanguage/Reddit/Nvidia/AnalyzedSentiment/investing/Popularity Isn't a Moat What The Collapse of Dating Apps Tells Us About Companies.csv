Dating apps, in my opinion, are a fundamentally unstable business model operating with a large group of population that regularly turns over and are not long-term app users, as well as having premium features that cater to some of the least successful users in the dating pool.The vast majority of people in the dating world don’t want to use dating apps long-term. The average customer use case of a dating app is to find someone and then never have to download the app again. Subsequently, you are most likely not going to purchase a subscription service or premium features of the app because mentally, you want to delete the app eventually, and paying for a premium subscription basically locks you in psychologically.There is also the additional factor in the perception that premium features (like Super Likes on Tinder) are used by less successful and desperate people, and people generally don’t want to date desperate people, so paying for things like Super Likes can actually harm you more than help you.For an anecdotal example, I am Gen Z and I have been out of the dating world for at least 6 years, but I met my fiancée on Tinder. Super Likes and premium subscriptions were a thing at the time, but Super Likes were almost always perceived negatively by anyone using Tinder. Anyone that Super Liked me were by far the most desperate and negative users I had ever encountered on the app. After a year or two of using the app, I met my now fiancée and subsequently deleted the app. Gone forever, never bought any premium services, and I hope to never have to use it again.I may not explicitly be the average use case, but what I did is generally the end goal of most users. If the long term goal of your users is to delete the app and never use it again, your business is unstable. The likely real reason we are seeing major drop in revenue is because the economy is bad and people are cutting subscriptions they don’t need to save money, like every other excessive trash-tier subscription service. It’s easier to blame Gen Z though, like how Millenials were always blamed for everything over the last 10 years.",0,0.522,1.0,NEGATIVE

The mainstream dating apps are essentially a free for all. Anybody can sign up. This means a lot of people you see on the apps aren’t people you’re interested in. It also leads to bad behavior (think we’ve all seen screenshots of people being weird on apps, have heard of ghosting, etc.). The mainstream apps tried to solve the matching problem with filtering (Hinge I think did a decent job of this for a bit) but the filters are behind paywalls. They also have introduced behavioral policies that somewhat reduce bad behavior with bans, but the platforms are so large that enforcement is hard and it’s somewhat easy to bypass a ban.Thus, the trend has been towards exclusivity, meaning the filter is at the sign up step. You have to apply to join and get approved as a member before meeting people. Some early apps to try this strategy were Raya (for celebrities/hot people) and The League (originally for Ivy Leaguers but eventually expanded to people beyond it). A few new ones have popped up like Lox Club (which bills itself as “for Jew-ish people with ridiculously high standards”) and its spinoffs Jade Club (for Asian people) and Amara Club (for South Asians). There’s also one called Setup that’s only in NYC right now that is application only and doesn’t even let users message before setting up a date (been using it for about a month and like it so far).I think ultimately what we are seeing is a “stratification” within the dating app scene. The more attractive people (not just physically, but more accomplished, educated, etc.) will gravitate towards a membership based service in hopes that it will lead to a higher quality match. They will leave Tinder/Bumble/Hinge behind. That’s a HUGE problem for these apps because the hot people ARE their product. They are selling less attractive people on the potential of meeting someone out of their league. If those people head elsewhere, well, where is everyone else going to go?",0,0.512,1.0,NEGATIVE

Women prefer to meet guys who are socially vetted somehow.They'll take a 6/10 guy who they meet through a friend over an 8/10 they met online. I don't know how you emulate or remove the creeps. If it was just feedback based, you'd have Women posting negative fb on any guy that pissed them off. Which doesn't necessarily mean they were creepy or should be removed from the app.So it's a tough spot for these apps. Every single person I've met would like to meet someone. And yet so many potential matches out there do not meet. There's some wild game theory going on.Men who have a lot of choice will just sleep around. So initially this is the effect. But then the Women wise up and stop sleeping around easily. They only bang top tier 9/10+ guys which are still plentiful. Since these guys will continue being fuckboys and have lots of choice.Any girl looking for a quick bang can just take a top tier guy at will. There is no reason for her to venture into mid tier guys for a ONS. So the mid tiers, the only thing they have to offer is a relationship. This is what the top tiers do not usually provide since they are in high demand anyway.Keep in mind that top tier Women are also in social circles / being courted by highly successful men. Any girl 9/10 has access to semi/full celebrities, rich businessmen, athletes, you name it. If they are going out and socializing these men will find them. Or even just through social media.So yeah a 6-7/10 guy on a dating app is not exactly a hot commodity. They are not going to find much quality on these apps. What they offer is not in high demand. Their better chance at landing a quality partner is to meet offline.Dating is business, even when it's not apparent. What do you have to offer?

Brands are built over years from their connection to things like quality (Volvo), trustworthiness (Wall Street Journal) or coolness (Hermes). Examples of Economic Moats: Low-Cost Producers: Provide a low cost that is usually based on significant economies of scale. Examples include Walmart, Southwest, FedEx. High Switching Costs: Material expense (money, time, effort) required in order to move to competitor. Examples include Salesforce, Oracle, Microsoft. Network Effect: Value to customer increases with the number of people on the platform. Examples include Ebay, Uber, Reddit. Intangible Assets: Brand names, intellectual property, trade secrets, government approvals. Examples include Pfizer, Nvidia, Coca-Cola. Moreover, often these companies that achieve near overnight success do so because their business doesn’t require significant time, expense or technological sophistication in order to reach such a scale. Looking at the companies I've mentioned, in nearly every case some smart folks with a laptop can replicate their business model; improve on it; and steal their customers. In essence, the things that can be built quickly, are often built on sand.","It’s not zoomers preferring old style dating, zoomers aren’t dating much anymore and old people have known app for years and since apps have become worse than ever they ran away.

The app also added so many more restrictions after this debacle (for them). This was reported and users started fleeing.Snapchat has only ever been for school aged or university aged people and people having affairs. Alot of the functions of Snapchat have been added to Instagram, Whatsapp and Facebook messenger. This is simply other similar companies taking Snapchats marketshare by having a similar product as an add-on to their already existing popular product.GoPro’s technology has floundered because it hasn’t been keeping up with other brands. They were an innovator once upon a time, but it seems many other brands are doing what they did best but other brands are doing it better,’for cheaper and without the technical issues of recent GoPro’s.Allbirds stock was overvalued from the IPO and was a very recent IPO. Again - other companies are making similar products to them due to that companies initial success and the company can’t keep up. They’re making alot of different shoes & products that are cheaper and different to the products that made them famous & popular, that consumers haven’t been responding to. They should be making BETTER and stronger and more attractive WOOL shoes - rather than the same weaker shoes or other cheaper material shoes.Bumble has been going down for awhile - it’s an app where women NEED to initiate a conversation with a man - it’s bound to fall off eventually due to the simple NATURE of women. It was a feminist experiment that obviously was never going to be a hit for long - now they’re turning into a hybrid of Tinder & Match with the questions and other bells & whistles that people don’t care about.The other issue with Match & Bumble is that 45% of female users are just on those apps to “have fun” or “waste time” - which translates to - “we need a hit of validation and we don’t actually want to go on dates with men”. So they’re not using it for the intended purposes.Men are mostly using those apps for Hookups and fewer and fewer women are signing up.All of these apps have been centrally banning women that they suspect are not serious about dating or have been reported so even FEWER female users are on the dating apps or can rejoin.None of this is FADS - it’s simple underperformance or lack of product management or lack of continuing product innovation over competitors (all Capitalism).",0,0.518,1.0,NEGATIVE
