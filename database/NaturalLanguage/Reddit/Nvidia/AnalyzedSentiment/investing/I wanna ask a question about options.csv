Covered calls are not a way to get free money, despite what many say.Selling covered calls is a conservative strategy that is expected to reduce both risks and returns, compared to just holding the underlying asset. The seller will probably see lots of small wins (get the premium and keep the stock) & a few large losses (get the premium and have to sell the stock at a below market price) that will more than offset the wins. Both strategies are likely to make money; buying & holding is likely to make more. Check the returns of any ETF that uses this strategy & compare them to the returns of the assets they own & you'll see this.",0,0.529,NEGATIVE,0.565
