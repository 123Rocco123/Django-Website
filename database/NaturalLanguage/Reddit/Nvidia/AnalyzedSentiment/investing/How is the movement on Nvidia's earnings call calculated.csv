,"I have been trading in and out of Nvidia. I also have a long-term position in my long-term portfolio. On Nvidia's previous quarterly earnings call, some analysts were saying it's expected to jump 10% one way or the other after hours. That was exactly what it did. I've heard this quarter the move is expected to be 7% one way or the other. How is the possible percentage move calculated in these types of situations? I'm assuming it has something to do with options. I appreciate any advice. Thank you in advance.",It's commonly estimated using the value of the closest expiration after the event of 85% of the straddle at the current at-the-money strike.A straddle is a call and put contract at the same strike.So that means - for NVDA.The closest expiration is 11/24. NVDA closed at $504.09.The straddle at 505 strike is approx $37.7585% of $37.75 is $32.0832.08 / 504.09 = 6.35%So the current expected move as of 11/20 after the close is about 6.35%.,0,0.519,0.999,NEGATIVE

There‚Äôs real money behind these numbers. They‚Äôre guesses, but pretty good guesses.",3,0.522,0.999,NEGATIVE

It's the market sentiment that is pricing in the future expectation of the underlying's price movement.It's the probability being assigned by the market on the expected move of the underlying.The concepts are similar to how certain probabilities are generated such as the CME's FedWatch tool which is commonly used as a probability estimate for the Fed target rate.If you want to read more about how some of these types of probabilities are generated - there is a good explanation here on how the CME generates their probabilities - https://www.cmegroup.com/articles/2023/understanding-the-cme-group-fedwatch-tool-methodology.html,3,0.524,0.762,NEGATIVE

An expected move is a way to gauge market sentiment. It literally is what the term ""being priced in"" by the market means. No one in this entire thread has proposed a thesis for a trade.To make a trade - a trader has to have a thesis on whether they believe that the market has not priced the expected underlying movement correctly.If a trader believes that the underlying price will move more than what the market has priced in plus the implied volatility - the trader can go long with a straddle.If the trader believes the opposite - they can write a strangle or stradle or iron condor or related construct.Traders may also simply trade the volatility in a neutral manner to capture the higher premiums.you both use the words probabilities and guesses.Because that's how investing and trading works. An investor or trader is gauging risk and reward based on the probability outcome of a thesis.",5,0.532,0.998,NEGATIVE

It's not practical. Implied move 7%, actual move 0. Maybe next time it will line up or there will be a huge tail and blow everybody up. Or nothing will happen again.",6,0.52,1.0,NEGATIVE
