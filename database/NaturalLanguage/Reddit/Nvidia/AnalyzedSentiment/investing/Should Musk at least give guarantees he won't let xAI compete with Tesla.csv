,"Regarding Musk's $56 billion pay package, should Tesla shareholders BEFORE approving FIRST demand from Musk to give written, legally-binding guarantees on how precisely he wants to develop AI at Tesla and explain how his other company xAI won't compete with Tesla?

The board of directors have a fiduciary duty to shareholders to negotiate the best rate for chief seats.What happened with Tesla is the board is pretty much all in Musk’s back pocket. So Elon said “give me a shit ton of money” and the board just said “okay you’re the boss” and has shareholders vote to approve.But even if it is approved, shareholders cannot approve an illegal compensation package. If the board didn’t negotiate to get the best value for shareholders, etc, then the compensation package is not valid legally.Musk and his sycophants want everyone to keep framing it like you did - that they are backing out of a contract. But that’s not entirely correct. They are misleading you to think the contract was ever valid to start with.It’s a similar tactic with Trump. They aim to change the law, or get away with breaking the law, by convincing everyone they have a right to break the law or that it’s okay that they do it. It’s essentially a propaganda technique.",2,0.54,NEGATIVE,1.0

Stock dilution is another problem.","Being more value than originally expected wasn't the whole picture, that's just how the board is trying to sell it. There were many issues.First, the board is filled with friends and family. The board is supposed to have a fiduciary duty to the shareholders. They can't do that when they're not capable of being objective.Second, the board misrepresented the pay package. Internal projections showed that they were completely on track for achieving the goals set for musk already but they sold it as difficult to achieve.Third, the board never countered with a more reasonable pay package. They never considered finding a different CEO for less money to achieve the same results. They never considered mandating full time effort from musk instead of allowing him to dedicate huge chunks of time towards space x and twitter.Ultimately, those are the reasons that the package was overturned. It's largely because the composition of the board is inappropriate.",2,0.515,NEGATIVE,1.0

,"Regarding Musk's $56 billion pay package, should Tesla shareholders BEFORE approving FIRST demand from Musk to give written, legally-binding guarantees on how precisely he wants to develop AI at Tesla and explain how his other company xAI won't compete with Tesla? I think it's problematic Musk diverted nVidia chips paid with Tesla money to his other company xAI and will allow xAI to use those chips till at least end of 2024. That will benifit xAI but not necessarily Tesla. I honestly think retail investors in Tesla should vote NO on the pay package and first get more legal guarantees from Musk regarding Tesla's AI future. Stock dilution is another problem.",The internal emails released say this was done with full knowledge of both parties. Tesla isn't giving away anything to another company. They are simply taking a different batch when it's ready to ship. What part of that is illegal and why does the general Reddit public think they know about the workings of both companies than the people running procurement for those companies?,1,0.535,NEGATIVE,0.947
