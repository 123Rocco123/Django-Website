,"Hah. I just wanted to have three threads in a row with Nvidia in the title. Though this title is taken directly from MarketWatch. What I found fascinating about this article was how destructive the .com bubble was. That was in 2000-2001. Or 23ish years ago! The fact, I often brag about me being around, for that bubble, which gives me experience with it, and we’re still pulling metrics from that era From MarketWatch: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidia-fueled-tech-rally-puts-nasdaq-composite-record-in-sight-59951214?g=ad5aec42-f1a1-40d9-aa8d-ab928ce5fed8&mod=djem_mwnbulletin An Nvidia-led rally is helping to push the Nasdaq Composite toward rarefied territory, with the tech-heavy index near its first record close in 27 months. The Nasdaq Composite COMP was up 346 points, or 2.2%, at 15,927 Thursday morning, near its record close of 16,057.44 set on Nov. 19, 2021. If the Nasdaq were to finish above that threshold 16,057) Thursday, it would end a drought of 564 trading days without a record close, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That’s the longest such stretch since a run of 3,801 trading days running from March 2000 to April 2015, following the bursting of the dot-com bubble. Wow The other two major U.S. stock indexes — the large-cap benchmark S&P 500 SPX and blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA — have scored a string of records in early 2024. The Nasdaq’s long drought after the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000 left many investors particularly wary of declaring a return of the bull market after the index’s most recent slide. After all, the Nasdaq saw three rallies of 40% or more over the course of the bear market that followed the dot-com bust, with none marking the beginning of a lasting bull, There’s a lot of good points here. One that surprising is the fact that the NASDAQ composite hasn’t broken a record in over 500 days. Everyone is saying that technology is the only one benefiting from this bull market. But the NASDAQ, which is really tech heavy, has been under performing Dow and s&p. Another is like said: the .com bubble burst is still being felt today. And I wonder if a lot of people on this forum slamming Nvidia didn’t go through that bubble and now see anything similar and have Vietnam-like flashbacks and PTSD.",any situation can be similar if you want it to be but comparing any situation in the stock market is comparing apple and oranges…,0,0.569,0.737,NEGATIVE
