,"QQQM (& QQQ) have been performing better than the S&P500 in 2023. Since Technology makes up 50% of QQQM, is it safe to say that QQQM performance is driven mainly by the technology sector? And if you compare it to VGT's performance, which is 100% technology, you will see that the correlation is almost identical while VGT has out performed QQQM. VGT is 50% Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. If you make up a portfolio of Apple+Microsoft+nvidia, you will see a matching correlation again with VGT and QQQM only an even higher performance than VGT. Can we conclude: Apple/MSFT/NVD > VGT > QQQM ? And if one is chasing the QQQM performance, they're better off just buying Apple/MSFT/NVD ?",Just MSFT/NVDA,0,0.505,NEGATIVE,0.976

Nothing lasts forever and that is why it’s good to diversify into many. I would bet faang doesn’t do as well in the future. Just vstax abs relax or Voo and chill.,0,0.515,POSITIVE,0.92
