,"Hi! For the past 2 years I was finally in a financial position where I am able to really think about my financial future. I was a Postdoctoral researcher before moving into industry and let's just say, the pay was less than stellar. I was also working 50 hours a week + while only being paid for 35. Thankfully I left academia for good. Anyway, Over the last 2 years or so I saved around 45,000 Euros - I was able to put 2000-2500Eur a month away directly into my savings, and keep around 200-300Eur a month for investing (has a small +/- depending on whether I took holidays etc ). This is mostly in ETFs (core S&P 500, S&P informatics, Core MSCI World and NASDAQ Cyber security) . I give myself an additional ""bonus"" 100-200 a month to invest in an interesting stock - was an early buyer of NVIDIA and I sometimes reinvest when it dips down a bit. My question is - is this a good strategy ? Or for example can I get away with focusing on one of core ETFs ? My Net income now grew to about 4500Eur over the last years,, my rent is about 550 Euros. From next year I'll switch from a 40 hour contract to a 35 hour one, so it should go down a bit.","If you can make regular contributions, do so to a broad, diversified index ETF that follows the returns of the market.It's boring, but if you do it for 30 years uninterrupted, reinvesting any dividends as good housekeeping, you will retire with at least a million.",0,0.547,NEGATIVE,0.998
