,"Hello all, after months of my own research I've made a portolio. I want to preface this by saying this is not a post looking for advice. I am just wanting to tell you all the investments I've made and the reasons behind them. Also, there is some overlap between my individual picks and my ETF picks. I know. First, the foundation Like any smart investor you need a solid base. Something that will grow steadily and won't make you want to sell out when there is an inevitable market crash. This is why for my first pie, I have gone with 80% VUAG and 20% IGLA. Tech Focus People may say that my portfolio is too heavily weighted towards the USA and tech, I think the tech giants like Apple etc are not going anywhere. So my allocations are as follows, Amazon- Moving into the AI space with Nova, Revenue growing steadily YOY. Microsoft- Almost in the 'too big to fail' category. Not going anywhere and an easy choice IMO. Alphabet- Recovered well and quickly after 2022 crash. Massive AI player. Easy choice Apple- Still most popular in the Phone space. Can only see this stock going one way. Meta- Absolutely flying in recent years. Hopeful Zuck will keep it up. ASML- Riskier pick but believe they will have a good year next year. Looking 4-5 years into the future with this one. Nvidia- Don't think I need to say too much with this choice. Looking long term, very excited about this one. IonQ- Main player in quantum computing space, looking at some volatile years upcoming but I have faith that they could be huge in 5+ years. Consumer Focus Costco wholesale- Almost unshakeable business model, no strong competition IMO. Pets at home- Smaller allocation for this one. Seems undervalued to me as people are always going to treat their pets. Will keep tabs on this one as still unsure. Procter and Gamble- Been around for a million years. Very stable with dividend growth YOY. Walmart- Consumer powerhouse in USA, strong financials and IMO not going anywhere,# Finance Focus Berkshire Hathaway- Trust in Buffett, no pressure from short term market trends. Intuit- Dividend growth YOY, in an incredible place financially. JP Morgan and Chase- In the 'too big to fail' category in my opinion. Involved in so many industries so not dependent on one for revenue. MasterCard- Very able to adapt to the market, only risk is inflation IMO. PayPal- After share price crash in 2022. Revenues didn't faulter and net income bounced back within the year. Undervalued IMO. S&P Global- Adapting well to new tech such as AI. Been around forever. Real Estate Focus Realty income- Unshaken by the market crashes in past 20 years. Dividend Growth YOY. VICI properties- Predictable revenue due to triple net leases. In a strong financial postion. I think I have a good mix of sectors and stability/growth. I am not looking for advice but will take onboard any criticism. Thanks all.",Good for you.,0,0.58,POSITIVE,0.974
