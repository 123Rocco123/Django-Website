,"And Nvidia has both phenomenal growth and profits as well as revenues as opposed to little revenue and massive losses like DJT. But is it safe to short or hold puts given the expected outside investments by nefarious non US dark pools to prop up the stock price to support a potential future POTUS? As an aside here is a statement by Scott McNeely after Sun Microsystems hit $64 a share in 2000. At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?",You're comparing a money laundering pump and dump scheme vs. a legitimate tech company with proven revenues and profits.,0,0.566,NEGATIVE,0.966

At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes.

The price Elon bought doesn’t matter. You’ve given literally 0 reason to justify why trump returning increases value. OR why trump leaving decreased value. Kinda hard to argue the second point cause there’s literally evidence against the fact.,5,0.5,NEGATIVE,1.0
