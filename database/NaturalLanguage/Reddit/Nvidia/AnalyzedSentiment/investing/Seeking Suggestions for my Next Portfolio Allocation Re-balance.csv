,"Hello There! My current portfolio has 34 positions (I like diversification) from where ten holdings have higher allocation. I would like to mention that these allocations were made using an AI tool which analyzed historical data to generate some predictions. However, I would like some human feedback from all of you. Allocations are the following (I include the Earning YTD percentage as well): Company [Ticket] Allocation % in my portfolio Earning YTD % BlackRock [BLK] 24.71% 23.30% Apple [AAPL] 8.66% 12.54% Amazon [AMZN] 5.74% 22.03% Microsoft [MSFT] 4.76% 16.93% Salesforce [CRM] 4.75% 30.03% Nvidia [NVDA] 4.5% 10.46% UnitedHealth [UNH] 3.25% 0.10% Coca-Cola [KO] 3.01% 12.44% AutoZone [AZO] 2.94% 33.28% CocaCola Consolidated [COKE] 2.53% 75.72% From these companies, which one(s) do you consider is overvalued? and which one(s) has its stock overpriced?","AAPL is overvalued IMO. It’s priced like a growth stock but is far from a growth stock and with massive China risk. Not a fan of asset management, but am not so familiar with the BLK valuation. That said, while there are companies and industries in which I’d have a 25% allocation, BLK ain’t one. NVDA may well go higher, possibly a lot, but I can’t help but think it could be CSCO in 1999. UNH, man, I can even get my arms around it. That feels so faith based. How does one do due diligence on a company like that?",0,0.569,NEGATIVE,1.0

I agree with you in terms of AAPL massive China risk and other factors that can potentially affect the stock value, and I'm planning to keep the shares without selling them or buying more. In terms of BLK, this firm has a good business model, but recently there has been too much media attention on their supposedly ""massive accumulation of companies' shares"", so probably I will decrease my allocation on this one. In terms of NVDA, I think there is still time to buy more shares and probably go higher, but a correction to its price will take place respectively due to market conditions. In terms of UNH, healthcare insurance probably can sound like a SCAM but it's a huge market and profitable, more and more people in some states are becoming not eligible for Medicaid plans and are referred to marketplace for insurance; consequently, I'm trying to play a gambling game with this stock., let's see the results later.",1,0.544,NEGATIVE,1.0

You’ve a high allocation to growth and tech and large cap and therefore they’re expensive, but also quality, and I do think most of your companies have wide moats. Only time will tell! In any case, kudos to you: undertaking research; picking solid companies; having investment theses, etc. that’s far more than most people are willing to do.",2,0.534,POSITIVE,0.994
