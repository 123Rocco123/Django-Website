They bought rights to a drug that had been studied years before, but failed clinical trials due to what basically amounted to an incorrect endpoint. I started following the companies progress and FDA interactions, listened to every conference call, and even listened to the FDA advisory committee meeting when they voted in favor of the drug. All went well, and when the deadline for approval came, the FDA declined to approve the drug simply because there was not sufficient evidence that it was comparable to the substance used in the original clinical trials. No saftey of efficacy issues whatsoever though, indicating they felt the drug is safe and does work. The share price crashed even though the FDA clearly stated if the company could supply data from another ongoing study they would re accept the application. I saw this as the biggest buying opportunity ever, and being relatively young (33) if it went wrong I have time to recover. So I bought as much as I could. My average buy price was $9.50 and the company sold a year and a half later paying out $25 a share. So yeah, I did good, but it's far from foolproof and far from anything I'd ever tell someone else to do. To invest like this you have to ""be there"". You have to hear the guys talk on the call every few months, listen to questions from hedge funds, read what the FDA is instructing them to do, try to understand it, and honestly try to figure out if the company is lying about facts. This was a hard 3 year investment and it was very stressful.Currently I own a small position of Aldeyra Therapeutics and I'm not impressed with their CEO at all. Compared to the guy who ran Provention, he's a clown. Will these guys get approval and sell their company? Probably eventually. But I don't think i'm investing in biotech ever again.I am absolutely in microsoft for the long term. Costco, I like, but haven't bought it yet.

Complete luck with the streaming hype got me a realized 60%, sold well below the peak but who cares, it was luck anyways. Pretty sure the index returned similar results over the time period with less risk because obviously Disney tanked in the following years. I got to college and along with thermodynamics and shit, I learned about the 5-factor CAPM and efficient markets.My dad just said ""Buy companies whose products you use, that's how you know they're good"".

One of his points is that those high growth outcomes are why you invest in stocks vs funds (this is classic old school One Up On Wall Street stuff). It’s not a direct shot at a low cost ETF BogleHead approach necessarily but more of a stocks vs actively managed mutual funds comparison with how funds were managed back in the ‘80s.So now you have the “good problem to have” whether to sell off your gainers or do you believe MSFT, for example, is still in a dominant position and worth sticking with? Personally, if the majority of your base is ETF and you have a couple winners that you feel are still on track in today’s economy I’d let them ride.",1,0.517,0.994,NEGATIVE
