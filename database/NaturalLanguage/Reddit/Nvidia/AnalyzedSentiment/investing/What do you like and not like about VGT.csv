A lot of people invest in tech because they want to bet that tech will be an important industry in the coming years. That's a sensible bet since everyone and their mother knows that tech is important.But that's not the bet you're making when you buy VGT or other tech sectors stocks. The bet you're actually making is that tech is going to outperform those sky high expectations that everyone and their mother has for it. You're betting that other investors are undervaluing technology stocks. That's a pretty bold bet!So yes, lots of risk there imho.",0,0.53,NEGATIVE,0.995

If you absolutely cannot ignore the past performance, then you should at least remember that stocks that have been doing well recently are often due for a correct and should maybe be avoided.

Pros: VGT is heavily concentrated (if you want to swing for the fences), and does have many of the usual suspects.  My opinion, based on my understanding of other's opinions, is that sector bets can turn out great but often don't unless you are prescient. The closest I'd personally get is momentum (eg, MTUM) which can be fairly concentrated in a sector when it's been doing great but shifts with the wind. If you have a lot of gains in a sector fund outside of an IRA, it may be very painful to sell due to capital gains. You get locked in even if you think its headed off a cliff.
