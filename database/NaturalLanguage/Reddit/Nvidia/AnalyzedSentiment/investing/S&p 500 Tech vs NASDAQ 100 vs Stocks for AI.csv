,"Greetings! I wanna invest into AI and cant decide whats the best call there. I think most will agree that the best bet for AI is to invest into the Big Companys: Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Meta, Google and Amazon. (Tesla not included because i dont like Elon tbh). Investing into S&P Tech will give me big Apple, Microsoft and NVIDIA but not the other companys. Investing into NASDAQ 100 will give me all of them, but with a lower Rate (can be good can be bad). And of course i just can buy those 6 Stocks. I think Apple (even if they dont have LLMs yet) will be big in AI in 1-2 Years and the capability shipping local AI on all of their devices are insane. Huge potential here + we talk about Apple. Microsoft is playing the AI game better than anyone else right now and coming GPT Versions will slap. I also like the new approach of Meta and with LLAMA there is also huge Potential. NVIDIA is of course also a no brainer (even if some ppl think they are overvalued), they are way ahead of other companys like AMD right now. Amazon while not having insane LLMs right now, has of course on of the best Sectors to apply AI in general. With alphabet i have to say, im not so sure. Their new Model is strong, but i kinda didn't feel good about the company as a whole. Hard to explain why. What would you do and why if AI is the goal ? Just buy the Stocks or ETFs ?",If you don't understand valuations I don't think you should invest in individual stocks,0,0.532,NEGATIVE,0.931

Just buy the Stocks or ETFs ?","If you buy S&P you already have a very high weight of all of the companies you mentioned, without having to guess which one is going to be largerPersonally I think Nvidia's price to earnings ratio of 238.29 is vastly too rich and even for an amazing, growing company with a bright future, anything short of absolute perfection in results could cause a big tumble, like when the crypto hype went away and there was a glut of GPUs. Classic bullwhip effect. Makes me a bit nervous with how big they are in indexes actually.You'll do what you want but I'd say largely go S&P500, you can do a bit of NASDAQ if you really want to overexpose to tech even more, and keep 5% for a fun money betting pool to satisfy yourself",0,0.532,NEGATIVE,0.951
