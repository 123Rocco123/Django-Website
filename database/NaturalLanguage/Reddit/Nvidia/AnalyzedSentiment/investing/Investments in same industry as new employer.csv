,"Hi all - I'm curious about thoughts on diversification away from the industry/sector of your employer. Here is my dilemma: Purchased shares in NVIDIA awhile back. Current market value represents about 5% of my portfolio. I'm bullish on the semiconductor industry over the relative long-haul and my intent was to hold long-term. Recently I've accepted a job in a company that supports the semiconductor industry. Stock price seems to mirror the overall semiconductor industry as a whole. As part of this job offer, I'll receive an initial RSU award with a 3 year vest with estimated total value of 15% of my current net worth with refreshers each year that should allow me to cash out at around 5% of my current net worth. Stock price is fairly volatile but I see more upside than downside risk. About 50% of my investment portfolio (retirement and brokerage) is tied to S&P500 index so I'm further exposed to NVIDIA there. I'm concerned about overexposure to the industry. Would you hold or sell your NVIDIA shares?","Purchased shares in NVIDIA awhile back. Current market value represents about 5% of my portfolio. I'm bullish on the semiconductor industry over the relative long-haul and my intent was to hold long-term.It's important to understand that by selecting an individual stock like this, or sector tilt, you're not making a bet that 'this company/sector will perform well' (as you describe) you're making a bet that 'the market has underpriced the extent to which this company/sector will perform well'. This is quite a different bet.Another way of thinking about this is that a high level of optimism about the future profiability of this part of the tech industry is very much 'priced in' within the current share valuations.This is one reason why it's generally best using simple index trackers rather than tilting towards particular sectors.As to your question, yes I think you are overexposed so I would sell.",0,0.56,NEGATIVE,0.607

Would you hold or sell your NVIDIA shares?","I invest in companies that are well-run in sectors that I understand. Diversification and risk mitigation can be two very different things. I personally don't understand why people would buy stocks across multiple sectors where they don't understand the technology, business model, or have insight into how companies are run but that is usually what passes for diversification.If you believe that the world is on the verge of a total refresh in how they do computing then you should be in the semiconductor industry as well as the industries that support datacenters. You can mitigate risk by spreading your investments around to multiple well-run companies or datacenter builders who are agnostic to which semiconductor company wins, but I wouldn't move money out of an industry if you believe in it.",0,0.549,POSITIVE,0.563
