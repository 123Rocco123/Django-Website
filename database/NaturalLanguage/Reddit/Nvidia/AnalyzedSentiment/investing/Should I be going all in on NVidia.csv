It may run higher, but you are buying closer to the top than to bargain levels. Also, the analysts that give price targets are generally working the sell-side of the market.

It’s easier and easier to sell shares of names with more and more momentum. And there’s no career risk to mark stocks that have come down as dogs.,4,0.53,POSITIVE,0.994

Thanks","People said that Nvidia was overvalued in late 2022 and that it's bull run was over. The thing with tech is, don't ever expect it to be over, tech companies are always innovating (some of them are) and there's always something new. We are just starting to scratch the surface of what AI is capable of, and when everyone realizes its potential, everyone will want AI, and demand for things that can run AI will rise, then so will NVDA. Many don't see it now, but AI will be the next new age in digital computing, just like what Apple and Microsoft did with personal computers in the 1980s-2000s. Maybe you don't see it, but Jensen Huang (CEO of NVIDIA) sees it, and I intend to see it too. Invest before it's too late, Nvidia used to be a small 120 billion dollar company, and now it's the most valuable company in the world (By market cap). The same person who did that is still the CEO, and he can do it again with time. While I would say a market cap of $20 trillion is a bit delusional, $10 trillion is very much within reach.

When 'Main Street ' starts talking about a stock, people say it's too late or has hit the top. This is obviously not always true.No one knows what will happen. If you think the fundamentals are good, invest in it but don't expect 2x - 10x returns in a couple of years. Instead, if you buy an index you get the highs and lows of the market (this won't make you rich or poor). You can yolo it on one stock and can lose your shirt, stay flat, or make a killing.

Also, don't be afraid of antitrust, every single company, given that they're large enough, will be investigated under antitrust. Microsoft has been found guilty of antitrust in the 2000s by selling their internet explorer browser in a bundle with the computers and Operating systems. Their stocks has still been rising for the past decade. With the trajectory it's on and the momentum it's gained, nothing can stop Nvidia now. Good luck investing.",2,0.54,POSITIVE,0.667

Thanks","Sure it's encouraging, but at that time there was a big rush for AI and push for everyone to get stuff out 1st. Now that its all settling down slightly and other companies getting into AI and Quantum, there could potentially be explosive growth elsewhere. Nvidia have secured a lot of the contracts, AMD are also jumping in with a big push for Data Centres next year, so could be AMD who grows 1000% if they can get out faster more efficient next gen chips. Palantir could be the next stock to gain 1000%. Could be IONQ, or D-wave, or Rigetti or IBM or Google all involved in quantum. You should probably do some research into it if youre putting all your money into 1 stock. In the meantime though, stick it in an ETF until you figure it out.

Thanks","Where you're going wrong is just loking at a basic chart, but you don't understand how to look at the actual company and properly evaluate fundamentals. Xerox and a ton of dot com companies blew up in a short timeframe too and most went out of business shortly after. In other words, you can't just look at a basic chart and think that tells the whole story. You need to know why things happen the way they did and if any of it is even substainable.It takes a lot of research and actually understanding of the particular market of a business to even properly evaluate things. If you're the ""hey, this stock rose by ""x"" That automatically means it will do the same forever"" type then you need to cool off a bit and stick to index investing for now. You should be able to tell US and morr importantly yourself why something is a good buy well into the future while keeping in mind past returns don't determine future gains. If you can't draft up actual numbers about the business and tell us and in depth analysis of how it all works and it read a half baked article that mentions buzz words then you aren't making decisions rooted in understanding the business.Thr fact of the matter is most people have no clue how to conduct fundamental analysis and it takes a long time to truly get good at it and even then it takes a metric fuckton of time to continually stay on top of things. It's why you're better off just sticking to an index. Don't fly off at the handle either please. It isn't a diss. It's simply explaining that you didn't do much research at all and don't sem to understand how to evaluate companies and that is why nothing you said truly instills confidence. You can invest, but mentioning 1340% as an indication that it will continue based on nothing else but past numbers does nothing.",1,0.538,NEGATIVE,1.0

That's still a lot though, I believe AI is the future and Nvidia is driving it. Jenseng Huang foresaw the tremendous success AI would have and started developing tech to train and run AI since the late 2000s, it would be at least 10 years before other companies catch up with at least the tech Nvidia has now. I put my faith in Nvidia even when it was $120 (Before the 10 for 1 stock split) and unfortunately got scared and sold at 385. I bought it back in at $1150 (Still before the split) and I'm not too late.
