,"I (m21) make 24/hr, pay about 400/month, and realize I am extremely fortunate to be in this situation. At this time, I have about 100$ a week (I get paid every week) going into robinhood which is invested into large companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, etc and also into funds like a vanguard ETF s&p 500 fund. In total with the market how it is, I have about 1650$ in there. What's the best way to invest long term for an IRA? What are the best apps to be using? Should I ditch Robinhood as ive heard/ understood recently that it's not actually investing my money into the actual stocks but to Robinhood instead? If I set up an IRA should I try to do so with my bank? Or should I be doing it myself? If anyone has any reliable sources of information about this kind of stuff it would bebmuch appreciated as I've heard a ton from both sides whenever i try to look this stuff up","Set up a Roth IRA at a reputable firm (Vanguard and Fidelity are two good options) and put all your contributions into a target date 2060 retirement fund like VTTSX. It holds US and international stocks and bonds, and automatically shifts the allocation over time as you near retirement age. Or you could take on more risk + reward potential and put all that money in a US stock ETF like VOO or VTI.Those are easy places to invest while you gain experience and learn more about the markets. Then you can adjust the portfolio as needed to fit your goals and risk tolerance.",0,0.528,0.622,NEGATIVE
