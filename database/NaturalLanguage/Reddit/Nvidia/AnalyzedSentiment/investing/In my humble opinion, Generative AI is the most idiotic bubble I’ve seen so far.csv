For example govWorks, the company featured in the 2001 documentary Startup.com, didn’t have a bad model. It was cash flow and power struggles that did them in. Some of those companies would probably do well today if they hadn’t bled money so badly back then. Kozmo and Webvan delivered groceries, and Pets.com isn’t that different from what Chewy became. But that’s what happens in a saturated market. Or at least used to; the new version seems to be a SoftBank stepping in and writing one of the competitors a blank check to ensure they win and the others lose.  ",1,0.544,1.0,NEGATIVE

Here are my thoughts.the power needed to constantly retrain and simply generate responses is massive. Its likely that Google and the like are charging a lower price now and intend on skyrocketing that in 5 years. Similar to what the streaming services are going to do.If everyone is using the Generative AI, and everyone is replacing workers with ""prompt engineers"" then either its a pay to win system or everyone is using the same AI, with the same outputs...whats the competitive advantage at that point. In 5 years if you and all your competitors are using Gemini (this is hypothetical, im assuming here that Gemini and its multimodal outputs are ""replacing"" workers) Then in order to simply compete you'll need to rehire humans for their unique perspective.Legal Liability and Plagiarism laws are going to get interesting. I cant see Google letting their model get too unique bc of the risk of hallucination is too large. They're going to want to offset the liability, right now it seems like to do that they are seriously dumbing down the responses to the point of relative uselessness. Maybe thatll end but if it doesnt...oofThe recursion limitation is a massive issue, if these LLMs start training on their own outputs they risk collapse, the simple solution is to better curate data going in and have an archive pre generative AI, but the curated data will come at a hefty price and the risk of leaks is still prevalent. This means the models might just become time limited rather fast, or deteriorate their already elementary (thought grammatically impressive) responses.This means that many big companies are firing employees, and stopping training while adopting a tool that in 5 years will not yield a competitive advantage, will likely cost way more than it does now, and may be losing even more value since its training isn't keeping pace with the times.These are my thoughts at least.",1,0.52,0.999,NEGATIVE

Disclosure: I’m holding an S&P 500 index fund & diversified target-date fund in my retirement accounts; no positions in A.I.-sensitive names.","So much of the hype right now is around LLMs and I agree that a lot of companies clamoring to benefit from this somehow don't really understand its limitations.They just see financial math like if a chat bot talks to this human customer instead of a paid employee it will cost 25 cents instead of $50, so even with mistakes and hallucinations that seems like a good deal. I think the error rate is really too high and the AI can't detect when it is wrong and should triage the customer to the reduced human staff. So then things like this happen:https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/air-canada-must-honor-refund-policy-invented-by-airlines-chatbot/The chat bot's training set seems to include the airline's bereavement policy and the bot even linked to the policy but it's ""understanding"" (read: statements using phrases statistically related to the topic that look human-written) of the policy was wrong and so it gave advice on behalf of the company that a human rep wouldn't have.I look forward to protips where people share prompts you can use on specific support chat bots to make them send you stuff.",0,0.522,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"There was the generalized Internet bubble of the 1990s, in which any company that added a .com to its name would see its shares skyrocket. Then came the Web 2.0 / social media bubble of the 2000s, and cloud in the 2010s. Compared to recent “new technological paradigms,” Generative A.I. seems to have the narrowest use cases, is prone to errors/hallucinations, and is not even a novel concept. Benzinga has been publishing A.I.-generated articles regarding stock price movements, analyst estimates, earnings results, etc. for years before the marketing buzzword “generative A.I.“ became mainstream. You can tell they’re A.I.-generated because they follow a cookie-cutter template and provide few novel insights. I’ve been thoroughly unimpressed with the essays generated by ChatGPT & the like; not only do they contain occasional errors (hallucinations), they’re far from the quality of papers written by competent humans. ChatGPT might be useful for below-average university students to get by, but I don’t see how its use cases are a $10 trillion+ market. For now, seemingly every Fortune 500 company has jumped on the A.I. bandwagon, as simply mentioning A.I. on investor calls automatically leads to increased valuations. Big Tech is extremely skilled at selling hype & FOMO through a new buzz word every few years. I’m just wondering how long this mania might last before it deflates, as previous manias always do. I imagine first, the non-tech companies paying NVIDIA & the like billions of dollars for A.I. chips & data centers would realize the economic/profit gain from Generative A.I. is not as large as forecasted. Then eventually, it hits the tech companies selling the shovels. But this could take years to play out.
