,"I'm a software engineer who is interested in long term investing either in crypto or stock market. It is known that short-term investing is risky and requires time and effort, however my logic says otherwise. I'm a beginner so I apologize in advance for my ignorance, but, could you point out to me the flaws in my thought process and identify the risky parts? Let me provide an example with Nvidia stocks. Facts: 1 Technology is rapidly growing, so Nvidia is likely to increase in value over the long term. 2 Throughout the day, Nvidia's stock price experiences minor fluctuations, including 1% increments. Basic idea: Create a Stock bot programmed to sell stocks once price is incremented at least 1%. The following steps are executed automatically: Bot invests 3000€ in Nvidia stock at the start of the day. Bot waits for the stock price to increase by at least 1%. After 2 hours, the price increases by 1%, and the bot sells the stocks, making a €30 profit. The bot reinvests €3000 and waits for another 1% increase to sell again. Steps 1-3 are repeated indefinitely. Assuming Fact #2 is true, the worst-case scenario is that the bot waits several days for the 1% increase, but it will eventually happen. So, my question is: why not use the above approach to make short-term profits?","""Buy 3000, sell at 3030, immediately buy back in, sell at 3063, immediately buy back in...""My guy that's just long term investing with trading fees.",0,0.566,NEGATIVE,0.99

They don’t do anything.The key to investing is that you’re looking for stocks that will compound so that you don’t lose money to taxation as you can compound the deferred taxation funds and never pay taxes. That’s the free lunch. The principal of using auction generated prices to buy a portion of a business at less than intrinsic value.You can trade, and possibly get better returns if you find some inefficiencies that no one else has found. The real inefficiencies are in special situations that don’t lend themselves to machine analysis. Things you actually have to read and come across.You’re also assuming that stocks only go up, and that the companies that you bet on are going to be more valuable in days.",0,0.524,NEGATIVE,0.999
