The thing about shovels is everyone buying them expects a large ROI on them or demand falls.The demand for more AI compute capacity beyond this initial buildout will be based on how much of an ROI every customer downstream of Nvidia is seeing.It generally doesn't make sense for a ""shovel"" product which is many business layers away from high-margin user spending to be making the most profit across the business stack. For example, ASML and TSMC do not make more profit (or even close) than their customers like NVDA, AMD, and APPL who are completely dependent on them.Right now, Nvidia is making basically all the profit in the new wave of AI projects. For them to continue to sustain growth, eventually every other company involved needs to make even more in aggregate.I have no idea when the fundamentals of AI spend will actually start to matter though - right now everyone is throwing money at AI (particularly generative AI) projects expecting massive productivity gains ""eventually"" and so long as executives think those gains are just a couple years away they'll keep spending.",0,0.557,NEGATIVE,0.988

So all you can do now is Dream that it happens. Hope your mortgage can pay for itself.Any chart you look at, spanning decades, will prove you’ve been completely wrong.
