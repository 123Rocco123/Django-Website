,"My personal portfolio is heavily weighted on Tech. I have been risk averse, so most of it is in Blue Chip Tech companies who are well positioned to take advantage of the upcoming technological revolutions but also have solid revenue making product moats. (MSFT, AAPL). I also have a HUGE unvested position in the AI revolution. So no more money in AI for me. As I look towards diversifying my portfolio, I am struggling to find any industry that also meets the following demands: Solid products that will make money today and 50 years from now Sane P/E ratios (Keep it under 50 at least) Poised to take advantage of one of the upcoming technological revolutions (ie. can expand their market) Hard to beat Moat The other industries that seem to have strong potential are the kind that have been losing money through the likes of Cathy Woods different ARK ETFs. All of Genomics, Drug Development, Space, 3D printing etc. are bleeding money by double digit percentages every year. Manufacturing companies are slowly revolutionizing, but I don't see their market expanding in a fashion that lets their stocks explode.

I still maintain some crypto, but I am not changing my position on that. Either it all sinks or goes somewhere. Not an extra dollar in or out. Also, no Elon Musk companies please. Meme stocks aren't investments, it's gambling. To me, genomics, drones (military) and surveillance are going to explode 10x at least in the next 10 years.
