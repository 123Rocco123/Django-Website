,"Short question, if you invest in the top tech companies, is it easy to beat the marketing meaning the S&P? We’ve all heard the mantra “you’ll never beat the market” but is that really true any more or does the phrase need some sort of updating? I’ve been investing for 15 years now and I think I be beat the market or at least the overall S&P500 every single year. There might have been a year that I nominally missed but if you add up all my investments and look at the gains, it’s significantly higher than if I just invested in a boring S&P ETF. My Fidelity account does this for me automatically and I’ve always been higher…for over a decade now. So hear me out, I’ve made some dumb mistakes and lost $$$ along the way but my winners have always offset that. My game plan is pretty simple: always invest in large cap stocks. With a diverse portfolio made up of Microsoft, Nvidia, Facebook (now meta), Amazon, Tesla, Apple, Nvidia, Amd, and a few others, I’ve found this sector completely destroys the overall “market.” Sure I have a few outliers like Home Depot and OLIN but when I look at my pie chart, it’s very aggressive and very heavily in tech. The difference in the S&P vs the NASDAQ confirms this over the last 20 years or more and you could argue I’ve built my own sort of NASDAQ mutual fund in a ways, but I’m still beating the NASDAQ too. The contrarian’s argument is that given enough time, my large cap tech picks will eventually falter and I will begin losing but at the amount I’m up right now, for over a decade, that correction would have to be astronomical and I don’t see how the whole world economy wouldn’t fall if these tech picks crash down 50% at once. I’m not trying to brag or troll this group or anything like that. I’m just genuinely interested to know if tech has made it relatively easy to now beat the overall market, and if so, what consequences does that have on the stability of the whole market if more investors start doing what I’m doing? Is there a point where the “market” is all tech now? It sure feels like the S&P is so heavily weighted by tech now that maybe that’s the real underlying answer to my question.","You know, someone had this same exact thought in 1999",0,0.516,NEGATIVE,0.995

Just stop, and think for a second. You gambled and won, now pull some chips off the table and play it safe. Look at a company like MU if you were going all in on that run up in 99 it would take 15-20 years just to get back to where you're at today. MU isn't even fucking pets.com or some bullshit. It's a real company, with real $. Still got fucked when the bubble went bust.Or keep it invested, maybe your yearly income isn't great and you're praying for an early retirement.

The internet didn’t even exist until the mid 90s realistically (I know it started in the 70s) but it was all just a pipe dream.The idea that the behemoths like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are somehow going to fail when they basically have all the chips at the table seems crazy to me. I get it, all companies fail, but most of those companies from the past were selling commodities and really only had so much upside. The data mining companies are going to be the foundation for all advertising, biometrics, censorship, data centers, augmented reality, Ai, and possibly future currency.I could be wrong and historically all companies, governments, and all currencies eventually fail but I seems like these handful of companies are now running the world.",5,0.532,NEGATIVE,0.997

The question is for how long and at what risk level? No one comes here to tell the story of how they lost hundreds of thousands or more on a ""sure thing"". You stated yourself that you also made bad picks. You must have felt those were sure things or you wouldn't have invested in them, yeah? So the reality is that luck was a big factor here, both in having some huge winners mixed in with your bad picks, and AI driving the market like a rocket the last few years.And I doubt that you were so prescient that you chose NVDA because it was going to rocket. If you are like many of their individual investors, you likely bought in 2017 because of its graphics offerings (""hey, I like to game, cool, I'll buy some Nvidia!"") and it was reasonably cheap.MSFT has been basically flat for a good chunk of its existence, so was basically no different than a plodding blue chip stock until just recently. Facebook could have gone belly up as easily as making big gains, after it went public. Tesla is a world unto itself and I would not be surprised if it tanked at any point. (How were you feeling about your FB and Tesla investments in late 2022, BTW?)Investing your life savings into 7 stocks, all in the same sector, carries a higher risk than investing in (actually diversified) mutual funds. You traded risk for return and won big time. This time. You don't say how much money you have invested in each position (and that makes a big difference to most investors in terms of how much risk they are willing to take with individual stocks). If someone handed you the equivalent of your total investments in cash today, would you put it all into those 7 stocks? If not, time to cash out some of your gains and de-risk.And please don't come to Reddit complaining about your capital gains and asking how to avoid paying them.",0,0.53,NEGATIVE,1.0

I’ve been investing for 15 years now and I think I be beat the market or at least the overall S&P500 every single year. There might have been a year that I nominally missed but if you add up all my investments and look at the gains, it’s significantly higher than if I just invested in a boring S&P ETF. My Fidelity account does this for me automatically and I’ve always been higher…for over a decade now. So hear me out, I’ve made some dumb mistakes and lost $$$ along the way but my winners have always offset that. My game plan is pretty simple: always invest in large cap stocks. With a diverse portfolio made up of Microsoft, Nvidia, Facebook (now meta), Amazon, Tesla, Apple, Nvidia, Amd, and a few others, I’ve found this sector completely destroys the overall “market.” Sure I have a few outliers like Home Depot and OLIN but when I look at my pie chart, it’s very aggressive and very heavily in tech. The difference in the S&P vs the NASDAQ confirms this over the last 20 years or more and you could argue I’ve built my own sort of NASDAQ mutual fund in a ways, but I’m still beating the NASDAQ too. The contrarian’s argument is that given enough time, my large cap tech picks will eventually falter and I will begin losing but at the amount I’m up right now, for over a decade, that correction would have to be astronomical and I don’t see how the whole world economy wouldn’t fall if these tech picks crash down 50% at once. I’m not trying to brag or troll this group or anything like that. I’m just genuinely interested to know if tech has made it relatively easy to now beat the overall market, and if so, what consequences does that have on the stability of the whole market if more investors start doing what I’m doing? Is there a point where the “market” is all tech now? It sure feels like the S&P is so heavily weighted by tech now that maybe that’s the real underlying answer to my question.",It’s in another root comment. My 14 year is 875%. My app doesn’t list the 10 year unfortunately,6,0.626,NEGATIVE,0.999
,"Short question, if you invest in the top tech companies, is it easy to beat the marketing meaning the S&P?
