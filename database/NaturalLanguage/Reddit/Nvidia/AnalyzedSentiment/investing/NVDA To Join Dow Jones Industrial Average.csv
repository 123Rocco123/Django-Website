And judging by the number of upvotes you received, neither does most of this sub? The index isn’t there to “maximize gains”. It is there to track the market (in their own suboptimal methodology compared to say the S&P 500); DJIA had also added Amazon (to replace Walgreens) “way too late”, and Amazon would have probably fallen into your own assessment of “not a blue chip” based on its multiples. Intel’s fall has been meteoric in the last few years, just like Nvidia’s rise, and I mean the earnings/influence/impact of the companies, not necessarily the stock price. It would probably have been premature to replace Intel with Nvidia say 5 years ago. Lastly, I’m not sure if there is a dictionary definition of “blue chip”, but in my book it just means highly impactful and reliable household names that will not go away any time soon, and by that definition, Nvidia is definitely a blue chip (despite its high multiples), and its forward P/E is honestly “not even that high” compared to the likes of Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon.",1,0.527,NEGATIVE,0.546
