,"I’m 42 and in great financial standing, but hoping to maximize my already-great returns to retire early. I currently have 60% of my money invested in the market - vanguard - and 40% in a high yield capital one 360 savings account (4.5% return on the latter I believe). 70% of my Vanguard money is in VTSAX, 25% in VTIAX and 5% in VGT. I set the VTSAX and VTIAX up years ago on the advice of someone in this sub, and I added the VGT last year on the advice of a friend (thanks NVIDIA and my friend). My vanguard YTD return percentage at the end of 2023 was 22%, which I thought was pretty great. I worry that I might not have enough real estate exposure because I don’t own any property. I will eventually inherit a valuable farm in Iowa because my father was a farmer, so I haven’t felt the need to get into real estate too heavily. I might purchase an apartment in NYC, where I live, at some point in the next few years. Part of me is convinced the markets will get walloped before 2030, so the idea would be to park my money in real estate before then. Curious to know what you all think. Is the 70% VTSAX + 25% VTIAX allocation still advisable? Any other suggestions? I’m not quite at the $1m mark, but I will be within 2 years if current trends continue.","Not in a place where I can check myself, but you might want to see how much overlap there is between the funds you hold and adjust to reduce overlaps.  I’d add some VXUS to get international exposure. I think you have too much in cash. If you need quick access to cash, put the funds in SNSXX and withdraw as needed. It’s paying about 5% now. A good percentage of the dividends are exempt from state tax, which is important in NY state. ",0,0.51,NEGATIVE,0.991

You’re right about having too much cash. I need to put more in all my vanguard funds. I also have about $15k in bitcoin I could add to. I don’t take crypto too seriously but I’ll hold this bitcoin for a few years to see what happens….maybe buy ethereum too.,3,0.528,POSITIVE,0.999

But I have a rent stabilized apt in an area I absolutely love and my investments - money that would go into purchasing an apt - generate a substantial amount every month. Most of the real estate on the market now is low quality new construction with bad layouts. I’m an architect and I think I value certain things in my living environs that others might not.For example, in Greenpoint where I live, most of the listings for 1 bd apts on Zillow are the same crap layout. A shoebox like space, in terms of proportions, that you walk into lengthwise with kitchen cabinets plastered on the common hall side and oddly proportioned windows on the street or backyard facing side. Usually oddly narrow left to right. Very small bedrooms, sometimes with a balcony, and a small bathroom with a hard-to-clean glass enclosure (photographs well, does not age well). Very limited storage.I can smell the building chemicals and glue when I look at these listings. I can see the water coming through the ceiling and I can hear the crappy, loud HVAC system that’s also pumping in the smell of weed from all my neighbors. And I love smoking weed, I just don’t want to smell everyone else smoking 24/7.Also, all the fees you have to pay for property you buy seem ridiculous in NYC. I sort of concluded that you need funny money here for buying to make any sense. Still, I do look at Zillow occasionally. I just think that living in a rent stabilized apt that I love in an area I love while getting great returns on my investments makes buying seem less attractive.",1,0.519,NEGATIVE,1.0

Curious to hear your thought process, especially because you're worried about a market downturn. I'm not at your level yet (give me a few years!) but a lot of the investors I follow suggest diversifying outside the US if you're worried about a downturn. Maybe allocate a small amount to something like VWO?Also, I'm in a similar boat as a renter in NYC. Prices are nuts. Maybe look into REITs as a way to get some real estate exposure before you pull the trigger on an apartment.",0,0.539,NEGATIVE,0.892
