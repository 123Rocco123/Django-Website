At a minimum, you'll need resources to answer these questions!One of my favorites is:  www.finviz.com",0,0.559,POSITIVE,0.995

Does this fund overlap significantly with other funds -- both of which CAN be ""index"" funds, right?Same questions apply when looking to buy a new fund, too. What sectors do I already own?

What questions do you ask yourself?","Index funds...Expense ratio. For instance, unless you're considering selling covered calls or something, QQQM is lower overhead than QQQ.Form (mutual fund vs ETF)For narrower funds, what the index contains. For instance, VGT tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Information Technology 25/50 Index. You won't be surprised at what's in it, but you might be surprised at what's NOT in it. For instance, AMZN isn't in there even though it's this enormous cloud provider... because it's considered consumer discretionary, since Amazon also sells shit on their website, yeah?For stocks...Beta. Is this a roller coaster, or a cruise?I also calculate something like a pseudo-alpha relative to the S&P 500. I also generate several scenarios like, how I think this will perform when markets are soaring, when they're going up mildly, when they're flat, when they're dropping, when the floor falls out like 2008.I do a sort of generic sharpe ratio calculation as well, comparing to the S&P 500.What sector they're in. You get a general feel for how sectors perform in different environments as well as long-term trends. This page is like a handy cheat-sheet.Correlation with markets in general. For instance, MSFT and the S&P 500 are fairly correlated, so when one goes up, so does the other. But WMT does its own thing, very low correlation to market movements (true of consumer staples in general, since they benefit from a flight to ""safety"" when things go bad. Also true for health care and utilities)Financial situation -- are they carrying debt, do they have healthy cash flow, etc. This can be a 2 minute thing or building an entire financial model thing... I'm gonna be honest, I tend to be closer to the 2 minute thing, mostly just looking for red flags.My opinions on future interest rates, markets, etc... Companies carrying a lot of debt are more at-risk of their expenses going up in a rising rate environment. In theory, they benefit when rates go down, but that's harder to suss out. Very loosely, if you think rates are going up, lean towards value companies with low debt, and when rates peak, maybe lean back towards growth companies. Though I don't know if the latter works this time -- growth companies are doing great even with rates staying kind of high. Similarly, if I think markets are headed for rough waters, looking at companies with weaker market correlation might do well, or at least limit downside.Whether they have some sort of economic moat. Moats tend to provide stability. Take Zoom for instance... They were in the right place at the right time with telework and covid, so easy buy back in March 2020... But no real moat and heavy hitters like Microsoft, Cisco, Adobe are all coming for them, so precarious long-term. I'd have loved to wait for a year for long term capital gains but I wussed out and sold... Turns out that was the right move.The industry they're a part of. Especially if they aren't a leader in their industry. Also looking at competitors in the same industry. You can look at things like profit margins, expected growth rates, etc. and make some inferences on whether they're becoming a more significant or less significant part of the industry they live in. Or if their margins are very different than their competitors, you can try to find out why.Do they have a history of beating or missing revenue expectations?If it's a ""value"" company, dividend history can be interesting. Also, looking at total returns so you can compare more easilyAnalyst recommendations -- not to follow their recommendations because they're usually trend-following crap, but to get an idea of sentiment about the stock. Often stocks perform relative to expectations rather than in some absolute sense, so knowing whether the expectations are high or low can be significant. If you can find beat-down companies with terrible sentiment and you think it's temporary. For instance, banking stocks coming out of the 2008 crisis -- they were beat to hell, had pending lawsuits, everybody abandoning ship... Bank of America dropped from $50/share to less than $6/share. There's risk in buying distressed companies, but there's potential reward. Boeing and Intel would be the poster child for that sort of thing right now... I don't own either except in funds. There's a risk of them just being dead money for a long time.Recent news. Markets may overreact to recent news. This is so well known at this point though that it can be hard to leverage it though. But just for example, during Covid, there was absolute panic about airline stocks -- surely they'll all go out of business because pandemic! If you can time it correctly (and that's a HUGE if), you can capitalize. The government isn't letting all US carriers go bankrupt... I owned United Airlines for 11 days and made 44%. And even though their stock is poison, I tried the same trick with Peleton when they had their big recall thing in 2021. Made 16% in 11 days before wussing out. It just felt so wrong to own such a crap company.Do I like the stock, or some product they make? Like the first time I ate at a Chipotle, I thought that shit is going to explode. And they did... but I never got around to buying in early. Damnit.In general, correlating the things around you with what that could mean for stocks. Like you notice yoga pants are getting popular years ago, maybe time to take a look at LULU?Overall portfolio things. Like am I too heavy in <specific industry>? Is there a good looking stock in an industry I'm not already in? For example, I sold NVDA because I felt like I had too much in semiconductors, which turned out to be a terrible decision... But then again, I've been doing just fine with all those other semiconductor stocks (AVGO, AMAT, KLAC, etc). No use crying of spilled milk.Also note there's a berjillion counterexamples to all of this. Like netflix was phenomenal but the writing was on the wall in terms of streaming fracturing into separate providers that had their own content and would be removing it from netflix, so that'd be a scary AF stock to be in when you can see doom creeping closer. And then Netflix was like ""fuck off, we'll make our own content!"" and it worked! I definitely missed the boat on that one. Then they got absolutely crushed coming out of lockdown and I felt justified... and then they bounced back from under 200 a share to pushing 700 a share right now.Anyway, that's too much. It's a little like a golf swing -- remember all these things, but don't actually think about them too much or you'll paralyze yourself and eff it up. All you're really aiming for is avoiding mistakes you could reasonably avoid, and learning from the mistakes you make so you don't repeat them.And unrelated to ""before you buy""...Track stock performance relative to an index that makes sense. Like if I'm aiming to beat the S&P 500, track how the S&P 500 does alongside the thing you purchased, because that's the opportunity cost. For instance, I bought AMZN in late 2021 and it immediately ate shit. It's now recovered and I'm up 26%... But the S&P 500 is up 54% in that same timeframe. So that was an expensive mistake... Not that I'm planning on selling, but it's going to have to outperform for quite a while for me to even break even with that opportunity cost.The XIRR function in a spreadsheet can be useful for tracking portfolio performance.",0,0.534,NEGATIVE,0.918

I understand the business and make sure they have some future growth driver.3- I read the 10K report, mainly concerned with reading the Management Discussion & Analysis section and understanding every line item of the balance sheet.Then when I am comfortable with the investment (I find it very underpriced with a logical floor to the price) I take an outsized position on the stock, and feel comfortable taking that position and holding.",0,0.534,NEGATIVE,0.777

The disclosures tell you a story, but that story is never complete without the context of the market and the management and the product. When the numbers are good - or bad - it is always a good idea to understand why.Sometimes, disclosures alone tell you a very different story from the picture that emerges when you look past them. I was recently looking at this small cap industrial company which was showing good numbers and reasonable pricing, but when I started looking deeper I realized that they were inflating their income by acquiring (on credit) very specific type of companies in the same industry, with a very specific pattern of goodwill and assets, and that there was an odd involvement of a private investment fund that showed up right after the new CEO and I really can't tell the if the acquisition binge is a legitimate method to grow the business or a setup for a would-be dump. I'm not saying that there is an outright accounting fraud or anything of the sort, it just doesn't read right.
