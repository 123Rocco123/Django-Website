,"I'm a few years into investing, and I've mainly invested in ETFs the entire time. I've made money, but would also like to start researching individual stocks. This is usually discouraged, but I would research stocks in industries I know, like tech, web, and pharma. For example, I made almost as much with my 10% of individual stocks as I did with all 90% of my ETFs. I know I got a bit lucky buying into NVDA relatively early, but I've built my own computers for two decades and always considered them a solid company. However, I didn't predict the need for Nvidia cards during the AI boom. More recently, I have been watching RDDT since its IPO. When it sank to 40.00 shortly after the IPO, I felt it was undervalued and a bargain at that price. One significant predictor for me was that most of my google searches would autocomplete with “reddit” on the end of it. Those were my two huge winners out of nine stocks total. Now, I want to invest around 20-25% in individual stocks, but besides a company's financials, I'm unsure where to find the best independent research, free or paid. Any suggestions you might have would be greatly appreciated.",What are the best resources for research?Check the wiki on the right pane. It has exactly what you're asking for.,0,0.517,POSITIVE,0.999
