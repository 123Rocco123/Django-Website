However, today NVDA kicked ass, and SMH and SOXX have NVDA heavier than XSD does, so having all three can cover your bases better, and since it is a non-taxable account you could switch the percentages around if one of the three was doing significantly better for a quarter than the other two.Edir: I have those three and also PSI and some USD.

Yeah, one thing I came to terms with myself sometime ago was that the fees on the FSELX (vs something super efficient like FXAIX) didn't matter in the grand scheme given the outsized returns.FSELX has a much bigger percentage in Nvidia.

But 1/4 is pretty high, and with the huge jump today, I decided I'll switch over some to the ETFs for diversification.(It's actually hard to compare the performance on these different funds because in 2018, FSELX did a 10 for 1 split, and I don't think charting tools are reflecting that properly [at least Yahoo Finance is not].)",2,0.517,0.998,NEGATIVE
