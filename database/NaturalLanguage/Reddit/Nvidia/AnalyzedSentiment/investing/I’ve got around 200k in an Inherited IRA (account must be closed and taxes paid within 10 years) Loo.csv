The stock market will crash as inflation soars.Reality check: deporting millions of illegal immigrants will kill the construction industry, sending housing prices higher; it will destroy agriculture as those who harvest will be gone, sending food prices soaring; it will severely crimp the restaurant business… etc. And tariffs are taxes placed on good sold here — raising the price of those goods. No, we cannot instantly start domestically producing all the things we import from China, Mexico, etc. Prices will go up. The easily-duped Trumpers who blamed Biden for pandemic-related inflation and thought Trump was “good for the economy” are going to get a rude awakening.Fox “news” and Russian propaganda will tell the willfully ignorant it’s not Trump’s fault but reality will show itself at the checkout line.So don’t invest that money in stocks.
