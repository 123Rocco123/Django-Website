,"Apologies for how political this is. I couldn't see in the rules any issue relating to posting political-related discussion, but this is a very relevant and important question I'd like to discuss among investors, seeing the growing tensions between the US and China. The majority of my stocks are in US companies, despite not living in the US, so I will be effected regardless. Looking at history, war time isn't necessarily economic woe for all companies. During WWII the Ford company supplied the US military with vehicles and war supplies. Other companies were similarly pulled in, and many actually greatly benefitted from their involvement in some way or another. The question is, what do you all think could be some notable winners, losers, or companies who are able to pull through (whether they win or not)? Of course I see companies like Nvidia and Intel being heavily involved in supplying chip technology and research to the US military. I'm sure Apple is in a similar position. Are there any winners though?","I think you pretty much got it. European and US chip companies will be the major winners. If the EU gets its act together and starts investing in local chip production using US based techonolgy, it can provide them with a buffer against China while also not relying too much on Taiwanese production (which as we know is in the danger zone).",0,0.539,0.999,POSITIVE

Tesla will likely also have to contribute with their battery and power technology.Of course when I say winners, I mean ""winners"". But those ""winners"" will be very different than the ones in WWII. (since war has changed so much, robotics/ai, cyber security and microtechnology will likely play a bigger role. Then there's ofc steel and oil extraction and production which will also be crucial...)",1,0.546,0.988,POSITIVE

Don’t forget anyone who uses the Tesla supercharger network is having their data collected. That is a huge goldmine for the US government and for Tesla itself.",2,0.522,0.997,NEGATIVE

Not that war time is exciting or anything, war doesn't help the economy at all, besides a boom for the winners afterwards. But I think as investors, it's always important to consider the possibilities and how you can adapt.Great brainstorming with you! Thanks, many people who've commented have either shut down the idea or given the ""everyone loses and we're all doomed"" answer which doesn't really help lol.",3,0.51,0.999,POSITIVE

Maybe selling a bunch of F-15 and F-18 is just what Boeing needs to put the 737max issue fully behind them. The Ukrainian conflict shows that rockets and missles are critical to modern warfare; don't overlook those suppliers. The guidance/jamming is key too. While chips are critical, they aren't the only parts. What about metals and minerals? What about ASML, the equipment to manufacture chips (Disclaimer: I hold a small position)?",0,0.516,0.963,NEGATIVE

Take Boeing as an example, BA was sanctioned by the Chinese for its military products. To say its commercial jetliners are not to be used in China is doing the company a disservice. BA also acquires its components frames from China. Intel may benefit but it has not been a major player for at least 10 years supplying a mere 9.6% world supply. Apple may suffer. Supply chain parts shortage. Many parts except processor are sourced in China not elsewhere. When there is disruption, the numbers won't look good. Nvda chip is coming from the most advanced wafer fab in Taiwan.
