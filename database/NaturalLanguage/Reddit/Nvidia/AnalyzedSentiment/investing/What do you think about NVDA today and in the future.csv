,"Hi, What do you think about NVDA? Does it seem overvalued to you as of today? I think Nvidia's FSD platform might create a monopoly in the future, even beating TSLA in their own game. Their gpu division is also going well. https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/NVDA/summary Thanks",Bullish long term. Bearish short. GPU sales just hit a new low since 2005. Their last several products (4080/4070ti) are horrible value and not moving at retailers. Crypto mining is gone. Earnings are in a downward trend. Add in the fear of a recession and discretionary spending will be pulled back. Lots of companies and people will find no reason to upgrade GPU’s in this environment when forced to either do layoffs or buy groceries.Personally I’d treat them like a cyclical stock.,0,0.549,NEGATIVE,1.0

By far. 2022 was just a small preview of what's to come on the AI front in the coming years. I'm not sure who will be the software leader (I think it will be between GOOG vs MSFT/OpenAI ), but it is clear that the chipmakers will benefit. The compute necessary to run these models is insane and there is simply going to be growing demand for cloud GPUs. AI will be multi trillion market by the end of the decade and NVDA and TSM will surely benefit. I've invested in both. Short term pain possible and even likely though.
