,"Hi all, Before starting, I'll just point out that most of my portfolio is index funds and ETFs. But I do have maybe 10-15% in single stocks, just to satisfy the inner (wannabe) Buffett. So we've all heard the advice that diversification is important when building a portfolio. Correct me if wrong, but this can mean across different stocks, or by diversifying across assets, like stocks and real estate. I was looking for some online calculator that could find the correlation between two stocks and found this: https://www.buyupside.com/calculators/stockcorrelationinput.php It lets you put two stocks and the time period to calculate the correlation between. Could something like this be used just as a rudimentary tool. Either to see how whether you're actually as diversified as you think or to see you're not over concentrating in one area. Like investing in 5 different popular tech giants, which seems to be a thing some people do. However, some results I found were a bit strange so not sure if that means using figures like these are not so useful? Eg, apple and Goldman Sachs had a correction of 0.8585 over the past 5 years and 0.9058 over the last 10 years. Or Nvidia and PepsiCo also having a correlation just over 0.85. Are these figures just because stocks have generally all gone up over these time periods so the end result would be that mathematically they are correlated? Even though they are completely different industries/business models? So can mathemical concepts/figures like these be useful, or do they not mean much since they are backwards looking, and it's better to diversify by knowledge of the different businesses. Such as, we might say intuitively that Apple and PepsiCo should be uncorrelated, no matter what price history suggests? A final thought I'd like to hear opinions on, would be choosing from different industries based on the most diversification available. Eg, you pick Microsoft and apple in the tech sector (not in your portfolio, just as two options available) and PG and PEP in, not sure the exact industry name, but say consumer products? You've done whatever prior research you saw fit to arrive at these businesses and now want to narrow things down for whatever reason. And then have a 2*2 matrix with the different correlations between pairs. If there is a pair that might have significantly lower correlation than the other three, maybe you could pick that? Or is this still not very useful?",You can use correlation to weight your portfolio for risk parity: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2708678Correlation between stocks won't get you very far because most stocks are very correlated to all other stocks. Their primary return-compensating risk is the broad market factor. You could use correlation to build a highly diversified portfolio across various assets.,0,0.531,NEGATIVE,0.917

So adding a single stock (for example) that even has a negative correlation of -1 is useless if it only 5% of a portfolio where 95% is sp500. The impact to the total return of the portfolio is too low.The problem then is adding too much weight to ONE stock is adding nonsystematic risk for no reason (no expected return for increased risk). Not good.Then your only option is adding a whole bunch of stocks with all low correlations to each other just for the purposes of low correlation and not based on any other reason. Not a great idea either.So the bang for you buck will be to add this to the asset class level. Now the HOLY GRAIL of investing is to add asset classes with 1. negative correlation (one zigs while the other zags) and 2. High volatility (equity like return, so you get same level of return as equities and don't lose return out of it). This holy grail does NOT exist. Many a man/ woman has tried and failed. In reality when you attempt to add low correlating asset classes to an equity portfolio what you get is a lower volatility in exchange for lower return.Things folks have tried is adding: Gold, bonds, commodities, TIPS, and long term treasuries. Those tend to be the best. Other stuff like tangible real estate/ timber/ farmland are GREAT but have high illiquidity/ transaction costs/ barriers of entry/ opacity/ management fees/ etc...Now one you may like is to just add to stock index portfolio and being a Buffett fan is: Berkshire Hathaway. It is just more stocks, but I remember it does have lower correlation coefficients ESPECIALLY during bear markets (where you want it to work the most which is when stocks go down the toilet). Easy to add, easy to manage, adds some lower correlation, adds some protection in bear markets, and safe to add 10% to it without fear of it going down the toilet (NOT because of Buffett but because it has so many stocks in the stock itself so it is sort of a mini fund itself).Hope this helps.",0,0.526,NEGATIVE,1.0

If you compare these, they will naturally have high correlation. Basically you are measuring a hidden correlation to the market.Your approach goes in the direction of Markowitz, or black Litterman.",0,0.555,NEGATIVE,0.777
