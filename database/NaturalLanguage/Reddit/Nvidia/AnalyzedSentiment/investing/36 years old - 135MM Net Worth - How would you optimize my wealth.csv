Would prob just do VTI,VXUS split. Also international is underweighted IMO, should aim for something closer to market cap. 60/40 Us/international.The third thing is, and this is take it or leave it advice, I would avoid getting a vacation home. They are a huge drain on (enjoyable) time and money, and you would be better served just renting places for the few weeks you’ll all be free. Unless you’re planning on FIRE or taking 6 months of vacation a year or something like that. Same goes for boats, second houses, nice cars.I feel that way because my own father literally wasted years of making 700k plus on huge houses, a 15 meter yacht, sports cars. And now he’s no longer employed, and is nowhere near being prepared for retirement. Obviously you guys didn’t get to where you are by being financially irresponsible, but it’s a slippery slope. One thing than another and suddenly your 65 and not prepared to retire.You should be dispassionate about what the costs are if you do decide to get a vacation home. How do those costs compare to just renting.Just like my opinion. Like I said take it or leave it. Like others have said you’re off to a great start.",0,0.531,1.0,NEGATIVE

I think the reality is we have multiple active and rolled over retirement accounts that are limited in what we can invest in with little choice. However, fair point on our individual taxable accounts, will look to keep simple and always pile into fewer positions ongoing to simplify. 2) Agree on underweight on Int’l and will look to pile more in there and 3) this one hurts, and I think I’m thinking clearly and stable in terms of portfolio, so this may be the one area where I’m straying into the irresponsible or frivolous zone.

You’ve either picked or ended up at slightly different ratios, but is you purposefully picked relative weightings, then rebalance periodically (esp. in tax sheltered accounts).Perhaps favour Roths over non-Roths as pesky RMDs will make you take income in your 70s.I‘ll echo what others have said re vacation home, obv. might make sense to have somewhere where you go every other weekend, etc., but having somewhere to use for a week or two per year at the same ol’ ski resort a six hour flight away might be more hassle than it’s worth (unless that’s the business your in, and/or you have people for that). We stay in different condos for 3-6 weeks 3 or 4 times a year, get to see different places, etc. etc.Anyway, excellent, sounds exciting, and you’re well on your way, congratulations 🎉",0,0.539,0.999,NEGATIVE

Keep it up.As others have mentioned, a 529 for education of your kids or (future) grandkids could also be a good move. I started 529s when my children were born and funded them with every paycheck. I'll now be able to afford at least a good undergraduate degree for them at a public university.Do you have access to an HSA? You must have a high-deductible health insurance plan in order to qualify for one. They're extremely tax-efficient and if you have low medical expenses, a high-deductible plan isn't a huge issue. I got an HSA last year, and I really like it. Remember that when you retire, especially if you retire early, you will likely have greatly increased medical expenses and an HSA can be used for those expenses.You don't mention your tax situation very thoroughly. So consider whether you should be in Roth or traditional retirement accounts. I've thus far decided that Roth (401k and IRA) is best for my family because I see that US debt is increasing and tax rates are historically low. I don't see tax rates going anywhere but up. Of course, Congress can vote to tax Roth accounts at any time, so there's risk there. When my wife starts working again, we might be earning enough to warrant (or force) us to switch to traditional accounts.This is the big one. You say your risk appetite is high. I also think that mine is high. However, you and I have not seen a significant recession in our working lives, or rather, since we've had enough wealth to worry about a recession. I think this fact tends to make people believe that their risk appetite is higher than it actually is. Put another way, it's easy to be risky when you've only ever seen things go up. So, take a really hard, honest look at what a loss of 50% might do to your psyche. Maybe get some advice if you think that it would be hard for you to deal with.You seem to have a lot in cash and savings for my tastes. This is obviously a very personal decision, as to what helps you sleep at night, so take this with a grain of salt. Personally, I keep about 3% or less of my worth in cash or savings. When money is in cash, it's not earning for me, and I want as much of my money as possible to be earning for me. I have a small ""emergency"" fund in cash, but I also realize that all of my contributions to my (and my wife's) Roth IRA can be withdrawn without penalty. That is, effectively, a very large emergency fund.",0,0.526,0.997,POSITIVE

Thanks in advance for your advice.",Seems you are over diversified in your liquid equity allocation and technically over invested in cash given your age.With that said cash allocations are highly dependent on salary stability and your goals. Given your modest goals a high cash allocation is reasonable but the textbook allocation suggestion would be allocating your high yield savings account into a fixed income portfolio.Regarding your equity allocation over diversification is an operational drag but doesn't impact portfolio performance overly negatively.Without further details it seems your portfolio is relatively illiquid. Retirement and real estate portfolios have large transaction and tax costs to liquidate or reallocate.Instead of an asset allocation reallocation I would suggest working to diversify your account types to increase liquidity.I'd encourage you to consider adding some leverage to your portfolio. Debt in your 30s with a sizable asset base is an efficient way of adding liquidity and current income with a 1mm plus portfolio.,0,0.526,1.0,NEGATIVE
