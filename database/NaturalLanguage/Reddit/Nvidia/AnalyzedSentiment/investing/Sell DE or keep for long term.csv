,My father just passed on and I inherited his portfolio. I see that he bought John Deere in 2022 and has lost the entire time (he also bought a boatload of Nvidia at the time which brought a smile to my face). He also has a couple other positions I‚Äôm going to talk to my advisor about but DE seems to me like I need to unload. I just don‚Äôt see them strengthening. Any thoughts?,The one plus factor is DE could be an infrastructure play but with political uncertainty it probably better to place in VOO.,0,0.518,NEGATIVE,0.993

Any thoughts?,"Just do today what makes sense for today, including tax implications.Deere is up 18% for three years, which is not thrilling but better than having the money in bonds. It's also up 145% for five years, so it was a more exciting stock when your father bought it. But it's not so exciting today.If you don't have a special desire to own many industrials going forward, I don't see any reason to keep Deere as single stock. There are plenty of other better choices out there going forward from today.",0,0.559,NEGATIVE,0.924

Any thoughts?,"Deere is a fantastic company, it tends to trade with crop prices. I trade deere often over the years. it tends to have big moves for a few months at a time in either direction. I am starting to wonder if its consolidating now, I have been looking for an entry but nothing looks that appetizing. But if I owned it currently I would not be selling here either. Listen to earnings call, they typically indicate if things look good for the near future,,,,good luck",0,0.541,NEGATIVE,0.996

Any thoughts?,"Maybe trim, but a complete sale would have large tax implications. Dont know if you have any positions with a loss that you could sell at same time to offset gains. I think Deere is the most misunderstood large company out there. Most analysts dont understand the technology side of farming, DE has been growing its subscription business by leaps and bounds.....Good Luck",2,0.551,NEGATIVE,0.999
