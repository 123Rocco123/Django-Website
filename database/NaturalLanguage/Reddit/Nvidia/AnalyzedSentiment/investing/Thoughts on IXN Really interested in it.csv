,"So I've been just investing on S&P500 ( SWPPX) and another eVtol company. Been so interested in SMH as well, but wanted more general TECH exposure. I stumbled into IXN. I like how it has the top 3 tech (microsoft, apple, nvidia) and then some semi conductors (some international) - I like TSM a lot. Wish the percentage was bigger. Wondering if it's weird to have 50% SWPPX 25% IXN 25% my eVtol bet. I know SWPPX and IXN has like 50% overlap but that just increases my weight on some companies. On the other hand should I just VT + IXN? If there's other tech ETF pls recommend! I know expense ratio is .41 kinda high but fine with me.","If you just want US tech, there are cheaper options like XLK, FTEC, and VGT (0.08-0.10%, as opposed to 0.41% for IXN). IXN is different though because of its international exposure, with its holdings including Taiwan Semiconductor, ASML, and Samsung. Historically it hasnâ€™t done quite as well as the US funds, but who knows what the future holds?",0,0.521,NEGATIVE,0.999

Always good to have that, especially from a Tech war that's about to be unleashed. Also looks like YTD return, IXN is doing better than QQQ.",1,0.531,POSITIVE,0.98

Or just overlapping issues? Yeah I honestly just like some of the international exposures.,1,0.511,NEGATIVE,0.927
