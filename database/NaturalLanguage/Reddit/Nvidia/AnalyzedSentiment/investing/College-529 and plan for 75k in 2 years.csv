,"My 529 recently has 5% investment return. I know literally nothing about investing, and taxes besides I can maximize tax breaks before December each year. I'd appreciate any steps, general advice, invest in like Amazon, Nvidia, Legos, sites or programs to trust where I invest, and transfer between accounts. I have $10k in my savings, $10k in 529, and $50k of inheritance recently given 2 months ago (that I'm told i would face a lot of taxes if I pulled out big sums). I'm estimating $13k before July, and 62k for July 2025-May 2027. I am expecting to be paid $20-48k for those 2 years. What, where, and who should I go to? Any advice of reality checks like masters does recieve fiancial aid? Details and how I calculated this: I have $6000 in tuition left, and $2750 in apartment rerent left. I would like to pay $600 to tint my car I have worked for, and government helped for my family disabilities that ended after I left highschool. I estimate about $3000 in food for 8 months. I would like to seek a Master's in management and public relations that's about $36k in tution and those hidden fees. $17k for housing if I stay for 2 years. $9k for food. My job prediction for next year 2025 to 2027 could $20-48k afer tax if I found a $15-20 hourly job and kept it.","you should invest in VTI, not individual stocks.your 529 can be used tax free for school and board so take advantage of that, but also it's a good idea to start an IRA and put 7k, I recommend opening a fidelity account (google Fidelity Traditional IRA)This inheritance is a gift and a massive boon, do not spend it frivolously or try to gamble it away on things like Legos and NVDA.",0,0.518,NEGATIVE,0.984

Should i use my savings for the account, or the inheritance that I could face taxes for? Then, I use my 529 rn.Should i invest vti regularly in small amounts, or one big amount?",1,0.524,NEGATIVE,0.997

I have my siblings on the same plan eith smaller amounts - i think if you have the 529 leftovers that's going to be a great benefit to yourself after school.",2,0.529,NEGATIVE,0.963
