If you want broader exposure, the SMH ETF is great and I see it's been mentioned in others' comments. I think Alphabet presents a more compelling value-based case. Nvidia is just weird. People have been calling this a bubble for over a year and bears keep obliterated betting against NVDA and friends. Sentiment around the company is still very bullish.That said, there's always risk. In the near term, political instability around and after the US presidential election could rattle markets. Mid-term, there is ruinous geopolitical risk with the industry's exposure to Taiwan. There could also just be a slow realization in these companies' accounting departments that the actual costs of using AI don't justify the productivity and financial gains, though that's more likely to be on a firm by firm basis.I'd buy into SMH.

That means you know it's not logically a good idea and you are looking for reassurance. This is known as FOMO and it is the downfall of many retail investors.However, if you can switch off your emotions and look objectively at the hard facts, there is nothing wrong with investing in some individual stocks. GOOG is not crazy overvalued at this point and has a realistic chance of increasing profits in the future from AI. However, it's also not a screaming buy and there's nothing to tell me it will outperform the market based on current valuation and growth rate.So in summary if you find a stock with solid fundamentals, compelling valuation and competetive advantage and a high probability of outperforming the market, then go for it. But otherwise, indexes already include these big stocks in the same weighting believed by the market. So you are already invested in them in best ratio that the market as a whole believes in.
