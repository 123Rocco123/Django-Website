,"Hello, I just started investing last month into Roth IRA. Honestly have always been a fan of Nvidia with my GPUs etc, however never had proper financial education until recently.

Wondering if it's smart to invest in individual stocks like SMH into Roth? Which one is less risky? Smh or ndva? Thank you!!","And ETF by definition should be less risky than an individual stock. SMH is about 1/4th NVDA, with the rest being major chip players that effectively have been riding the NVDA wave.That said, if NVDA starts getting some competition from the likes of intel, AMD, etc., NVDA will decrease while the others increase, theoretically playing well for SMH over NVDA.I’m bullish on SMH and AI in general, but so it the entire market right now. Is it too late? No. Do I think SMH is less risky than NVDA? Yes. Do I have a crystal ball to tell you that investing right now is a mistake? No.Don’t risk more than you are willing to lose, be grateful for the gains, learn lessons from the losses, and happy hunting.",0,0.546,0.973,NEGATIVE

April 2023 revenue was 7.19 billion. July 2023 revenue was 13.51 billion. October 2023 it was 18.12 billion. January 2024 it was 22.1 billion.  They guided 24 billion for next quarter.

They have a forward PE in the 30s, with basically unlimited pricing power, a product which at the moment no one can even come close to matching. They will sell every GPU they can make.

By the time their competition catch up to where they currently are, NVDA will already have designed the next generation GPU.NVDA is cheap at these prices. Seriously. They currently have zero meaningful competition and all the demand in the world. This stock should already be over $1000 per share.",3,0.547,1.0,NEGATIVE
