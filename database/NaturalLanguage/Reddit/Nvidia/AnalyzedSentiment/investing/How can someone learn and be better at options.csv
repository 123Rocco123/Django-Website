,"HowI just now started trading a couple months ago I bought about 10k worth of shares in Nvidia and it doing me very well. But I have been trying to learn options and in this month alone I’m down $5000. I try to use paper money but I think that didn’t help because I had no emotions in it.

In roulette if it was 5 reds in a row are you guaranteed a red next? NO! Its still a 50/50. trend lines can be useful but at the end of the day its still gambling.20% of options traders are profitable. That's worse than roulette.link,4,0.515,1.0,NEGATIVE

Are you selling calls to generate premium while cutting off the right tail of your equity risk premium? Are you selling puts to collect premium while attempting to buy into a fund/stock at a lower price?Theres non-gambling options plays, but most people see monkey lottery returns on calls and puts and treat options like an embedded leverage tool to make directional bets on stocks, while not understanding how all the greeks are gonna fuck you, like theta decay being higher on short duration cheap options or gamma or vega and so on.",4,0.515,1.0,NEGATIVE

Nobody is requiring you to trade options. My investing is 90% recurring contributions to core long positions, and 10% trading around them when I see a setup I like. Typically when a company misses earnings and dumps way harder than the earnings miss reflects, I buy calls for the gap fill. Alternatively, if the market gaps down on some overnight news that doesn't actually affect the ability for companies to make money, I buy calls (another gap play). If I look at portfolio returns over 1 week, 1 month etc. and my eyes get big, I buy protective puts. This may mean making one options trade a month, if that. Oh well.

For the protective puts however, I usually just buy on index ETFs, usually SPY.I know you didn't ask, but based on some of your comments on this thread I'd also like to add that you can't cling to every options trade like it's the one that will change your life.

There is much more risk involved, but if your strategy considers the risk with the potential gain, you’ll make money in the long run, slowly. Just to be clear, good trading strategies are not as fast as the one-off degen yolos on WSB. That IS gambling.Watch tasty trade videos on youtube. They are excellent for learning.After getting a basic understanding of options and the greeks, look into vertical credit spreads. They have defined risk. tasty trade can explain what makes for a good put/call credit spread. You’ll make more money than VOO if you are disciplined, but it takes TIME, like work. You have to actually look into standard deviations and Implied volatility. If you aren’t willing to put in part-time job amount of time into options trading, you’ll likely just buy calls or puts because it’s easy to accomplish and lose your money.TL;DR If you don’t have the time and discipline, don’t bother with options.

I do think my main problem is to get rich quickly and I’m doing very short strike prices with almost no time for it to develop. Would you guys recommend to pick longer exp?","You may want to understand the mechanics with simpler option strategies first - maybe short put and covered call strategies.It sounds from your post that you have been trading long option strategies with short dte contracts - those are low probability trades, high reward trades which aren't well suited to new traders. There's a reason why they were called fd's on wsb.If option trading is new to you - you probably ought to learn more first.There is a list of recommended books on options and derivatives in the wiki here - https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/readinglist/#wiki_options_and_derivativesYou can start with one of those books.The OIC or Options Industry Council is a service by the OCC whose members are the various option exchanges in the US like the NYSE and CBOE. Link here - https://www.optionseducation.org/ There are webinars that you can attend and free blog articles. The Getting Started section here - https://www.optionseducation.org/optionsoverview/getting-started-with-options is a great place to start.The CBOE which is the largest listed options exchange in the US provides free education at the Options Institute here - https://www.cboe.com/optionsinstitute/",2,0.521,0.952,NEGATIVE
,"HowI just now started trading a couple months ago I bought about 10k worth of shares in Nvidia and it doing me very well. But I have been trying to learn options and in this month alone I’m down $5000. I try to use paper money but I think that didn’t help because I had no emotions in it. What do you guys do to get better at trading options because I’m struggling, but I do want to get better at this so I can make extra money. I do think my main problem is to get rich quickly and I’m doing very short strike prices with almost no time for it to develop. Would you guys recommend to pick longer exp?",I really appreciate this. I hope you have the greatest holidays. Cheers !,3,0.502,0.997,POSITIVE

It allows you to make a little extra on shares you own as long as you are ok with the sale price if the option is exercised.Playing other options is normally not a winning strategy. 90% of people who try to do options lose money. Professionals love getting novice retail guys into options as they get to take your money.,0,0.516,0.717,POSITIVE
