,"The closer we get to the expected lowering of interest rates, the more I'm looking into purchasing Bond UCITS ETFs (I live in the UK, meaning we can't buy the usual US ETFs like BND due to regulations). A lot of fund managers have mentioned that this is once-in-a-generation opportunity to buy bonds and I tend to agree. Obviously, they have some vested interest in it, but the bullish case is clear. If interest rates drop, then bonds prices will go up as yield and price move in opposite directions. Therefore, if the Fed and the BOE lower interest rates as expected in August/September, the logical conclusion is for those Bond UCITS to go up in price. (We saw the ECB, Bank of Canada and the Swiss Bank lower rates, but I'm guessing these didn't have as much weight as the Fed or they were simply tentative/not convincing enough). If interest rates do not drop, then at least you'll keep getting a relatively good (historically for the last 15 years) yield on your bonds, therefore making some decent passive income. Obviously, interest rates can also go up, but I think by this point, the chances are pretty much non-existent for that scenario even though it was being mentioned a lot a few months ago. Now, the next question here is: Which Bond UCITS are the best to get? Ones like iShares Global Aggregate Bond Market (£AGGG) or something riskier like Emerging Markets Bonds (£SEMB)? Here, my expectation is that AGGG would be safer, but returns could be higher with the likes of SEMB. What would the expected price gain be like? Would it be 5%/10%/20% bearing in mind that rates are NOT expected to go back down to 0.5% like before, but somewhere in the range of 2.5%-3%? Is the opportunity cost of not going into equities worth it, e.g. would equities stand a better chance of a gain in the same scenario? Personally, it feels like the US market is on the edge of a precipice given the price movement so far this year of companies like Nvidia. I'm getting a bubbly feeling and it seems like bonds are now a much more attractive alternative than they were 6 months ago. Schroders made an interesting article about that - https://www.schroders.com/en/global/individual/insights/how-do-stocks-bonds-and-cash-perform-when-the-fed-starts-cutting-rates-/ - and from the look of it, equities tend to outperform bonds in most scenarios UNLESS there is a recession in which case bond investors tend to do a bit better. However, most of the times we've seen rate cuts, there's also been a recession (again, check the Schroders article). I've also seen that cutting rates usually ends up being a bearish indicator for the stock market although, again, that probably depends on whether there's going to be a recession. I personally haven't ventured into them yet. Looking at the price of AGGG, it looks like there's still a good buying opportunity. However, the fund's returns so far have not been stellar (worth pointing out that it was started in 2019 so the returns are only showing returns in near-zero interest rate) and the current yield is just under 3% which is not that great at all. On the other hand, SEMB has had much better returns and a higher yield of 6.18% which makes it more appealing, but it seems much riskier given its biggest exposure is to countries like Turkey, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, etc. What do you think of this? Are you getting some bonds or not? If so, which UCITS do you prefer?",What would be an ideal bond term etf to hold today? 7-10 year or longer? As old bonds roll off and newer ones come in wouldn’t that increase the price of the ETF?,0,0.575,NEGATIVE,0.983

Both have the same yield - the price of the old ones fall to deliver higher yield.There is no generally ideal bond term to hold assuming you don't have an edge on the market. If there was one that was better than others, market participants would buy it up, pulling its yield down until it's equal in expectation to other bonds.Longer term bonds are more volatile and should have a little more term premium. Insofar as bonds are uncorrelated (or even better anticorrelated) to stocks, they make a good diversifier in a stock heavy portfolio. They are also good if you want to match a longer term liability, or if you want to express an active view that yields will fall (prices rise).Shorter term bonds are less volatile, approaching cash as the term goes to zero. They are better for derisking and certainty of market value.",1,0.544,NEGATIVE,0.99

,"The closer we get to the expected lowering of interest rates, the more I'm looking into purchasing Bond UCITS ETFs (I live in the UK, meaning we can't buy the usual US ETFs like BND due to regulations). A lot of fund managers have mentioned that this is once-in-a-generation opportunity to buy bonds and I tend to agree. Obviously, they have some vested interest in it, but the bullish case is clear. If interest rates drop, then bonds prices will go up as yield and price move in opposite directions. Therefore, if the Fed and the BOE lower interest rates as expected in August/September, the logical conclusion is for those Bond UCITS to go up in price. (We saw the ECB, Bank of Canada and the Swiss Bank lower rates, but I'm guessing these didn't have as much weight as the Fed or they were simply tentative/not convincing enough). If interest rates do not drop, then at least you'll keep getting a relatively good (historically for the last 15 years) yield on your bonds, therefore making some decent passive income. Obviously, interest rates can also go up, but I think by this point, the chances are pretty much non-existent for that scenario even though it was being mentioned a lot a few months ago. Now, the next question here is: Which Bond UCITS are the best to get? Ones like iShares Global Aggregate Bond Market (£AGGG) or something riskier like Emerging Markets Bonds (£SEMB)? Here, my expectation is that AGGG would be safer, but returns could be higher with the likes of SEMB. What would the expected price gain be like? Would it be 5%/10%/20% bearing in mind that rates are NOT expected to go back down to 0.5% like before, but somewhere in the range of 2.5%-3%? Is the opportunity cost of not going into equities worth it, e.g. would equities stand a better chance of a gain in the same scenario? Personally, it feels like the US market is on the edge of a precipice given the price movement so far this year of companies like Nvidia. I'm getting a bubbly feeling and it seems like bonds are now a much more attractive alternative than they were 6 months ago. Schroders made an interesting article about that - https://www.schroders.com/en/global/individual/insights/how-do-stocks-bonds-and-cash-perform-when-the-fed-starts-cutting-rates-/ - and from the look of it, equities tend to outperform bonds in most scenarios UNLESS there is a recession in which case bond investors tend to do a bit better. However, most of the times we've seen rate cuts, there's also been a recession (again, check the Schroders article). I've also seen that cutting rates usually ends up being a bearish indicator for the stock market although, again, that probably depends on whether there's going to be a recession. I personally haven't ventured into them yet. Looking at the price of AGGG, it looks like there's still a good buying opportunity. However, the fund's returns so far have not been stellar (worth pointing out that it was started in 2019 so the returns are only showing returns in near-zero interest rate) and the current yield is just under 3% which is not that great at all. On the other hand, SEMB has had much better returns and a higher yield of 6.18% which makes it more appealing, but it seems much riskier given its biggest exposure is to countries like Turkey, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, etc. What do you think of this?

Rather, the central bank saw growth slowing and tried to goose it with a rate cut before the recession hit. So, I'm not worried about an upcoming rate cut crashing the market. I also don't think the AI bubble is ready to pop, though I expect occasional pull-backs as investors take profits, so the rate of return on equities will be lower than it's been for the past year.",0,0.543,POSITIVE,0.899
,"The closer we get to the expected lowering of interest rates, the more I'm looking into purchasing Bond UCITS ETFs (I live in the UK, meaning we can't buy the usual US ETFs like BND due to regulations). A lot of fund managers have mentioned that this is once-in-a-generation opportunity to buy bonds and I tend to agree. Obviously, they have some vested interest in it, but the bullish case is clear. If interest rates drop, then bonds prices will go up as yield and price move in opposite directions. Therefore, if the Fed and the BOE lower interest rates as expected in August/September, the logical conclusion is for those Bond UCITS to go up in price. (We saw the ECB, Bank of Canada and the Swiss Bank lower rates, but I'm guessing these didn't have as much weight as the Fed or they were simply tentative/not convincing enough). If interest rates do not drop, then at least you'll keep getting a relatively good (historically for the last 15 years) yield on your bonds, therefore making some decent passive income. Obviously, interest rates can also go up, but I think by this point, the chances are pretty much non-existent for that scenario even though it was being mentioned a lot a few months ago. Now, the next question here is: Which Bond UCITS are the best to get? Ones like iShares Global Aggregate Bond Market (£AGGG) or something riskier like Emerging Markets Bonds (£SEMB)?
