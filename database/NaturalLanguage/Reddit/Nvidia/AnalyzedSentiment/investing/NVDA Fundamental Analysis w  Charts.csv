,"There is no shortage of dollars or bullshit when it comes to NVDA, the world's AI GPU hero of heroes. And with NVDA's revenue and profits not just increasing but multiplying in such a short timespan, investors want to know is it still a good time to buy, to catch the AI wave, as it builds and crashes upon the world, both that of capital investment and the greater world at large. Revenue and profits multiplying: https://imgur.com/oOetNo4 https://imgur.com/caOkRlh And here’s the chart that shows the impact of ChatGPT on the share price and earnings: https://imgur.com/SxhIF9z The top line is the price investors are paying. The bottom line is what those investors are getting, so to speak (NVDA’s net income over the previous year (trailing twelve months)) The vertical line roughly represents ChatGPT hitting 100m users with the line at 2023 January 1st and ChatGPT reportedely hitting 100m users sometime in that month of January according to Reuters and The Guardian. Reuters: https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/ The Guardian: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/02/chatgpt-100-million-users-open-ai-fastest-growing-app The firm will present you with the basic facts about NVDA, not as, and never as, a financial recommendation, but as an introduction to its financials, to give you a better idea if it's even worth your time to further explore NVDA as a company and potential vehicle of investment. The firm does not want you to be falsely misled into thinking we can offer you expertise on NVDA, we cannot. We can however answer the questions that we would expect any man who'd risk his capital to answer. How much money does NVDA make? How much do they have? And you would think, most importantly, how much has NVDA paid their previous investors so far? And while we don't believe the answers to these questions to justify investment, this firm adamantly believes that not knowing the answers to these questions is unacceptable for those who do or would choose to buy common stock in NVDA. In short, you'd have to be a fucking idiot to lend your money to a company without reading our charts and commentary, or the equivalent there of. To assess the full risk of NVDA however, will require a much deeper dive than a single blog post can provide. Let’s take a look at what investors were thinking during the ChatGPT hype and whether that investment panned out at a fundamental rather than speculative level. In other words, did NVDA actually make more money or did its share price just go up? https://imgur.com/wRnNWlD This graph shows what percentage of NVDA’s share price was being represented by the money it had made (ttm net income/shares/share price). This 10 year low during 2023, shows unequivically that there was in fact investment hype during this time, that the price per earnings went very high as people were willing to accept less than 1% earnings just to get in on the hype. Why would investors accept such low earnings per dollar? Because these investors anticipated that the rapid adoption of ChatGPT and the AI hype around it, would mean a growth for NVDA that would more than make up for the price they paid. So were they dumb? Did they overpay? Let’s find out! For our example, we’ll imagine an investor that bought sometime in February after the 100m user threshold was announced: February 15th, 2023 $22.75 price $0.175 net income $0.175/$22.75 = ~0.8% December 10th, 2024 ~$2.57 net income $2.57/$22.17 = ~11% If an investor had bought sometime in February after the news of the 100m users was released. Let’s say for example February 15th at a closing price of approximately $22.75 per share they would have bought when NVDA’s trailing twelve month net income was about $0.175 (17.5 cents) per share, or about 0.8% of the price of the share at that time. Today, those same shares carry about $2.57 per share, a wopping 10x increase (almost 15 actually) in just 2 years. $2.57/$22.75 = ~11%, which means investors that bought in on the AI hype are already seeing the net income of their shares exceed the growth rate of the money supply (M2), which is about 7-8%. Meaning that NVDA isn’t just earning more dollars, its earning a greater share of the economic pie, and in a world where profits are actually returned to investors, would mean beating inflation (at least from a micro perspective). Now whether this cash that NVDA is reporting to generate will ever actually make it back to the shareholder is another story. Now that we’ve seen that buying (even when the fundamental value of the shares was at its lowest) has paid off, let’s take a look at how much money NVDA actually has: https://imgur.com/VSPPMhj https://imgur.com/6KPxWte As you can see, NVDA has almost no money relative to its price. The market’s pricing of NVDA is derived principally from the money it is supposed to make in the future, rather than the present value of the company. This is not what the firm would deem a good fundamental investment. Why? Because one would be paying a future price for future value, rather than the current price for its current value. Furthermore, the market is a game of desperation, and if shareholders are desperate for money, they should be offering their shares below the liquidation value of the company. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush after all. However, if one understands that NVDA’s price has been based on the growth of its earnings, and if one can also see that the growth of said earnings has gone up, but its stock price has gone down (as is the case for NVDA at the time of this post ~$135) then one could speculate that the market will not only price NVDA’s earnings higher than they are currently being priced, but that the market will actually price its earnings higher than in the previous quarters unless the market believes that NVDA’s future growth will be lower. The firm believes that within the next 3 months, NVDA will almost certainly attain new all time highs. In fact, we believe the passive participant in the market, will be genuinely surprised by how high the price of NVDA will go. At the time of this post, the firm has no positions in NVDA. An associate of the firm has exposure to NVDA through long options on the SNP500. A position the firm feels is not worth mentioning as longing the SNP500 might as well be a long on inflation. So NVDA has made all this money? How much of that money has been returned to shareholders? https://imgur.com/RANJVwo As you can see by that line at the bottom, almost none. About half of the money has been spent on share buybacks and when the company’s evaluation is 50x the money that it makes and 50x the money that it has, these buybacks only break even once the company has actually grown 50x (less so if you’re only evaluating the company on past earnings and not the amount of money it actually has, in this case, you might only want a 5x to consider yourself breaking even) . I’d much rather have my money now and use it to make more money, than wait around for NVDA to 50x. But NVDA doesnt give shareholders the option of how to spend their own money or how to evaluate the company. They don’t give the money to the shareholder to decide whether they want to wait for a 50x gain on NVDA. They’ve decided they’ll spend it for you. Not on growing the company or acquiring others, but by buying their own stock. Now that we can understand a basic view of NVDA’s finances and how it relates to its price, let’s take a glance at some of the more sinister aspects of NVDA. First is this little tidbit the firm discovered while reading NVDA’s Q2 filing: https://imgur.com/b438cbJ NVDA expects you to follow ALL 6 of its listed social media accounts and will be leaving out material information in its 10Q and 10k filings that will only be available in its listed social media accounts. This is clearly unethical, and our firm at this time questions whether this intent to distribute exclusive material information across 6 different channels is even legal. Though we do not have the legal training or background to make a claim one way or the other, we would like to assume that the system in place would not allow such a thing. Now lets throw a bone to the hardware guys. If you’ve never heard of Moore’s Law, you can skip this section as trying to understand what Moore’s Law means will get in the way of seeing the blatant contradiction between NVDA’s CEO and his company’s own SEC filings. For your time: Moore's Law is the observation that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles about every two years. The observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel From Wikipedia: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law So why is the firm bringing up Moore’s Law? We don’t even know what half that sentence means, and we certainly wouldnt be able to explain the nuances of NVDA’s hardware products. Well, there’s one thing we do know, it’s how to bullshit. So let’s wind back the clocks to the end of 2022. September. Right before entering Q4. “Moore’s Law’s dead,” Huang said, “And the ability for Moore’s Law to deliver twice the performance at the same cost, or at the same performance, half the cost, every year and a half, is over. It’s completely over, and so the idea that a chip is going to go down in cost over time, unfortunately, is a story of the past.” Source: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/moores-laws-dead-nvidia-ceo-jensen-says-in-justifying-gaming-card-price-hike-11663798618 Ok, so going into Q4, Moore’s Law is dead. The CEO said it’s over baby. Rapid growth is a thing of the past. That means the market should be lowering its growth expectations for NVDA right? https://imgur.com/VSPPMhj https://imgur.com/6KPxWte But it did the opposite. Investors were willing to pay more for less, implying they actually expected NVDA’s long term growth rate to increase not decrease. Almost as if the market knew what NVDA would end up publishing in its Q4 filing: Source: https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001045810/000104581023000017/nvda-20230129.htm (10k filed Feb 24, 2023) So not only did the company contradict the CEO’s statements made in the September prior to the reported quarter, now theyre actually ahead of Moore’s law, and according to them, giving the entire industry a path forward. What the fuck. 🤣 And to finish things off, we’ll put on our tin foil hats. The firm does not know how to verify the veracity of the following information. There has been a short report put out by Hindenburg Research regarding SMCI: https://hindenburgresearch.com/smci/ The firm has no idea if the information reported is true. So this last section is just for fun. If the information in the report is true, then the firm would conclude that it paints the picture that SMCI has been funneling money out of the company into other companies, out of shareholder hands, into the hands of insiders and their network of family and friends. SMCI’s biggest customer? NVDA. In other words, if the allegations are accurate, the biggest chunk of money that SMCI funneled out came from NVDA. So it’s really not outside the realm of possibility that NVDA was intentionally buying from SMCI knowing where the money was ending up. The firm is not in the practice of lawsuits or building criminal cases. So the firm cannot and has no intention of doing so here for you now. The firm, however, is also not stupid. And the fact that all this money the company is making is not ending up in shareholders pockets, really isnt helping the “management would never steal from shareholders” fantasy that many would like to be the truism that must be disproved with mountains of evidence. It should have to be proven that the money is being returned to investors, not the other way around. When the vast majority of the profits dont go to the investors, which we can see from the dividend chart, but get spent on buybacks at 50x multiples, well people start to listen when accusations start to be made about money being funneled into other companies. We’ve learned a lot. We’ve seen the impressive growth of NVDA’s earnings and how they relate to its price and the general hype around AI. We’ve shown that the company has barely any money at all and is being priced on future earnings. We’ve shown where some of this money is going. And we even got to put on our conspiracy hats for a little bit. And that is our fundamental analysis of NVDA, the AI giant. The good, the bad, and the fugly.

About half of the money has been spent on share buybacks and when the company’s evaluation is 50x the money that it makes and 50x the money that it has, these buybacks only break even once the company has actually grown 50x (less so if you’re only evaluating the company on past earnings and not the amount of money it actually has, in this case, you might only want a 5x to consider yourself breaking even) . I’d much rather have my money now and use it to make more money, than wait around for NVDA to 50x. But NVDA doesnt give shareholders the option of how to spend their own money or how to evaluate the company. They don’t give the money to the shareholder to decide whether they want to wait for a 50x gain on NVDA. They’ve decided they’ll spend it for you. Not on growing the company or acquiring others, but by buying their own stock.

,"There is no shortage of dollars or bullshit when it comes to NVDA, the world's AI GPU hero of heroes. And with NVDA's revenue and profits not just increasing but multiplying in such a short timespan, investors want to know is it still a good time to buy, to catch the AI wave, as it builds and crashes upon the world, both that of capital investment and the greater world at large. Revenue and profits multiplying: https://imgur.com/oOetNo4 https://imgur.com/caOkRlh And here’s the chart that shows the impact of ChatGPT on the share price and earnings: https://imgur.com/SxhIF9z The top line is the price investors are paying. The bottom line is what those investors are getting, so to speak (NVDA’s net income over the previous year (trailing twelve months)) The vertical line roughly represents ChatGPT hitting 100m users with the line at 2023 January 1st and ChatGPT reportedely hitting 100m users sometime in that month of January according to Reuters and The Guardian. Reuters: https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/ The Guardian: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/02/chatgpt-100-million-users-open-ai-fastest-growing-app The firm will present you with the basic facts about NVDA, not as, and never as, a financial recommendation, but as an introduction to its financials, to give you a better idea if it's even worth your time to further explore NVDA as a company and potential vehicle of investment. The firm does not want you to be falsely misled into thinking we can offer you expertise on NVDA, we cannot. We can however answer the questions that we would expect any man who'd risk his capital to answer. How much money does NVDA make? How much do they have? And you would think, most importantly, how much has NVDA paid their previous investors so far? And while we don't believe the answers to these questions to justify investment, this firm adamantly believes that not knowing the answers to these questions is unacceptable for those who do or would choose to buy common stock in NVDA. In short, you'd have to be a fucking idiot to lend your money to a company without reading our charts and commentary, or the equivalent there of. To assess the full risk of NVDA however, will require a much deeper dive than a single blog post can provide. Let’s take a look at what investors were thinking during the ChatGPT hype and whether that investment panned out at a fundamental rather than speculative level. In other words, did NVDA actually make more money or did its share price just go up? https://imgur.com/wRnNWlD This graph shows what percentage of NVDA’s share price was being represented by the money it had made (ttm net income/shares/share price). This 10 year low during 2023, shows unequivically that there was in fact investment hype during this time, that the price per earnings went very high as people were willing to accept less than 1% earnings just to get in on the hype. Why would investors accept such low earnings per dollar? Because these investors anticipated that the rapid adoption of ChatGPT and the AI hype around it, would mean a growth for NVDA that would more than make up for the price they paid. So were they dumb? Did they overpay? Let’s find out! For our example, we’ll imagine an investor that bought sometime in February after the 100m user threshold was announced: February 15th, 2023 $22.75 price $0.175 net income $0.175/$22.75 = ~0.8% December 10th, 2024 ~$2.57 net income $2.57/$22.17 = ~11% If an investor had bought sometime in February after the news of the 100m users was released. Let’s say for example February 15th at a closing price of approximately $22.75 per share they would have bought when NVDA’s trailing twelve month net income was about $0.175 (17.5 cents) per share, or about 0.8% of the price of the share at that time. Today, those same shares carry about $2.57 per share, a wopping 10x increase (almost 15 actually) in just 2 years. $2.57/$22.75 = ~11%, which means investors that bought in on the AI hype are already seeing the net income of their shares exceed the growth rate of the money supply (M2), which is about 7-8%. Meaning that NVDA isn’t just earning more dollars, its earning a greater share of the economic pie, and in a world where profits are actually returned to investors, would mean beating inflation (at least from a micro perspective). Now whether this cash that NVDA is reporting to generate will ever actually make it back to the shareholder is another story. Now that we’ve seen that buying (even when the fundamental value of the shares was at its lowest) has paid off, let’s take a look at how much money NVDA actually has: https://imgur.com/VSPPMhj https://imgur.com/6KPxWte As you can see, NVDA has almost no money relative to its price. The market’s pricing of NVDA is derived principally from the money it is supposed to make in the future, rather than the present value of the company. This is not what the firm would deem a good fundamental investment. Why? Because one would be paying a future price for future value, rather than the current price for its current value. Furthermore, the market is a game of desperation, and if shareholders are desperate for money, they should be offering their shares below the liquidation value of the company. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush after all. However, if one understands that NVDA’s price has been based on the growth of its earnings, and if one can also see that the growth of said earnings has gone up, but its stock price has gone down (as is the case for NVDA at the time of this post ~$135) then one could speculate that the market will not only price NVDA’s earnings higher than they are currently being priced, but that the market will actually price its earnings higher than in the previous quarters unless the market believes that NVDA’s future growth will be lower. The firm believes that within the next 3 months, NVDA will almost certainly attain new all time highs. In fact, we believe the passive participant in the market, will be genuinely surprised by how high the price of NVDA will go. At the time of this post, the firm has no positions in NVDA. An associate of the firm has exposure to NVDA through long options on the SNP500. A position the firm feels is not worth mentioning as longing the SNP500 might as well be a long on inflation. So NVDA has made all this money? How much of that money has been returned to shareholders? https://imgur.com/RANJVwo As you can see by that line at the bottom, almost none.

And with NVDA's revenue and profits not just increasing but multiplying in such a short timespan, investors want to know is it still a good time to buy, to catch the AI wave, as it builds and crashes upon the world, both that of capital investment and the greater world at large. Revenue and profits multiplying: https://imgur.com/oOetNo4 https://imgur.com/caOkRlh And here’s the chart that shows the impact of ChatGPT on the share price and earnings: https://imgur.com/SxhIF9z The top line is the price investors are paying. The bottom line is what those investors are getting, so to speak (NVDA’s net income over the previous year (trailing twelve months)) The vertical line roughly represents ChatGPT hitting 100m users with the line at 2023 January 1st and ChatGPT reportedely hitting 100m users sometime in that month of January according to Reuters and The Guardian. Reuters: https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/ The Guardian: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/02/chatgpt-100-million-users-open-ai-fastest-growing-app The firm will present you with the basic facts about NVDA, not as, and never as, a financial recommendation, but as an introduction to its financials, to give you a better idea if it's even worth your time to further explore NVDA as a company and potential vehicle of investment. The firm does not want you to be falsely misled into thinking we can offer you expertise on NVDA, we cannot. We can however answer the questions that we would expect any man who'd risk his capital to answer. How much money does NVDA make? How much do they have? And you would think, most importantly, how much has NVDA paid their previous investors so far? And while we don't believe the answers to these questions to justify investment, this firm adamantly believes that not knowing the answers to these questions is unacceptable for those who do or would choose to buy common stock in NVDA. In short, you'd have to be a fucking idiot to lend your money to a company without reading our charts and commentary, or the equivalent there of. To assess the full risk of NVDA however, will require a much deeper dive than a single blog post can provide. Let’s take a look at what investors were thinking during the ChatGPT hype and whether that investment panned out at a fundamental rather than speculative level. In other words, did NVDA actually make more money or did its share price just go up? https://imgur.com/wRnNWlD This graph shows what percentage of NVDA’s share price was being represented by the money it had made (ttm net income/shares/share price). This 10 year low during 2023, shows unequivically that there was in fact investment hype during this time, that the price per earnings went very high as people were willing to accept less than 1% earnings just to get in on the hype. Why would investors accept such low earnings per dollar? Because these investors anticipated that the rapid adoption of ChatGPT and the AI hype around it, would mean a growth for NVDA that would more than make up for the price they paid. So were they dumb? Did they overpay? Let’s find out! For our example, we’ll imagine an investor that bought sometime in February after the 100m user threshold was announced: February 15th, 2023 $22.75 price $0.175 net income $0.175/$22.75 = ~0.8% December 10th, 2024 ~$2.57 net income $2.57/$22.17 = ~11% If an investor had bought sometime in February after the news of the 100m users was released. Let’s say for example February 15th at a closing price of approximately $22.75 per share they would have bought when NVDA’s trailing twelve month net income was about $0.175 (17.5 cents) per share, or about 0.8% of the price of the share at that time. Today, those same shares carry about $2.57 per share, a wopping 10x increase (almost 15 actually) in just 2 years. $2.57/$22.75 = ~11%, which means investors that bought in on the AI hype are already seeing the net income of their shares exceed the growth rate of the money supply (M2), which is about 7-8%. Meaning that NVDA isn’t just earning more dollars, its earning a greater share of the economic pie, and in a world where profits are actually returned to investors, would mean beating inflation (at least from a micro perspective). Now whether this cash that NVDA is reporting to generate will ever actually make it back to the shareholder is another story. Now that we’ve seen that buying (even when the fundamental value of the shares was at its lowest) has paid off, let’s take a look at how much money NVDA actually has: https://imgur.com/VSPPMhj https://imgur.com/6KPxWte As you can see, NVDA has almost no money relative to its price. The market’s pricing of NVDA is derived principally from the money it is supposed to make in the future, rather than the present value of the company. This is not what the firm would deem a good fundamental investment. Why? Because one would be paying a future price for future value, rather than the current price for its current value. Furthermore, the market is a game of desperation, and if shareholders are desperate for money, they should be offering their shares below the liquidation value of the company. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush after all. However, if one understands that NVDA’s price has been based on the growth of its earnings, and if one can also see that the growth of said earnings has gone up, but its stock price has gone down (as is the case for NVDA at the time of this post ~$135) then one could speculate that the market will not only price NVDA’s earnings higher than they are currently being priced, but that the market will actually price its earnings higher than in the previous quarters unless the market believes that NVDA’s future growth will be lower. The firm believes that within the next 3 months, NVDA will almost certainly attain new all time highs. In fact, we believe the passive participant in the market, will be genuinely surprised by how high the price of NVDA will go. At the time of this post, the firm has no positions in NVDA. An associate of the firm has exposure to NVDA through long options on the SNP500. A position the firm feels is not worth mentioning as longing the SNP500 might as well be a long on inflation. So NVDA has made all this money? How much of that money has been returned to shareholders? https://imgur.com/RANJVwo As you can see by that line at the bottom, almost none. About half of the money has been spent on share buybacks and when the company’s evaluation is 50x the money that it makes and 50x the money that it has, these buybacks only break even once the company has actually grown 50x (less so if you’re only evaluating the company on past earnings and not the amount of money it actually has, in this case, you might only want a 5x to consider yourself breaking even) . I’d much rather have my money now and use it to make more money, than wait around for NVDA to 50x. But NVDA doesnt give shareholders the option of how to spend their own money or how to evaluate the company. They don’t give the money to the shareholder to decide whether they want to wait for a 50x gain on NVDA. They’ve decided they’ll spend it for you. Not on growing the company or acquiring others, but by buying their own stock. Now that we can understand a basic view of NVDA’s finances and how it relates to its price, let’s take a glance at some of the more sinister aspects of NVDA. First is this little tidbit the firm discovered while reading NVDA’s Q2 filing: https://imgur.com/b438cbJ NVDA expects you to follow ALL 6 of its listed social media accounts and will be leaving out material information in its 10Q and 10k filings that will only be available in its listed social media accounts. This is clearly unethical, and our firm at this time questions whether this intent to distribute exclusive material information across 6 different channels is even legal. Though we do not have the legal training or background to make a claim one way or the other, we would like to assume that the system in place would not allow such a thing. Now lets throw a bone to the hardware guys. If you’ve never heard of Moore’s Law, you can skip this section as trying to understand what Moore’s Law means will get in the way of seeing the blatant contradiction between NVDA’s CEO and his company’s own SEC filings. For your time: Moore's Law is the observation that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles about every two years. The observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel From Wikipedia: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law So why is the firm bringing up Moore’s Law? We don’t even know what half that sentence means, and we certainly wouldnt be able to explain the nuances of NVDA’s hardware products. Well, there’s one thing we do know, it’s how to bullshit. So let’s wind back the clocks to the end of 2022. September. Right before entering Q4. “Moore’s Law’s dead,” Huang said, “And the ability for Moore’s Law to deliver twice the performance at the same cost, or at the same performance, half the cost, every year and a half, is over. It’s completely over, and so the idea that a chip is going to go down in cost over time, unfortunately, is a story of the past.” Source: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/moores-laws-dead-nvidia-ceo-jensen-says-in-justifying-gaming-card-price-hike-11663798618 Ok, so going into Q4, Moore’s Law is dead. The CEO said it’s over baby. Rapid growth is a thing of the past. That means the market should be lowering its growth expectations for NVDA right? https://imgur.com/VSPPMhj https://imgur.com/6KPxWte But it did the opposite. Investors were willing to pay more for less, implying they actually expected NVDA’s long term growth rate to increase not decrease. Almost as if the market knew what NVDA would end up publishing in its Q4 filing: Source: https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001045810/000104581023000017/nvda-20230129.htm (10k filed Feb 24, 2023) So not only did the company contradict the CEO’s statements made in the September prior to the reported quarter, now theyre actually ahead of Moore’s law, and according to them, giving the entire industry a path forward. What the fuck. 🤣 And to finish things off, we’ll put on our tin foil hats. The firm does not know how to verify the veracity of the following information. There has been a short report put out by Hindenburg Research regarding SMCI: https://hindenburgresearch.com/smci/ The firm has no idea if the information reported is true. So this last section is just for fun. If the information in the report is true, then the firm would conclude that it paints the picture that SMCI has been funneling money out of the company into other companies, out of shareholder hands, into the hands of insiders and their network of family and friends. SMCI’s biggest customer? NVDA. In other words, if the allegations are accurate, the biggest chunk of money that SMCI funneled out came from NVDA. So it’s really not outside the realm of possibility that NVDA was intentionally buying from SMCI knowing where the money was ending up. The firm is not in the practice of lawsuits or building criminal cases. So the firm cannot and has no intention of doing so here for you now. The firm, however, is also not stupid. And the fact that all this money the company is making is not ending up in shareholders pockets, really isnt helping the “management would never steal from shareholders” fantasy that many would like to be the truism that must be disproved with mountains of evidence. It should have to be proven that the money is being returned to investors, not the other way around. When the vast majority of the profits dont go to the investors, which we can see from the dividend chart, but get spent on buybacks at 50x multiples, well people start to listen when accusations start to be made about money being funneled into other companies. We’ve learned a lot. We’ve seen the impressive growth of NVDA’s earnings and how they relate to its price and the general hype around AI. We’ve shown that the company has barely any money at all and is being priced on future earnings. We’ve shown where some of this money is going. And we even got to put on our conspiracy hats for a little bit. And that is our fundamental analysis of NVDA, the AI giant. The good, the bad, and the fugly. Thanks for tuning in.",i didn’t add and nvda is still a great stable play. Don’t plan to sell for another $50 gain,0,0.517,NEGATIVE,0.994
