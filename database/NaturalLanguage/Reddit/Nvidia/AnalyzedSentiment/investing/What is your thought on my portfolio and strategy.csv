,"I'm 30M. I recently started investing in ETF & individual stocks. Below is my portfolio I figured it out myself, but I am not sure if it is reasonable in the long run, and I want to hear other people's opinions, comments, and criticism on it. I put in a lump sum (a large amount of my saving money after I excluded emergency money) and plan to DCA monthly. ETF 75% - iShares Core MSCI World (Acc) - IWDA Individual stocks 25% - Tech Growth 12%: Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, Palantir, Nvidia, Tesla - (High-)dividend 5%: Siemens, Merck & Co, Swiss Re, Exxon Mobil, McDonald - Consumer defensive 3%: UnitedHealth, Mastercard, Cola - Personal favorite 3.5%: Garmin, Air Product and Chemicals, Walmart, Rolls-Royce, Airbus - Aerospace & Defensive 1.5%: Rocket Lab, Howmet, RTX Corp The reason that my portfolio contains more than 20 stocks is that I want to diversify it in terms of the stocks, not types of assets. My concerns/questions are: I'm not sure if I hold too many stocks in the same category (e.g. tech stocks) and most of them are already covered by the IWDA ETF. I'm also considering holding only 1 or 2 high-dividend stocks like AbbVie, instead of 5 dividend stocks. Is it a good idea? My long-term plan follows ""time in the market > timing the market"". So I plan to split DCA in half and put in ETF and stocks equally. I also read about the Enhanced DCA. Statistically, is the Enhanced DCA worth a try? All suggestions are welcome. I'm happy to give more information and appreciate any help you can provide. :)","Honestly depends on how much you know about each company. Knowing those companies inside and out is arguably more valuable than not fully understanding a diversified single stock portfolio. I tend to do 40% in VOO, 10% in FTEC, 10% in FDIS, 5-10% in both Small and Mid-Cap ETFs (VOT and VB) and then everything else is technology because I know that the inside and out. I scrapped dividend stocks because I’m not sure where I’ll be able to write off long-term investment gains down the road in life (I’m 29) and don’t want to pay taxes on those dividends now. With that being said, a set of corporate bonds may be wise to make things more conservative (SPHY).",0,0.554,0.995,NEGATIVE

Less reward, but unless you spend day and night researching the individual stocks, you likely won’t beat the ETF.",2,0.511,0.982,POSITIVE
