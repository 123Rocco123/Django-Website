Apple and Microsoft are the two biggest holdings in the fund, at roughly 22% each. Nvidia makes up less than 6% despite being only slightly behind the two leaders in market cap. Projections from a June 12 UBS note suggested that, if Nvidia climbs to second and bumps Apple to third, it could result in the chipmaker’s weight in the fund vaulting to 21%, while Apple would be slimmed down to just 4.5%. A 15 percentage point swing in Nvidia’s weight would mean that the fund would need to acquire more than $10 billion worth of shares in the chipmaker — all on or very close to June 21, the rebalance date.https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/14/fridays-trading-could-trigger-a-10-billion-rush-of-demand-for-nvidia-shares-heres-how.html",0,0.533,NEGATIVE,0.999
