,"If you had to start again today and could only choose five stocks to set you up for the rest of your life, what would they be? Imagine you can't do any day trading or chopping and changing. Just five stocks to set you up for the long term. The tech and AI ones are obvious, particularly stuff like Amazon, NVIDIA, Microsoft etc. I struggle to think of what would be in my guaranteed top five though.",I’d simply restart again and go 100% VT. There is no reality where you have to choose only 5 stocks. Silly proposition and a waste of time to even think about.,0,0.518,NEGATIVE,1.0

With five stocks the potential outcomes are far too variable. If I had to, I’d play it safe, pick established companies like Coca-Cola that I can be fairly certain will still exist in 30 years.Emerging trends are risky. One of the big lessons from the dot-com bubble is that we can be right about a trend (the Internet is going to change how we live and work) but still very wrong about which companies survive to profit from it.",0,0.526,NEGATIVE,1.0

Probably proctor and gamble, JP Morgan and maybe Pepsi.That’s just off the top of my head though. I’m sure I’d tweak the last 3 if I put some serious time and thought into it.

Here’s mine:• HESAY (Hermès): Known for its luxury goods like Birkin and Kelly bags, Hermès has a strong brand and consistent revenue growth, making it a solid long-term investment.• MELI (MercadoLibre, Inc.): As the leading e-commerce platform in Latin America, MercadoLibre benefits from the region’s growing internet penetration and e-commerce adoption.• IDXX (IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.): Specializing in veterinary diagnostics, IDEXX is positioned well in the growing pet care industry with innovative products and services.• MSCI (MSCI Inc.): A leader in global indices and analytics, MSCI benefits from increasing demand for data-driven investment strategies.• MA (Mastercard Incorporated): With its extensive global payment network, Mastercard is poised to capitalize on the shift towards digital payments",0,0.534,POSITIVE,1.0

I bought after it's crash and near bankruptcy. I bought at 7 dollars and 10 dollars a share and then it dropped to 4 dollars, I held and then when the price reached 16 dollars a share I sold because I was scared of its volatility.... it's now at 251$ a share..",0,0.542,POSITIVE,0.856
