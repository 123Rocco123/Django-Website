Had to sell a bunch for a remodel a few years back and kept a portion of every stock I had instead of dumping a single ticker. Have I missed gains? Of course but I still have gains and fomo is reduced a bit.Another idea is if OP has 100+ shares is to sell call options at prices against the shares. For instance if OP sells a 525c with Oct 6 expiration for $11 then OP sells the shares actually at $536 if NVDA goes above $525. If it doesn’t hit that mark OP collects $1100. Could even more it higher to something like $600 January 24 exp. Would collect $2000 or sell at $620. Compared to selling today it reduces a bit of FOMO but at le",1,0.518,0.948,NEGATIVE

Like Nvidia, Cisco is a profitable, well-managed and important company.third, Nvidia has an insane valuation. there are different ways to estimate the 'fair value' of a stock. if a stock is trading at $100, that could be a reasonable 'fair price' -- or it could be overpriced, or might be underpriced. it's a bit like looking at Kelly Blue Book to estimate if a used car's price is reasonable. imagine a given car is worth maybe $12,000 to $15,000. you might pay $17,000 if it's in excellent condition with low miles, or you might offer $10k for one in worse shape. but you're not gonna pay $50k or $2k for that car. Nvidia has a 'price to earnings ratio' of 113, which is considered very high for this type of stock. you're paying $113 in stock price for every $1 in company earnings. the average price to earnings for their type of company is closer to ~25 ... as a general rule, you want to avoid higher price to earnings stocks for long-term investments. in the book The Future for Investors, professor Jeremy Siegel writes how stocks that trade above about a price to earnings ratio of 50 or so, for long periods, usually have very disappointing long-term results. the average price to earnings for Nvidia over the last 5 years is 73. https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/nvda/valuation",0,0.558,1.0,NEGATIVE

Depending on how much you need that money, take some profit and sell some of the Nvidia shares.IF you don't and you're saving enough for your other needs (emergency savings, retirement, etc.) then Nvidia can be your speculative play. I would hate to buy more of it now but that's not what you're doing. You could play with the momentum and sentiment and see if it jumps a bit more. There's a lot that is compelling to the underlying Nvidia story.That said yields generally predict future returns. For me personally, I would take some profit as I think a P/E of 100 -200 something is pretty incredible and can be blown up by a bad quarter or some bad news. That said I think there's enough there that I would be willing to gamble a little longer though I would have a limit sell or something at 10%.",0,0.546,0.507,NEGATIVE

Still, it seems your risk aversion towards this particular stock is a bit high and usually when you’re wondering if it’s getting too high, it’s your own brain telling you that it’s time to cut back on the downside risk that your current position in Nvidia has.You could reap some profits and allocate it somewhere less risky like an index ETF. That way you will mitigate any potential losses your great pick could have and also give you capital to continue to stock pick when the time arrives and if you wish to do so again.Getting these picks is 50% luck but also 50% prudence. You can’t stock pick if you get wiped out due to fear of missing out on even more gains. Investing is a balancing act of letting your winners run and saving up to fight another day.

,"Hi all. At the end of last year, and earlier this year. I made a few investments in Nvidia. By pure chance it was around the time of the rocky launch of the 40 series cards and before the AI boom. I am currently 149% up on my investment. My question is, should I sit on this and continue to invest? Or would it be better to take out the profits and reinvest, either back into Nvidia if their sticks dip or in so thing else. I have not invested in them recently as their stock is high and it seems I would make much on the investment, is this also the correct thing to do? I’m new to all this and just pretty much randomly made a lucky investment. Thanks I’m advice for any advice.","Nvidia is valued pretty damn high for whag they're worth. No guarantee, but not a bad idea to pull out. BUT also there's no real evidence they're gonna crash yet either. Maybe observe the weather and see how you go.",0,0.525,0.998,POSITIVE
