,"I want to invest ~$10,000 in Tesla and maybe $2,000 in Nvidia. I don’t know anything about investing but I want to start. What’s the best brokerage to use? Should I use Robinhood instead? My father has gold for his crypto so I might have him hold it in his account. I want to use Charles Schwab because there are so many of them where I live. Also, I only hear good things about them. What about Fidelity? I hear a lot about them but I also hear complaints of it being too saturated, thus customer service is a bust. Is there any brokerage company that also offers financial advisors as a free service? I know Schwab does, but only if the account is worth $500,000. Thank you! Edit: My mom wants me to invest it for her, but under my name. She has $200,000 in savings and want to invest because she’s seeing Tesla going up for the next 3 years.",Don’t do this,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,1.0

Do the same thing every year till retirement. You will look back and thank yourself.If you don't have an emergency fund of 3-6 months expenses, open a HYSA for the rest. If that's already in place, then open a taxable account and you can play with individual tickers. I reco against it till you learn more but go for it.If you still want to invest in TSLA and NVDA then open a small position in each and DCA into them as you wish but don't make them a large percentage of your portfolio till you learn more about investing.Just my $0.02 - not professional financial advice.",0,0.521,NEGATIVE,0.999

No, don't buy just two stocks. Open a brokerage account and start to learn about investing. Schwab charges no fee to buy or sell stocks so start with trading $100 or $200 worth until you know what you are doing.",0,0.545,NEGATIVE,0.538

If you’re new to this and either stock drops you’ll most likely have a bad experience and could risk panic selling.Any of those brokerages are fine. They’re like a grocery store, any grocery sells food (stocks) so you have to go with whichever makes you feel comfortable. If you want to develop an in person relationship I’d go Schwab route, but beware of fee based advising, it can take a huge chunk of your gains.There are mountains of information free online, as well many good options at the library. I’d recommend doing some research before you drop your whole nest egg.",0,0.527,NEGATIVE,0.999

I would put 7000$ straight in Roth IRA and January first out your remaining 5k. Keep it simple and boring and you don’t need a advisor",0,0.511,NEGATIVE,1.0

I have made many good stock picks then lost all my gains and more hoping the stock will go even higher and not not setting a stop to protect my gain. There are investing simulators where you can try strategies and not lose real money. I use Schwab.,0,0.548,POSITIVE,0.985
