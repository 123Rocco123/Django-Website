And more importantly, would you like to talk about the optimal frequency and strategy for DCA investing?","The purpose of the DCA strategy is to remove timing considerations altogether. NVDA is down relative to where it was a month ago. A month from now, it might be even lower (so you've ""lost"" money that you invest now) or higher. It's impossible to know for certain. So if you subscribe to the DCA philosophy, then you say that you're investing $x/period in defined investments no matter what the market conditions.So is right now a good time to start your DCA strategy? If you agree with the philosophy, then the answer is basically always yes (except if you have other savings goals, then maybe). If you don't, then it's important to determine your preferred investment strategy.",0,0.525,NEGATIVE,0.997

As frequently discussed in this sub, lump sum beats DCA historically by a comfortable margin. Meaning, if you truly acknowledge you cannot time the market and know nothing about its short term future movements, the default position ought to be lump sum (the on-average clear winner). Choosing DCA instead is choosing (whether consciously or unconsciously) to make a bet that you think the market will drop at some point in the next 6/12 months (or whatever your DCA period): lump-sum is better on average, but you're choosing the worse-on-average approach either 'in case of' a downturn or because you consciously believe there will be one.",1,0.525,NEGATIVE,0.579

By that logic all investing is DCA, unless you literally invest a single time in your life and never again.When one is comparing lump sum to DCA (what is being done in this thread) one is comparing ""I have a lump sum of money and invest it all right now"" vs. ""I have a lump sum of money and invest it over time"". An employee regularly receiving paychecks and investing a portion of each one does not have a singular chunk of money that they are voluntarily choosing to spread out over time: they are receiving a series of chunks of money over time and investing from each one immediately.Call it ""forced DCA"" or whatever if you like, but it is not comparable to the DCA vs. lump-sum discussion we're having (in which lump sum investing a sum overperforms DCA'ing that sum historically), as the person investing a portion of paycheck #1 literally cannot yet invest the money they'll receive from checks 2-26 in a year, as they don't have that future money yet.",5,0.522,NEGATIVE,1.0

I always recommend r/personalfinance's Prime Directive as a starting point. If you can get on a path towards automating maxing out your 401k and Roth/IRA, then you're doing well. Just make sure you invest it.For example, you can open a Vanguard Roth IRA. Vanguard allows you to automatically invest in the Roth IRA. This year, the maximum you can invest in a Roth IRA is $7000 (assuming you're too young to do catch-up investments). So you could set it up to invest $269.23 every biweekly paycheck, or $583.33 every month, in a low-cost index fund like VTSAX or an ETF like VOO. Set it and forget it, and by the time you retire, you should be set up nicely. Also, make sure you contribute to max out your employer match in your 401k first - that's free money.Part of the premise of DCA is that it doesn't matter what period you choose - daily, weekly, monthly, etc. What matters is that you do it, and do it consistently.",2,0.524,POSITIVE,0.983

The bigger your portfolio gets, the more it is dominated by market returns and the less impact your contributions have on wealth and internal rate of return. For most people making regular contributions to an account, the timing of contributions only has a significant influence in the first 10 years or so of investing. Beyond these first 10 years, market returns begin to overwhelm the influence of your contributions unless you have some large windfall or make a significant increase in the size of contributions.",0,0.533,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"When stocks plummet it feels like you can start doing DCA to prevent emotional investing. I'm more concerned about chip stocks, September got off to a rough start for chip stocks, with $NVIDIA (NVDA.US)$ tumbling nearly 10%, the $PHLX Semiconductor Index (.SOX.US)$ slumping 8%, and shares of $Micron Technology (MU.US)$ and $Intel (INTC.US)$ declining by more than 5%, etc. But I didn't have a DCA investment plan before, investing in ETFs containing shares of these stocks looks safer...ETF recommendation? And more importantly, would you like to talk about the optimal frequency and strategy for DCA investing?","It's often said that DCA works best when you're not sure where the market is headed. Given the current uncertainties, it could be a good approach. Just make sure to balance your investments with other strategies and stay informed about market conditions.",0,0.567,NEGATIVE,0.855
