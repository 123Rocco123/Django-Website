Any recommendations?","I‚Äôll give you two to do DD on.QUAD. $8.64/share. Should earn $1.20/share in 2025. Huge free cash flow and EBITDA. Done paying debt to manageable levels and will focus more on returning to shareholders with higher dividend and buybacks in 2025. Current dividend $0.20/share. If the market revalues them to 5x EV/EBITDA, should be about $20/share at end of 2025.IAG. $5.35/share. Just opened 3rd largest gold mine in Canada earlier in 2024. Capex needs going forward will be substantially reduced. I expect them to earn $1.30/share in 2025 with $2,700/oz gold price. EBITDA and FCF will be substantial going forward such that debt could be eliminated in 2025. I expect them to start issuing a dividend beginning in 2025. At a 12x PE, the share price will likely be $15+ by end of 2025.",0,0.54,NEGATIVE,0.842
