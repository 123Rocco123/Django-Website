However climate change is going to be a huge problem for the industry, hell it already is. We already had guidance in this year’s report that went something to the effect of “our insurance unit looks good, depending on hurricane season”.Insurance companies are going to end up on the hook much more for disasters, or they are going to have to drop giant regions (no more Florida, Texas, etc).
