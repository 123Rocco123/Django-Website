Semi production does not scale overnight, or even over months quickly. It can easily be 12+ months to actually see the products if you choose to increase scaling today. Because even if you might be able to tape out more wafers, it doesn't mean there is enough packaging capacity or other components available. They are scrambling, because companies that actually need this hardware sees the supply problems ahead and because that is the only way to get in line. It costs them less to overpay and over order hardware, than the percieved loss of possible growth (aka investors shitting on their valuation) from falling behind in the ""AI race"". Then you have other companies just joining the gold rush, making the problem even worse. The semi space does not handle demand spikes well, especially at the high end.Which means Nvidia can both charge whatever the fuck they want for what rolls off the product lines. And orders become larger and demand lasts longer, than if it was more organic growth or Nvidia just had products ready to ship. After the pandemic supply issues and prices across multiple industries, I figured more people would be able to see what is actually happening by now. The semi space in particular is just very vulnerable to these sort of events due to the timelines involved.Nvidia definitely has a product that can sell and will see good future growth. Trying to extrapolate what exactly that demand and growth is in a ""gold rush"" situation is a lot harder. Current data for sales of AI related hardware is about as useful for future potenial, as consumer GPUs in 2021 during the crypto boom for that segment.",1,0.54,1.0,NEGATIVE
