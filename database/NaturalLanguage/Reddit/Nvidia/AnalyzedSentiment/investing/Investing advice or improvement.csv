,"I am a uni student with no current income at the moment. I have £350 invested in stocks, £250 in gold and £1000 in premium bonds. My current stocks are roughly £150 in S&P 500, £50 Nvidia, £50 Coinbase, £50 in ACHR and then two riskier £25 in SMCI and Lucid. I have roughly £2k in savings as well. What should you recommend to kind of have short term gains but also not risking a lot of money?","The best investment you can make at this stage in life is in your education, skills, future earning potential, and life. Don't worry about market investing. Worry about having an emergency fund, managing your cash flow, and doing everything you can to set yourself up to have a productive and fulfilling career and life. No offense, but these investments will (hopefully) be a rounding error in your life even just a few years into the workforce. Don't spend mental energy on them when you have a million more important and impactful things to worry about.",0,0.534,POSITIVE,1.0
