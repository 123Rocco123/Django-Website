,"Hello everyone. I promise this is not a ""I have $X to invest"" post. I'm curious about the investment strategy of buying high when it's a good company. For examples, look at Microsoft, Amazon, Eli Lilly, and Nvidia. All at very high points. Hitting new all time highs even. In theory, my heart says if you truly believe in the company and that the stock will go up, then buying high isn't a problem. But my brain is just like, NO, it'll clearly go down. You never buy high lol. So what do YOU all do? Do you have a favorite stock that you buy more of no matter how high it gets? Or do you just enjoy the ride with what you have and look for something else to invest in? I do have some small positions in those four companies, which is why I'm familiar with them. Clearly I'm comfortable enough with them to hold the shares I have. But my brain is just so wired to not buy high at peaks. I've read a decent amount of different strategies and things to look for, but I've never really seen anything about a successful company and buying high. I know it could be a little subjective too. Depends on your age and risk tolerance and things like that and what you are looking for, but I guess I'm just trying to go for a more General approach in this question. But in an effort to help if people want, I'm mid 30s, married, kids on the way. Have a good job and not worry about retirement. My personal investing is to try to Simply make money for me and the family for stuff like trips and fixing the house and things like that, so risk tolerance is fairly high. TL:DR I guess you could boil this down to a simple question. ""When is it too late to jump on the train?""

There are over 200 other countries in the world besides the US. If you want a reality check go look at the history of other stock market indexes. Or better yet look at countries whose entire markets disappeared entirely. The ideological obsession with indexing and ""buy and hold forever"" is fucking stupid and its no better any other strategy. It's just as much speculation and market timing as any other investment strategy.You can make substantially more money buying 10 year treasuries, selling when rates drop, and then buying back stocks after they've tanked.

The first time is like what you are describing, ""When to Buy?"". The second time and almost more tricky is ""When to Sell?""You mention that you have a family and are in your mid-30's. I'm speculating that there is not alot of time to perform market research on the 4 companies you mention to know when to sell. And you can't just hold these stocks forever. I don't KNOW this, but I can speculate that these 4 companies will not be the top companies when you retire 30 years from now and start wanting the money.A better approach, imho, is to invest in index ETF's. Then the answer of ""When to Buy"" is easy... it's now. And the answer to ""When to Sell?"" is also easy, when you need the money. And let the index and ETF rebalancing do the work for you. As a suggestion, invest in SPLG (S&P500), but you could also try SPGP for a bit more growth (but more risk and fluctuations) or SCHD for more value (less risk, but less return as well).If you need to scratch that itch, much like I do, then invest a smaller percentage, like 5%-10%, in the companies you mention so that you can have some interest in the individual markets.",0,0.544,0.987,NEGATIVE

That's the market's consensus and that's why you cannot plan to earn money solely on your belief that it will do well, shared by just about everyone else.In other words, you should buy shares of companies that you think will do better than the general public thinks it will do (yes, even if the company will not do well, but you think it will be slightly less shitty than everyone else thinks).Currently, the market prices that the price of Nvidia is 96x the yearly earnings. Forward PE is around 35. It's legit if you believe that the earnings will outpace this.

Looking at the past performance of some older very successful companies you can see that there were years during which someone might feel that there's no point buying now and they'd be wrong. And other times there is a sudden spike that then dies out and the price remains constant ever since.There are so many factors that can play into this that there is no solid answer but as a general unofficial rule you have to think about how much of this newfound worth is true and how much is made up. NVIDIA for example who are this week's sweetheart have experienced rapid appreciation. Obviously it won't keep going forever but they are industry leaders and a well established company so just because their current peak won't last it doesn't mean they're a bad long term investment.Then you have the other side of single events that momentarily drive the price up on some companies and then they never happen again.

Or do you just enjoy the ride with what you have and look for something else to invest in?I've been investing since I was in my late teens and early twenties. About 25 years. Here's a point that I don't think is made often enough:All else being equal, if you are willing to hold onto a stock, then why wouldn't you be willing to buy more? Tax reasons to hold a stock while not buying more? Sure, that happens. Portfolio balancing strategies? Good point.However, in general, if you don't think a stock will go up from it's current levels more than what you could get in an index fund or safer investment, then why would you continue to hold what you have? Buy an index fund or stick it in a high yield savings account. Conversely, if you are willing to hold what you have, then why wouldn't you buy more?People get too caught up in cost basis, how much they've gained or lost, and the past in general. What matters is today. Every day I wake up is like I just bought all of my stocks again. It might be surprising then that I rarely hold a stock for less than a year and often hold them for many years. I've bought and added to some stock for decades. Some of them have grown no more than the overall market. HOWEVER, a big difference is that they've been more volatile than the overall market and therefore presented more opportunities to buy at lower levels. The results in a higher long term return.I'm also going to mention that your ""favorite stocks"" and ""enjoy the ride"" language make it seem as if you're a bit caught up in the emotional side of investing.",0,0.553,0.544,POSITIVE

If you are 60 and planning to retire in 5 years, the answer to your question will (likely) be different than from someone who is 25 and planning to hold for 35 years, and different again from someone wanting to invest for their 10 year old's college education.",0,0.54,1.0,NEGATIVE
,"Hello everyone. I promise this is not a ""I have $X to invest"" post. I'm curious about the investment strategy of buying high when it's a good company. For examples, look at Microsoft, Amazon, Eli Lilly, and Nvidia. All at very high points. Hitting new all time highs even. In theory, my heart says if you truly believe in the company and that the stock will go up, then buying high isn't a problem. But my brain is just like, NO, it'll clearly go down. You never buy high lol. So what do YOU all do? Do you have a favorite stock that you buy more of no matter how high it gets? Or do you just enjoy the ride with what you have and look for something else to invest in? I do have some small positions in those four companies, which is why I'm familiar with them. Clearly I'm comfortable enough with them to hold the shares I have. But my brain is just so wired to not buy high at peaks. I've read a decent amount of different strategies and things to look for, but I've never really seen anything about a successful company and buying high. I know it could be a little subjective too. Depends on your age and risk tolerance and things like that and what you are looking for, but I guess I'm just trying to go for a more General approach in this question. But in an effort to help if people want, I'm mid 30s, married, kids on the way. Have a good job and not worry about retirement. My personal investing is to try to Simply make money for me and the family for stuff like trips and fixing the house and things like that, so risk tolerance is fairly high. TL:DR I guess you could boil this down to a simple question. ""When is it too late to jump on the train?"" Thank you.","I like your approach of investing outside of retirement accounts for expenses like this. I did the same thing, starting in 98 or so. Partly as an exercise - i wanted to learn how stock investing works. Turned out I really like doing it - the research, the monitoring, the decision points (like the one you describe). I'm not concerned with whether I'm beating index funds in these accounts.I closed my AAPL position last yera after Morningstar had had them at a sell rating (2 stars) for quite a while. AMZN I still hold, is currently three stars(hold), but in recent years before the recovery we're in now they were four and five stars. I added to the position. Then on a dip, was able to sell that small tax lot at a loss, then rebuy after 30d wash sale period was over at a better basis. Good fun!We're just starting retirment - cutting back on our income earning hours and eventually to 0 probably this year for me. So a lot of my moves of late have been income oriented. I added AMT and O to the mix. Doubled down on the midstream energy MLPs we own. The whole of our equities positions (a mix of taxed and IRAs now) earn a return of about 6% at the moment, despite over 10% of it not earning dividends at all.That all said, to your question - I am in your boat. I find it hard to add at these high levels. That's probably part of why I pulled the plug on AAPL. AMZN share price is low enough I was able to dip my toe in and do that last year or two. I find some comfort knowing that the DRIPs all my index investing is in, mostly VTI and some of which is tech heavy (TTMIX) means I keep adding a bit more every dividend.",0,0.538,0.939,POSITIVE
