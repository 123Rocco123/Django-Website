,"Would like to know this communities analysis on https://themadking.com/article/nvidia-the-red-flags/. Summary: NVIDIA's GPU demand appears inflated.

CoreWeave leveraged GPUs as collateral to raise debt equal to its previous valuation, amounting to $2.3 billion. NVIDIA's Q2 earnings beat corresponds to the debt issued to CoreWeave.

Yes, their play is risky (I don't like leverage plays), but it's totally legit. There is not enough gpu's at the moment. If gpu's won't be bought by Corewaeve, Microsoft will buy them instead. So, what's the problem?IMHO is that someone is trying to manipulate the market. If nvda would go significantly down I would be buying.",0,0.547,NEGATIVE,0.948

Think about saying in the 90’s, Amazon is the best online bookstore, but why pay such a high valuation, how can an online bookstore get bigger? Amazon had a vision that no one else could see, because only Amazon had the technology and the vision. The point is, technology is going in a certain direction, and NVIDIA is a generation ahead.When I first accessed the internet, I used a dial up modem. Imagine NVIDIA being the only supplier of dial up modems. Then, imagine that NVIDIA was the only company that knew what the future of internet connectivity was-they would be designing wireless internet connections, when no one else even understood internet connectivity.My point is, I think the valuation for NVIDIA might be warranted because of their tech and vision for the future in AI. When I see their valuation, I don’t think it’s what they’re selling now;I think people see the potential for more profitability in the ongoing early days of AI. Engineering the H100 was ahead of schedule because of NVIDIA and their ability to accomplish what others couldn’t. And if they did it at the birth of AI, I think people are betting they can succeed in the early days of AI too.They are just way ahead. Skate to where the cup is going to be, not where it is. I think NVIDIA has proven they know where the future is going better than anyone else.Having said all that, I am no expert, so not preaching, just responding w my opinion.",1,0.547,NEGATIVE,0.996

The AI boom is just starting. I’ve been involved in the technical side of AI since the 1980s. This is qualitatively different than the last few AI booms. The pieces are all in place for actual true AI. That’s a much longer discussion as to why. But it will keep improving as technology advances and NVDA is going to be central to that for at least a decade. Also, NVDA isn’t just “AI”. The GPUs are the engines that will drive a whole lot of things that you don’t know about yet.

Here with NVDA, the coreweave redeployment of debt back to NVDA is recycling the same single house transaction repeatedly. In real estate we refer to this as arms length transaction. With NVDA relationship no only to coreweave but 10 other companies they have invested in that in turn for/ because of investment are required to purchase even more chips, makes this dynamic problematic. As long as the cycle circles and investors don’t catch on, the price will continue to go higher, however there will be a point when the market acknowledges that the NVDA revenue is artificially created (sorry no pun intended) and that a large portion is not “arms length” this will crater faster than the run up. For the sake of your example of housing, it would be more similar to buying a house and flipping it back to the seller so you can buy it back and flip it back to the seller again and again and again. As long as the other neighbors don’t catch on, everyone’s value will go higher, since the transaction (or NVDA case revenue) keeps going up. That all ends when the neighborhood realizes there are no new neighbors it’s just the buyer and seller all along selling the same house over and over and rinsing the transaction.",1,0.526,NEGATIVE,1.0
