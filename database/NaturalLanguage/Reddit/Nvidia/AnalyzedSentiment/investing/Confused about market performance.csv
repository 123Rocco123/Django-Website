Strong economic years make up for the lack of records during a downturn though. Seems like the market has been at an ATH every week this year.

In reality they were often broken up, renamed, bought by private equity, or merged with other companies while shareholders often were paid out handsomely.

Dell acquired EMC and out of that I got a chunk of change and Dell stock. Then Dell spun off vmware, so I had that too. Then Broadcom acquired vmware and I chose (stupidly) the payout option. Iâ€™ve had numerous companies go private.. some at a gain and some at a loss (sunrise assisted living, silver diner, Buffalo Wild Wings).

What is the general sentiment and advice for these stocks?","I could cut a piece of paper into 100 pieces and sell one piece for $1 trillionI now have a $99 trillion piece of paperStocks can work the same way sometimes, your valuation can become dramatically untethered to realityTraditionally they are supposed to be a valuation based on the future cash flows of companies so if a company makes $1 million in profits a year we add up the value of that cash flow discounted back to today's dollarThe actual stock market is a lot more volatile than that and Companies routinely trade for far more or less. If you had tried to be a valuation investor the past 15 years you would have dramatically underperformed the major indices.The thing about the past 15 years is that much of the economic profits have been greater concentrated in the core large cap growth technology stocks. These companies have been run extremely well and investors have rewarded them with greater and greater valuations.Couple that with a federal reserve that has been dramatically expanding money supply and keeping rates low has meant for a historically rosy scenario for large growth stocks",0,0.555,POSITIVE,0.994

Not savvy about investing, but that is my perception. What is the general sentiment and advice for these stocks?","Focus investing in broad market ETFs. They're set up so that they own a percentage of stock comparable to the companies market cap. Example: If NVDIA makes up 10% of the S&P market cap, then an ETF fixed to the S&P (like VOO or SPY) will have 10% of their portfolio dedicated to NVDA stock. If the market share shifts in the future, so do the holding percentages of the ETF. It's like dynamic investing. The ETF will do all the buying and selling of individual stocks for you, take a small fee (Vanguard offerings are usually less than 0.1%) and return capital to you quarterly, while maintaining equity growth, provided you don't sell your stake.I like VT and VONG. At a 45%/45% split. The remaining 10% is in my ""Bonds and Bets"" category. Crypto, Semi-Conductors, a speculative Helium play, and of course bonds.VT = vanguard total world fund. If a company exists on this planet, this fund owns stock in it (I'm sure there is some nuance). The amount of shares owned, again, depends on the market cap of the world.Example: NVDA holdings make up 2.6% of this portfolio, because it makes up 2.6% of the world market cap.VONG = Vanguard Russell 1000 Growth. Top 1000 companies in the US, focusing more on equity as opposed to dividends.Example: NVDA makes up 8.16% of the portfolio.Conclusion: 90% of my portfolio is 2 funds, both of which own NVDA. So my owning percentage of NVDA is 0.9(2.6+8.16)...or 9.7%. Nearly 10% of my portfolio is NVDA, and another 10% MSFT, another 10% AAPL...because these are all similar sized companies.I know VT overlaps with VONG a lot. But I just want more US based growth exposure because of the economic strength. The international stocks included are really just a hedge.",0,0.548,POSITIVE,0.887
