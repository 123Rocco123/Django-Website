,"I am keeping a track of all semiconduct news and their impact on companies for my job, I thought sharing those with you may help. This week in semiconductor industry: Geopolitics - The Biden administration is set to announce a probe into China's semiconductor industry, focusing on potential unfair trade practices and national security concerns. NVDA -3.46%, AMD -2.13%, INTC 1.39%, TSM 3.11%, SMIC -3.17% [5 day change] Geopolitics - China has imposed a complete export ban on critical minerals—gallium, germanium, and antimony—disrupting global semiconductor supply chains and escalating trade tensions with the United States. NVDA -3.46%, AMD -2.13%, INTC 1.39%, TSM 3.11%, SMIC -3.17% [5 day change] Competition - Broadcom's significant growth in AI chip revenue challenges Nvidia's dominance, signaling a shift in the semiconductor industry's competitive landscape. AVGO 39.82%, NVDA -3.46%, AMD -2.13%, MRVL 5.22% [5 day change] Market - Kioxia, a leading Japanese memory chipmaker, has completed its IPO, raising ¥120 billion and achieving a market valuation of over ¥820 billion. Market - Infineon plans to enhance its local semiconductor manufacturing capabilities in China, aiming to better serve the growing demand in the Chinese market. IFX 0.94%, NXPI 0.50%, STM -1.49% [5 day change] Product - Intel's $250 Arc B580 ""Battlemage"" GPU has received widespread acclaim and has sold out rapidly following positive reviews. INTC 1.39%, NVDA -3.46%, AMD -2.13% [5 day change] Innovation - Seagate has introduced its 32TB Exos M hard drives, marking the first general availability of HAMR technology in the data storage industry. STX -3.18%, WDC -6.07%, 6502.T 1.53% [5 day change] Let me know if you have suggestions to improve.","China has imposed a complete export ban on critical minerals—gallium, germanium, and antimony—disrupting global semiconductor supply chains and escalating trade tensions with the United States.for decades Chia has used government subsides to produce more than the market need san then dumps the material on the international market are very low prices. Forcing other producers of the metal out of buisness. Allowing china to create a monopoly. The rest of the world has now knows what china is doing and as a result scansions and tarriffs are bing used to punish china for this and to encourage other other companies to reopen there mines. Gallium, germanium and antimony are not rare. They are everywhere. Antimony is mainly used a lead sustiute in bullets. Gallium and germanium are used in special RF circuits and very specialized chips. Most microprocessors and memory chips don't use these metals.China has used the same subsidy and dump policy on electric vehicles, solar and they ar trying in semiconductors. But most of the semiconductor manufacturing equipment and spare parts are not made in china. Most are made in the US so china is having a hard time with semiconductor ship manufacturing.",0,0.526,NEGATIVE,0.994
