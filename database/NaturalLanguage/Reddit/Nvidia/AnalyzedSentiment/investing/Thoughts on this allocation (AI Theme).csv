If your answer is yes, it can be good for you, if you have faith in them regardless of their initial returns. If you aren't willing to stomach a downturn, I wouldn't recommend it.Look to 1999 to see what can happen when investing in the most innovative industries. ""Fidelity Select Technology"" fund declined by roughly 85% in value over the course of 2.5 years, and took 20 years to reach its previous highs. So it is important to be cautious when investing in a single industry.",0,0.528,0.999,NEGATIVE
