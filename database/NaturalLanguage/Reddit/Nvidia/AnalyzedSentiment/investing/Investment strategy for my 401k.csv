,"I'm looking to roll my 401k into index funds, it was previously sitting in a low-yield bond; which is my fault, I didn't pay attention. now I'm looking to invest it better, I'm looking CHAT, VTSAX, VTI, VGT, VOO, intel, nvidia, XLY and LQD. so i'm looking for a general idea on what I should look at more closely. I have a six figure sum lookin to invest for the next 20 years. I was checking out CHAT, NVIDA, SMH mostly for the AI boom. Any advice or insight would be appreciated. I understand no one is a financial advisor and I hold no one responsible. Thank you.",In reality putting it into an index fund like VOO is always going to be the safest bet and one that will still likely perform extremely well. It also has a low fee. Most would say keep investments into individual stocks like Nvidia and Intel to 5-10% of your total but that is based on your risk tolerance.,0,0.535,POSITIVE,0.651

I'm just torn on which ones, other than ones I imagined. But I'll do that, 5 to 10% seems reasonable. hope the intel foundry works out lol",1,0.533,POSITIVE,0.664

Most, not all. Regardless, for retirement investments (not sure your age), it's still wisest to put them in index funds like VOO, VTI, VT, etc. It's pretty inevitable that these will yield solid returns over the period of investment (20-40 years depending on your age and your target retirement age).",0,0.522,NEGATIVE,0.509

Thank you.","Yeah I have time that the funds can sit in there. the one thing I'm always hearing is individual stocks should be about 5 to 10% of your portfolio, diversify your investment. But I also do know index fund is the safest and best option.Alright thank you so much, I hope the next 30+ years goes well lol",1,0.555,POSITIVE,0.99

It's totally fine to bet on some individual companies that you think will do better than the overall market (i.e. index funds), but it is far riskier, hence the 5-10% of your portfolio suggestion.I hope the next 30+ years goes well lolIf they don't, you won't be worrying about your 401k.",2,0.532,POSITIVE,0.822

Thank you.","I think the thing people typically say is that individual stocks should be no more than 5 to 10% of your portfolio. If you are someone who wants to take risk/gamble that you can choose better than the market weight. That's different than individual stocks should be 5 to 10% of your portfolio. Not everyone wants to try to choose. Some people really enjoy it. Know what you're getting into and the chances that those individual choices will most likely underperform the index in the long term, then decide for yourself if that risk is right for you",2,0.525,POSITIVE,0.627

I suggest you consider something like 65% ETFs eg: 30%VOO, 15%VGT, 10%VUG, and 10%XLG. For your remaining positions I would recommend 35% in positions that provide both diversification and income from materials and mining positions eg: 10%BHP, 10%RIO , 7.5%GNR and 7.5%XME.For disclosure this is very much my own portfolio. You should also note that am retired, and believe most retirees are best served by similar portfolios, ie : Equity positions to provide growth and Materials/Mining positions to provide growth and to further boost up dividend income.",0,0.524,NEGATIVE,0.987
