Like what could be more important when you’re investing in a company then whether or not that company is doing well and it’s guidance for the future?Yes, it is literally the most important thing in any stock season. Or do you just invest based on the names of stocks? Or maybe the color of their logos? Their choice of unisex bathrooms?And since it’s such an important metric, having insight what it is beforehand, the whisper number, or any other insight, is going to have an influence on share price. You can call that speculation. But it seems to be based on a whole lot of factors besides horse racing statistics. Either that or economics is a big fat sham. “Pfft, interest rates.”If you’re a buy and hold ETF maniac (which is perfectly valid) I don’t even know why you need to post or read the posts. Do your thing and move along. There’s nothing for you here. But how about let the forum do forum stuff?Or are you gonna post in every single thread where someone ask something about any company and accuse them of speculation?Sorry for the rant, but I feel it’s a pretty valid question. Whatever the company. Whatever the season. You don’t have to like the company. But it seems incredibly shortsighted to slam people for asking investing questions in an investing forum",1,0.547,NEGATIVE,1.0
