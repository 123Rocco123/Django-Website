In NVDA, there was very little volume in the 900s, so a large trade in the opposite direction caused the stack to tank. NVDA gapped down from approx 940 to 900. So, folks with calls had to exit those positions (i.e. selling delta >> market makers had to sell underlying to stay delta neutral).There is a ton on call gamma at 900+, but it could take 2 weeks or so to get there. Unless of course CPI data comes in soft, which could be the needed catalyst, causing a quick increase (gap up).You may want to look at r/TradingEdge for more market specific info (I have nothing to do with that subreddit - I just find it useful to understand market dynamics).If I had more time to evaluate/confirm data, I would look at buying a 0.5-0.6 delta call for 5/19.

Their largest customers being companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Dell, all of whom are supposed to be capable of implementing the technology. Microsoft, Google, and Dell all make branded hardware, too, albeit not necessarily in the component part aspect of the supply chain. But Dell recently had a stock pop of valuation, which may well have taken away some opportunity from Nvidia investment, which outflows may have been seen last week. There is a zero sum amount of money which can be invested from the public, so major brands like Apple may eventually get tired of playing second fiddle, if they can help it - which remains to be seen.",2,0.542,0.649,POSITIVE

At some point it surpassed most of the big car companies combined and the market cap made no sense, yet it still kept going up.AI is the next big thing. We were primed for an intense market crash, but AI changed that and we've had a bull run ever since. I don't believe AI will get that much better for the next 5 years at least, so what's really going to make or break an AI company imo is having the latest and fastest hardware. And Nvidia knows how to milk this with their yearly new series, they know exactly what they're doing and they know they have the best hardware for the job.It might dip a bit because 1000$ will freak people out, but I'll be buying. I missed the start of the bull run (only held what I already had), I'll make sure to buy the dip.",2,0.553,0.864,POSITIVE

If every author on earth sued Nvidia, It still wouldn’t be statistically significant to their share price. That isn’t as much a reflection of Nvidia, as it is just how little authors are paid.But they are hardware manufacturer. If they used copywritten material to train a software… That just seems like a really big disconnect. Not only would it be such a tiny amount going into the code, but it would be indistinguishable by pretty much anyone on the planet, including other AI.Stocks, go up and stocks go down. There doesn’t have to be any kind of conspiracy or motive or major contributing factor for any type of movement. To repeat my father for the millionth time, sometimes the stock is up because the stock is up. Or down.It is curious how AI and copyright are going to Butt heads in the future. But I think it’s more discernible with visual and audio. Out of 120,000 word book, you gotta think that they’re also training off maybe 100 million other words. Or far more, I don’t know.You’re not gonna find one sentence that’s the same or even remotely the same. The only way they could ever detect This is if someone literally told them. So they must’ve had a data sheet on what was being trained. And I believe I saw a mention of that in the article but I just don’t feel like reading it again.It’s very hard to prove copyright infringement of words, unless you’re really wholesale taking the same stuff. Because we’ve got limited vocabularies. You can look at a dictionary and it’s all right there. You can’t copyright anything in there. All you can do is copyright the very specific way you string it together and present it.
