,"Hey fellow Redditors, I've been diligently building my ETF portfolio in my Roth IRA, but lately, I've been questioning whether I have too many ETFs and if there's potential overlap or duplication issues. I want to ensure that my investments are as diverse as possible, but I'm not confident in my investing knowledge. That's why I need your expertise and feedback on my current holdings! Here's my portfolio list: Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) MSCI Inc. (MSCI) Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) Fidelity Government Money Market Fund (SPAXX) SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) Vanguard Target Retirement 2060 Fund (VTTSX) Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) I'm genuinely concerned that I may have too much overlap or duplicates among these ETFs, potentially undermining the diversification I was aiming for. Additionally, as a relatively inexperienced investor, I would greatly appreciate your thoughts on the overall health of my portfolio.",You absolutely have too much overlap. SPY/VOO/VTI/VTTSX should all be in one of those. The remaining is why QQQ and the individual stocks? Why energy sector by itself? Do you have a reason you want to over allocate into those stocks/sectors and do you still believe in those reasons?Typically with a Target date fund (VTTSX) you either put 100% into it or 0%.,0,0.519,1.0,NEGATIVE

I think you're asking questions that I should know the answers to, but do not. It's obvious I'm in a bit deep here and I don't quite know information that is key to having a strong portfolio.

Your balance sheet. How much of each of these you have. How much you know about these investments.Given this, not sure what we can tell you.Here are a few general comments:It looks like a lot of things to keep track of. You seem to be rather tech heavy. (Or not depending on how much of each you own.) How much do you know about each of these investments? Have you done research or are you just relying on comments from friends or Motley Fool?

Roughly 80% of the weight of VTI is the entirety of the other 2 (which are internally identical).Why do you believe that ""which of the US exchanges a stock trades on"" is a key factor in future outperformance (QQQ)?VTTSX is designed to be the only fund you gold. It already covers everything else you have there.Why have any money in SPAXX?Which brokerage is this with? You have a Vanguard TDF but a Fidelity MMF, that's usually not a good sign.How did you come up with this portfolio?",0,0.521,0.991,NEGATIVE

There is nothing wrong with this mix except VOO and SPY are the exact same but VOO is slightly cheaper. Sell SPY and put it into VOO. VTI is close to VOO, but not the same, so having both is okay... unless you didn't realize they were so close, then you need to decide what percentage of your funds you want in the S&P500 (VOO) and what percentage you want in the total US market (VOO + the rest of the US companies) whih is VTI.The other choices just amount to going heavier in certain areas, which is fine if that is what you believe in.",0,0.512,0.883,NEGATIVE
