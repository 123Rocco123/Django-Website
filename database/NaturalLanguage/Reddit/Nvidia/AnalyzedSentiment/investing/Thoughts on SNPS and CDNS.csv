,"Synopsys (SNPS) and Cadence (CDNS) are a near-duopoly in the EDA space (chip-design software and related), and both are popping nicely today (7% and 5% at the moment), undoubtedly due to NVIDIA’s rise today (15% atm), since NVIDIA is a major customer for both. Both of these EDA stocks have had massive rises in the past decade (13x and 19x), and are now at P/Es of 73 and 80 respectively. What are your thoughts on these two companies, and their stocks? Obviously they should reflect the chip market, but are these PEs sustainable? Any potential big risks on the horizon for the chip market?","Op-Ed: If you study their financials and listen to their calls they have both successfully cut costs (i.e. RIF'ed or enticed old/expensive staff to retire or be forced out) where they greatly cut payroll at the top end in order to be able to afford younger, more productive talent. The tools are all mostly legacy, meaning the algorithms have been discovered, the optimizations have been performed and the enhancements are relatively simple compared to the early days when algorithms were being discovered. Moore's law has mostly decelerated and their problem is much easier to deal with. Suspect that they have cut the fat significantly of VPs, group directors and middle management who contribute almost zero incrementally to the bottom line.",0,0.516,0.639,NEGATIVE
