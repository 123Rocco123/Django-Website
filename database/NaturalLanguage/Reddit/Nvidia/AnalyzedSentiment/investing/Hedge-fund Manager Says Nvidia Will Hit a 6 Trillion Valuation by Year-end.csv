,"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/hedge-fund-manager-says-nvidia-will-hit-6-trillion-valuation-year-end-1725152 Hedge fund manager Eric Jackson has made a bold prediction regarding Nvidia's stock performance, forecasting that it will reach $250 per share by the end of the year. This projection implies a potential upside of over 100% from its current trading levels, positioning Nvidia to achieve a remarkable $6 trillion valuation. Jackson, who utilises a proprietary AI and machine learning-driven algorithm at EMJ Capital to pick long and short tech equities, believes Nvidia's historic rally will continue throughout the year. Jackson highlighted Nvidia's price-earnings (P/E) multiple trends over the past five years, noting that the average forward P/E multiple has been 40 times. Following the recent correction, the forward P/E was 39 times. Historically, Nvidia's P/E multiple has exceeded 50 times on three occasions and approached 70 times twice, indicating potential for further growth. Jackson believes that as the market recognises the success of Blackwell chips in the second half of the year, coupled with favourable gross margins and the anticipation of upcoming Rubin chips, investor euphoria will drive Nvidia's valuation higher. Jackson emphasised Nvidia's significant advantage over its rivals, dismissing comparisons to Cisco during the dot-com bubble as unfounded.","Translation.

,"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/hedge-fund-manager-says-nvidia-will-hit-6-trillion-valuation-year-end-1725152 Hedge fund manager Eric Jackson has made a bold prediction regarding Nvidia's stock performance, forecasting that it will reach $250 per share by the end of the year. This projection implies a potential upside of over 100% from its current trading levels, positioning Nvidia to achieve a remarkable $6 trillion valuation. Jackson, who utilises a proprietary AI and machine learning-driven algorithm at EMJ Capital to pick long and short tech equities, believes Nvidia's historic rally will continue throughout the year. Jackson highlighted Nvidia's price-earnings (P/E) multiple trends over the past five years, noting that the average forward P/E multiple has been 40 times. Following the recent correction, the forward P/E was 39 times. Historically, Nvidia's P/E multiple has exceeded 50 times on three occasions and approached 70 times twice, indicating potential for further growth. Jackson believes that as the market recognises the success of Blackwell chips in the second half of the year, coupled with favourable gross margins and the anticipation of upcoming Rubin chips, investor euphoria will drive Nvidia's valuation higher. Jackson emphasised Nvidia's significant advantage over its rivals, dismissing comparisons to Cisco during the dot-com bubble as unfounded.",Market manipulation,0,0.625,NEGATIVE,0.993
