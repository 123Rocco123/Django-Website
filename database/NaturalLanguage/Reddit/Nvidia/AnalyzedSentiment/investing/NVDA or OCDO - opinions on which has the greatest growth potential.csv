,"As per title really, I’ve been watching both. Nvidia seems to an a pure AI play, and Ocado seems to be a play on automation/robotics in the grocery sector. I read things like this about Nvidia, which makes me think they’ve peaked (we have copilot at work and I don’t see any practical applications), and things like this about Ocado - which point towards potential but high debt. I’m leaning towards Ocado because I feel as though AI is not going anywhere until AGI, and I wonder if the real world opportunity presented by Ocado’s partnerships in America, Canada and Japan offers a multi-bag opportunity. What are your thoughts? Should I jump on the NVDA bandwagon and YOLO, or take a punt with a company that has huge potential, but high debt???? Ps. If it helps, I’m only investing cash I can afford to lose.",Stop buying stocks before you lose all your money. Best to index for ppl like you,0,0.53,POSITIVE,0.923

You don't really know which of these companies will experience the most significant growth in the next years so you should invest a little bit in all of them. The problem is that investing in all of these companies is kind of time-consuming and annoying, so maybe you could look into financial products that mirror a whole index. I heard good things about S&P500 ETFs, maybe you should look into those...",0,0.539,NEGATIVE,0.999

But something I read that helped my decision (ignoring short term volatility going on with focus on long term investing) is that while Nvidia remains a market leader and continues to innovate, go with it. If you begin to see Nvidia losing their edge in being that market leader then that’s when it’s time to consider possibly jumping ship. Otherwise, don’t overly worry about short term market ups and downs",0,0.539,NEGATIVE,0.736

Looks neat does not = great business. I don't think it's a 0 and maybe down 85% from the covid peak it's gotten a bit overhated, but this is a business that has continually acted as if it is where things are headed and two decades later they haven't. 3-4 years ago everyone thought ""the time for delivery is now"" and once again, today it seems like ... not really. Building robotic fulfillment centers is not cheap and if you're not going to sustain covid-like levels of delivery, it's not easy to justify.Ocado was founded 24 years ago and this year they have a goal for ""profit at pretax level in 6 years."" So by the time the company is 30 years old - and that's just a goal, not necessarily one that'll be reached.""Close your eyes and you might have thought Ocado was announcing good news. Both its partners in North America, Kroger in the US and Sobeys in Canada, have announced “strong growth in digital sales” in their latest quarterly updates, the UK firm said excitedly. But, oh dear. What Thursday’s statement was really relaying was that Sobeys, like Kroger last year, has hit the pause button on opening more warehouses filled with Ocado’s robots. A fourth Canadian “customer fulfilment centre” (CFC), due to open in Vancouver next year, will be delayed, even though it is mostly built.""
