,"I've seen so many posts saying Nvidia, the sky is still the limit. But I just want to call this out: the US government has thrown down the gauntlet with them. Basically the government said, don't try and tweak the chips to get around the restrictions on china. The statement basically said that the government will classify the chips as restricted as quickly as Nvidia can develop them. 20-25% of Nvidia revenue comes from china. This won't wipe all of that out, but it will eat into it. This makes it even harder for Nvidia to achieve record growth. Oh, and make no mistake: with the P/E as high as it is, it's not enough for Nvidia to do well: it has to do EXTREMELY well to justify it's valuation. IMO, the downside risk in the short term is far higher than the upside risk. That is the risk with chasing market leaders, as so many people do. By the time a stock looks like it's so good how can you not own it, you're already far behind the best opportunities for gains and possibly already in the danger zone.","I mean, it is growing revenues by whopping multiples, even without China. Its operating margins are 60- something",0,0.528,POSITIVE,0.786

Some good ways to think about this - the product is so good, the US doesn't want them to sell it abroad. Also, demand is so high and supply is limited so if China is out, it's more room for others to buy. It's ridiculous that NVIDIA beat earnings by 2 billion in the last quarterly, and the stock is a maybe. No other company has done this in the history of the market. its funny that people are reluctant to be bullish.",0,0.586,NEGATIVE,0.953

I just don't believe that there is the room for growth that necessary to justify the current P/E. Remember, when a stocks price is this far above it's actual earnings, it's not enough for the company to do well: it has to do absurdly well. This is one of many headwinds facing Nvidia. They will likely continue to lead the market, but they won't be able to achieve the meteoric growth they saw in the last year, which will cause the stock to come down.",1,0.597,NEGATIVE,1.0

The problem of course is they're growing so fast that it's hard to estimate long term growth or if it turns out to be a cyclical period that fizzles out.
