,"Exxon Mobil was America’s most valuable publicly traded company for much of the 2000s & early 2010s, as the oil booms during those periods delivered enormous profits. Since the mid-2010s, Apple (and eventually the rest of Big Tech) began to exceed Big Oil’s profits. For much of the past decade, Apple has been the most profitable and most valuable U.S. company, occasionally trading places with Microsoft, the 2nd most profitable U.S. company. Which brings us to the current situation. Microsoft is worth $3.2 trillion; Apple is worth $2.9. Microsoft is actually making slightly less profit than Apple but has a shown a higher earnings growth trajectory in recent quarters/years. NVIDIA is worth $2.8 and making about a tenth of MS & Apple’s profits, but might double or triple its earnings this year. One of 3 things can happen: NVIDIA takes #1 and grows into its valuation NVIDIA takes #1 then loses it because it fails to grow into its valuation Wall Street pumps Apple & MS stock higher so this never becomes an issue It should be noted the last time the most valuable company did NOT make the most profits, that was Cisco in the early 2000s … and it didn’t end well.","It's not an issue of ""highest"", and MSFT and AAPL are irrelevant. It's a simple relationship between valuation and earnings. When valuations rise so far above earnings, the company MUST increase earnings rapidly in a big way or else the valuation will come back down again.",0,0.586,NEGATIVE,0.867

Idk when that is. Right now they have software like margins for a hardware company... But no one is mentioning the software behind that hardware that is powering these margins. Most AI software is dependent on their software libraries for their hardware. My company decided to build a non-Nvidia based GPU super computer, and it is mostly just sitting idle. Most AI software won't run on it. And building software that would is cost prohibitive. I say this just to say that they will be very difficult to catch by other hardware manufacturers who are targeting their margin (your margin is my opportunity). So IMO, they are going to keep running up in price until the build out finishes, which could be months, years, or decades. No one really knows for sure.",0,0.558,NEGATIVE,1.0

Who is building these systems (who is the customers of Nvidia)? Right now it has been just a few tech giants (MSFT, TSLA, META, etc.), but we are going to see this spread to governments across the world. Look up the list of super computers in the world, these are the types of places that will want to build more AI compute clusters. There's a bit of a race right now to build these systems, but we are still at the start. Governments are just now starting to take action.Think of it like building the internet in the 1990s and cisco building out a lot of the infrastructure.The question is what is the end point. Sort of like the end point for the internet was when everything was connected. The end point (perhaps just a temporary one) for AI will be when we reach some sort of constraint. Maybe the algorithms used today for training stop getting better with additional compute. We haven't seen any evidence of this yet. Or perhaps we run out of data to train on (but then there is synthetic data, or more data refinement). Or perhaps we just get a system that is so good, almost perfect, that there isn't much point in pushing too much further, at least not so fast.I can see the next set of systems could easily be 10x todays systems. Could they be 100x? idk, i just can't see that far ahead.",2,0.53,POSITIVE,0.986

The problem NVDA has though is it's biggest customers are already building and have their own GPUs. They are not as good as NVDA's best GPUs, but the pace of improvement in both hardware and LLM models means they will not necessarily need the best.For example, it's estimated Meta spent ~1/3 of it's capex on NVDA GPUs last year to the tune of ~10.5B. Do you think Meta is going to up that even more? I have a hard time seeing who else is going to spend that kind of money year and year out, while also increasing the spend [1].The other huge customers - MS, Google, and AWS are in similar situations.
