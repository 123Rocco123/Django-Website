,"The recent nVidia split has me wondering if I understand the mechanics of how organized markets set prices around split events. The split chronology, per nVidia's FAQ about it, is: May 22 - 10:1 split announced Thursday, June 6 - record date for entitlement to split Friday, June 7 - distribution of split shares Monday, June 10 - split shares start trading, at about 1/10 the price Nasdaq's published closing prices around the split dates were: 6/5 - 1224.40 6/6 - 1209.98 6/7 - 1208.88 6/10 - 121.79 (BTW, not easy to find the actual pre-split prices on the internet. EVERYBODY ""adjusts"" prices ASAP.) *** BUT *** With T+1 settlement, no buyer of nVidia on either the Thursday or the Friday of that week would have paid over $1200 for a share that would not be entitled to the split shares distributed after the close on Friday. Did brokers show when-issued prices to their clients on the Thursday and Friday? Adjust the quotes they showed? Is there some standard, perhaps mandatory, mechanism for brokerage back offices to fix up the prices on all Thursday and Friday trades? How did that work?","the split is adjusted after the close, anyone who bough any shares regardless of settlement by cob will get the split, a split has no economic dead weight loss (apart from factional shares) your mtm value pre and post split is exactly identical. if you had 1 share pre-split worth 1100, post split you have 10 shares worth 1100 and the price is no 110.0. nothing about your pnl or cost basis changes with a split.",0,0.52,NEGATIVE,1.0

How did that work?","I understand there is no economic gain or loss from the split. I'm not asking about that.The nVidia FAQ about this split says, ""Each record holder of common stock as of the close of market on Thursday, June 6, 2024, will receive nine additional shares of common stock, to be distributed after the close of market on Friday, June 7, 2024.""Imagine it's that Friday. Market price is say $1200. I buy 10 shares, paying $12000. I cannot possibly be a record holder on the day before, as nVidia requires, to be issued the 90 new shares.I am sure on the following Monday, having laid out 12 grand and with NVDA now around 120, my broker will say I own 100 of the new NVDA, but someone somewhere is shading the truth about the details of what happens when and how. Either NVDA's record date is a fib, or the Friday market price was a fib, or my broker converted my buy 10 NVDA order into buy 100 NVDA(WI), or what?",1,0.562,NEGATIVE,0.998
