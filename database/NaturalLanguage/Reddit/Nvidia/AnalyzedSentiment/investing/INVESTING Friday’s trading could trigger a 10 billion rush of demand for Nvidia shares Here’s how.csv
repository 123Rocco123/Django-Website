,"The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) has an upcoming rebalance based on Friday’s market caps. At stake is one of the top two spots in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), whose June rebalance is based on market cap values as of Friday’s close. Apple and Microsoft are the two biggest holdings in the fund, at roughly 22% each. Nvidia makes up less than 6% despite being only slightly behind the two leaders in market cap. Projections from a June 12 UBS note suggested that, if Nvidia climbs to second and bumps Apple to third, it could result in the chipmaker’s weight in the fund vaulting to 21%, while Apple would be slimmed down to just 4.5%. A 15 percentage point swing in Nvidia’s weight would mean that the fund would need to acquire more than $10 billion worth of shares in the chipmaker — all on or very close to June 21, the rebalance date. https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/14/fridays-trading-could-trigger-a-10-billion-rush-of-demand-for-nvidia-shares-heres-how.html",Since I hold XLK and NVDA this will be something to watch.

It would be selling AAPL at an all time high but buying NVDA at a high. Would this mean we’d expect XLK to stay about the same value but express concern about buying NVDA at such an inflated value?,0,0.52,NEGATIVE,1.0
