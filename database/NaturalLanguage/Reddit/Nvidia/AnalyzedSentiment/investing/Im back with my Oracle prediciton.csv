,"Im back with my Oracle predicitin Previously i posted about oracle gains and I got blasted… With Oracle now at a ATH and up 17% in the month & 37% on the 6 month, is the consensus still bearish on Oracle? And do we think these sudden gain are sustainable? With the AI boom happening and the recent contract talks Oracle has been in, do we see Oracle as a big player in the AI sector? And yes… I understand Nvidia is out there… There are many pieces to the AI boom aside from chip manufacturers. Infrastructures and data centers is the market share Oracle is after (IMO)","I'm deep in the cloud/infrastructure/database industry. There isn't a more universally hated company in tech than Oracle. They're the Nestle of IT. Broadcom is the only one giving them a run for their money, and that's just in the past year.I don't know how they stay in business with all awful reputation and hate they get. I suspect when it comes to IT spend, business IT leaders looks past the reputation and Oracle comes in with killer discounts (temporarily) that makes the IT leaders say ""this is good enough to not move off Oracle for now"" and then renew for another contract. Or it's a cycle of ""big bill, we have no choice but to pay this now, lets move off Oracle before our next renewal, momentum fades as the immediate pain ends when the bill is paid, you sit idle for a few years, then you get a big bill again"".That being said I was an AWS Solutions Architect (part of an AWS sales team) and we had a customer comparing us to Oracle Cloud and I thought ""surely no one would go with Oracle in this climate"". We involved a bunch of internal ex-Oracle folks and they said ""their cloud is actually engineered really good, don't sleep on the fact it is well engineering and reliable"". Then we had our competitive situation get hit with some crazy shit like ""Oracle is going us give you 2 years of free hosting"" which we could never compete with. I left before I heard the final outcome, but there are definitely people still willing to do business with Oracle.So I guess my point here is, the stock market doesn't seem to care about the Oracle perception and hate, so you're going to hear every IT person complain about how terrible it is. But somehow they're getting real meaningful sales results and obviously stock market gains.",0,0.554,NEGATIVE,1.0

The people making the buying decisions or the people responsible for working with it? My guess is the latter. Universally hated tends to mean very little for acquisition. See Salesforce, Jira, et al.

I work in ERP systems and constantly hear how bad Oracle DBs are (I hate them myself) but yet nothing ever actually happens. With that, I also agree that IT decision makers are still using Oracle and that’s translating to AI. Its an interesting stock to say the least.As for the Oracle contracts, Ive sat on calls with Oracle reps and they go over my companies contract and it blows my mind we agree to certain t&cs",1,0.533,NEGATIVE,0.985
