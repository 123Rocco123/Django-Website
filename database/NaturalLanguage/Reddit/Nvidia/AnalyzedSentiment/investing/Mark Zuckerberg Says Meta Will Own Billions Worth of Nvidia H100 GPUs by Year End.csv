But the original Facebook got to millions of users with a hand-full of engineers, and Google's attempts like Circles fell flat.Big organizations aren't set up well to innovate.

Big corporations do not tend to innovate well. So Meta has billions worth of GPUs, what’s the plan for them? Boring AI driven market analysis? Streaming mixed reality services? Work on the cure for cancer? How long until Mark gets bored with the data center he builds around all those GPUs that will eventually need to be replaced? What could Meta possibly do to recoup costs on something like that, which will cost additional millions of dollars to simply power? What will turn something like that into a profit?I don’t believe there is going to be a breakthrough must-have innovation here. Nor a charitable research effort for the betterment of humanity.

Moreso I meant boring as in, it’s a commodity at this point with multiple companies offering services/resources. And I was further tying that back to the comment I was replying to that large corporations generally do not innovate as easily as startups that take more risks. So when I say boring, I’m not sayin unprofitable…it likely won’t be up front as R&D will be a decent chunk of bringing all of these GPUs online for AI services. But will have to wait and see how those services stack with what’s already out there too…just not compelling enough yet to buy more Meta when we don’t know how they shape the service.
