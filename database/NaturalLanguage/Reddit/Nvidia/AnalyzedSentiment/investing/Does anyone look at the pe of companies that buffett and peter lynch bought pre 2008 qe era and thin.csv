,"Does anyone look at the pe of companies that buffett and peter lynch bought pre 2008 qe era and think about how lucky they were and that they had more opportunities than everyone else today? They used to buy companies at 2 x earnings 3 x earnings. That used to be normal. Now, it's like do you want to buy amazon at 100x or nvidia at 100x earnings? What is that going to do for average real returns? I never see people on this forum talk about actual earnings. They only talk about if they bought a stock and it went up not the actual returns or earnings of the companies.",You can't look at PE ratios alone. They exist alongside interest rates and inflation as their primary context.Buying companies with a PE of 10 is a lot less appealing back in the day when inflation and interest rates were 10%,0,0.517,0.904,POSITIVE

Those PE's were insane back then too.Why are you focused on NVDA and AMZN? Just look at other companies if you think that tech is overvalued.,0,0.53,0.999,NEGATIVE

I had some too and proudly cashed in with a 50% profit! Warren held is shares. Warren is richer than me. Buying is important. Holding a winner as it runs is what made Lynch and Buffett filthy rich.

Many investors have really simple arguments, telling you stocks only increase in value over time, but it's also likely that the last three decades of returns were heavily influenced by artificial factors.So, you're not wrong. Buffett and Lynch just so happened to hit that sweet economic window with amazing demographics and expansion. That could be difficult to replicate in our lifetimes.""I show that the decline in interest rates and corporate tax rates over the past three decades accounts for the majority of the period’s exceptional stock market performance. Lower interest expenses and corporate tax rates mechanically explain over 40 percent of the real growth in corporate profits from 1989 to 2019. In addition, the decline in risk-free rates alone accounts for all of the expansion in price-to-earnings multiples. I argue, however, that the boost to profits and valuations from ever-declining interest and corporate tax rates is unlikely to continue, indicating significantly lower profit growth and stock returns in the future.""https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2023041pap.pdf",0,0.538,0.665,NEGATIVE

I also think there's always an opportunity in some corner of the market - you just don't know which one.With that said, there's some truth to the idea that higher PE ratios means that, on average, current investors are paying a higher premium for the same return. That may be due to the rise of the 401k or retail investors, who knows. With that said, I'm still sure we're going to look back at the present in 20 years and wonder why some certain investors did so much better than others, so I put more if my energy into trying to be one of those people rather than comparing the current market to past ones.",0,0.565,0.58,NEGATIVE

The economy is significantly larger today and thus there are far more opportunities available today. Real GDP (this removes inflation) is up 65% since 2000.
