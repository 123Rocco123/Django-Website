We've seen this in the data. If you care for the environment, lobby at the governmental level. You wont do it in the equity markets.",2,0.511,NEGATIVE,0.999

Put it into things like Hmax. in a margin account so I'm essentially pulling 39-45% in distributions on my Nvidia money before interest calculations. I know the math doesn't really work like that, but in context since I don't anticipate much NAV erosion it does. I'm not ignorant to growth, I use xeqt but there's 1000 options, and it doesn't seem the best of them. I do however subscribe to the saying bulls get fat, bears get fat, pigs get slaughtered. I made a very very good years worth, now Im relatively conservatively setting up the perpetual ability to make new investments. I'm not a professional, but I do spend an almost obsessive amount of time on my account so the benefits wouldn't be necessarily realized if your passively investing.The part where that relates to your post I suppose is my beliefs that4% dividends aren't worth your time if that's what your investing based in. I'd rather invest in the same companies, give up the hypothetical growth, and get a for sure payment that's what I can hope for overall anyway.Idk about you , but as far as I'm concerned tech is where the growth is going to be still. Meaning I want exposure, but I'm not expecting anything to grow the same anyway. so I want cash to invest opportunistically",0,0.55,NEGATIVE,0.999
