I think Joma Tech and his skits about Blindr expresses what I'm talking about.In this case listening to the earnings call had a sales pitch kind of vibe where they swept some things under the rug and were trying to sell/promote/inflate themselves less as a GPU company and more as a AI tech company, inserting AI in the conversation as much as possible.I think the best analogy or comparison I've got right now is how Tesla is a car company but there's contention about it being a tech company but I'm not sure what's substantial or something that's hyped/'vaporware' to inflate the company, like the solar panels.The company valuation and stock price feels like a bubble.",2,0.602,0.999,NEGATIVE

If 3 years later nothing has changed, why is the stock a best performing stock? Shouldn't the forward PE continually be adjusted? NVDA being a GROWTH company doesn't seem to be growing, at least not according to its forward valuation, which is a huge red flag. Especially if you have to lower your expectations (as they did after the last earnings) and then just barely beat those.I mean, you have to agree, there's a limit to how much a valuation strays from company fundamentals.

I don't care about day to day gyrations, it's about the long term growth prospects.Happy to discuss their technology and outlook with anybody. This company will be one of the largest high tech companies in the world, top 3 by market cap, within 3-5 years. That isn't a popular view to many, I get it, but there is no question they are doing it right, taking the chip and hardware leadership mantle, building unique solutions, adding value for customers, solving real world problems and making their technology critical in the markets they care about.I get the valuations are stretched, they have been for the most part for nearly the last 10 years. There is a reason for that, like quality earnings. Like being a cash printing machine. Like after more than quadrupling their business in the last 10 years they have no real competition. And like they're just scratching the surface of some enormous markets. It's always going to be expensive, growth generally is.What you say about propping up has some truth to it, sure. All I can do is pick my entry and hang on. This company just went through a major correction -- folks that believe another is imminent are, well, confused.

It could stagnate if it turns out people aren't that interested in things like smart home devices, wearables and self-driving cars, or they don't want new laptops and smartphones any more, and I suppose we might see some of that in the coming recession, but long term there's no reason to expect demand not to grow. I would not be investing in Intel right now as AMD and Arm are eating their lunch (expect more from Arm in coming years as they continue to expand out of the embedded market) but the desktop/laptop/server pendulum tends to swing between AMD and Intel every few years so it's probably not worth selling at a loss. In the short term we could actually see demand for chips increase, as countries that donated arms to Ukraine need to replenish their arsenals. Defence contractors are doing relatively well atm but I don't know what chips are used in weapons.IMO NVIDIA's drop was largely down to the Arm acquisition falling through and the hype being excised from the market, and now that it's corrected I don't see it dropping further unless the recession is worse than expected.",3,0.54,1.0,NEGATIVE
