,"The bubble will pop. We're in a very similar place to the tech bubble. Back then the bubble popped because companies didn't produce revenue to match the hype. Today this seems different because some companies are making money hand over fist. However, the companies making money are those producing the infrastructure for AI, we have yet to see much revenue generated from AI itself. The similarity is that we are expecting AI itself to generate revenue similar to the startups of the first tech bubble. Whether or not AI can generate revenue is a different topic. I'll simply say that the current expectations of AI don't match reality. Feel free to list the companies and products that leverage AI that are also generating significant revenue directly from that AI. Nvidia makes chips, Microsoft and others use these chips to provide AI infrastructure, the bubble is in everyone trying to use this infrastructure to create products that derive revenue. If that revenue doesn't materialize, demand will drop for infrastructure and correspondingly for chips.
