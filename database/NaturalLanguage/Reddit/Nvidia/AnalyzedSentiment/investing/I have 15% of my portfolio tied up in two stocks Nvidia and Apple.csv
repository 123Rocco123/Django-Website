In the pre-exponential part of the S curve. His big ones were the box stores in the 90s. Home Depot, Costco, Best Buy etc. they followed the Walmart trend. I believe the future is in electronics / AI.buy things you know and understand, things you like.So it’s Tesla right now. When they get closer to 6-7M cars sold a year they will be 50-70% of their total addressable market for cars.

I do have a small position in a recycling company which was a comparable amount as an extreme long term play an (and 5 shares of meme stock)...but the value of the Tesla position just exploded to the point where the rest doesn't even count anymore.And yes: I'm totally fine with the risk as well. It would be sad if that value were to go 'poof' as it now represents about 50% of my net worth but it wouldn't change my life.If you're fine with the risk and can shrug off any downturn - even a long term one where you may have to sell at significantly below today's value - with a smile and a shrug then you should be good with what you have.,0,0.566,0.998,NEGATIVE

Any input is greatly appreciated,"Just because you have a risk tolerance for being stupid, doesn't mean you should be stupid.Having a high risk tolerance doesn't change the risk consequences of your decisions.Just like many people are risk intolerant with their investments because they lack financial education and understanding behind investments, doesn't mean that them not having 90-100% stock portfolios throughout their working career is not a serious barrier to them growing wealth.I think people hide behind risk tolerance. There are times where you need to increase your tolerance and times you need to scale it back. Your risk tolerance can be wrong.Now if you lost 15% of your portfolio tomorrow, you may be able to say it won't destroy you, and that's fine. If that's the case go ahead and keep doing you. But don't let your ""risk tolerance"" tell you that what you are doing isn't likely going to lead you to lose a huge chunk of that money.Like don't be ignorant and use it as a rationalization. Having 15% of your NW in single stock is not recommended. Risk tolerance doesn't change the statistical probability its not a recommended decision.Everyone is free to do what they want. Just be honest about the risk.And someone who's NW is $2M at 35 and 15% is single stock is different than someone whos 45 NW is $300k and 15% of it is in single stock. Hopefully the 45 year old isn't pulling the ""I'm tolerant to losing it all"".Usually I see the opposite. People who invest in retirement in mostly money market or bonds and they hide behind the risk tolerance argument. Well 9 times out of 10 you ain't retiring.",0,0.532,0.997,NEGATIVE
