,"This is mostly a straight copy paste from a Barron’s article. I’ve been reading a lot more noise from the financial press about overheated values. So I tend to peruse the articles that give multiple sides or data supporting their claims. There are lots of Nvidia mentions, of course. But pretty much any pan market analysis is going to mention Nvidia. From Barron’s: https://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-market-rally-hottest-decades-1ca7bcf5 The S&P 500 has had an extraordinary few months, any way you slice it. The index is up more than 25% from its October lows, and as Deutsche Bank Macro Strategist Henry Allen writes, “The current rally is almost unprecedented.” The index is now up 15 out of the past 17 weeks, a feat that’s only happened one other time in the past half-century, in 1989. If it notches yet another gain this week, for 16 out of 18, it would be the first time that’s happened since 1971. Such a massive rally—largely resting on enthusiasm about artificial intelligence and a few big tech stocks —has led to concerns that we might be in a tech stock bubble Nvidia revenue and profits are quite real and they are growing at an astonishing rate. It results last week, the latest in a series of blowout quarters, is “Unprecedented. And it speaks to the power and durability of this A.I. craze,” notes Rosenberg Research President Dave Rosenberg. “Nvidia’s stellar results and positive guidance hammered home the point of how generative AI is proving to be transformative in every respect And while Nvidia’s valuation may be easy to justify, the S&P 500 as a whole looks pricey: It is now trading at almost 22 times forward earnings. As Essaye points out, a price-to-earnings ratio around that level was “previously only reserved for periods of quantitative easing and 0% rates, not quantitative tightening and 5.37% fed funds.” Of course, skeptics haven’t been right yet. The average year-end price target for the S&P 500 as tracked by FactSet, of 5,556, implies more than 9% upside left for the year. RBC Capital Markets has also argued that the index looks capable of supporting a valuation of 23.55 times. There is also the possibility for a near-term pullback before gains continue. [really? Is that possible??? /sarcasm] The numbers of the S&P are pretty startling to me. Kind of like when someone goes out in the basketball game and scores 60 points with 15 blocked shots. But one problem with all these algorithms, and back testing, is the past is the past. While human behavior tends to return in cycles, buying and selling of companies and technology, that hadn’t existed before is hard to be cyclical. Like I just read an article that the gardening nursery that had operated for 90 years in my home city was shutting down. It occupies 15 acres of unbelievably prime real estate, and they were using it to sell poinsettias and shrubs and trees to locals. This is to say: areas change, and businesses change and just because something operated, profitably, for 90 years doesn’t mean it’s going to operate for 100. We’ve seen the same with newspapers and magazines and comic books, and we’ve seen entire industries spring out of nothingness and become vast. Mobile games can rake in hundreds of millions of dollars. Popping virtual bubbles on a portable telephone he’s not a business model that existed when I was a kid. I doubt anyone even dreamed of it. Sooo, the S&P setting records can be alarming. Alarming if things that happened in the financial markets past need to happen or are likely to happen now. But sometimes things change sufficiently that the rules get thrown out. For all the talk of the past.com bubble, the boosters in 1999 were dead right in that the Internet changed everything. They were simply ahead by maybe five years, and things didn’t change so much that you could forgo earnings.","Nobody knows how this plays out.Unless you want to cash out of the market and hide your money under a mattress, there’s no point in worrying about whether this is a bubble.Stay invested through all the peaks and troughs, and you’ll probably be fine long term.",0,0.523,0.955,POSITIVE

The index is up more than 25% from its October lows, and as Deutsche Bank Macro Strategist Henry Allen writes, “The current rally is almost unprecedented.” The index is now up 15 out of the past 17 weeks, a feat that’s only happened one other time in the past half-century, in 1989. If it notches yet another gain this week, for 16 out of 18, it would be the first time that’s happened since 1971. Such a massive rally—largely resting on enthusiasm about artificial intelligence and a few big tech stocks —has led to concerns that we might be in a tech stock bubble Nvidia revenue and profits are quite real and they are growing at an astonishing rate. It results last week, the latest in a series of blowout quarters, is “Unprecedented. And it speaks to the power and durability of this A.I. craze,” notes Rosenberg Research President Dave Rosenberg. “Nvidia’s stellar results and positive guidance hammered home the point of how generative AI is proving to be transformative in every respect And while Nvidia’s valuation may be easy to justify, the S&P 500 as a whole looks pricey: It is now trading at almost 22 times forward earnings. As Essaye points out, a price-to-earnings ratio around that level was “previously only reserved for periods of quantitative easing and 0% rates, not quantitative tightening and 5.37% fed funds.” Of course, skeptics haven’t been right yet. The average year-end price target for the S&P 500 as tracked by FactSet, of 5,556, implies more than 9% upside left for the year. RBC Capital Markets has also argued that the index looks capable of supporting a valuation of 23.55 times. There is also the possibility for a near-term pullback before gains continue. [really? Is that possible??? /sarcasm] The numbers of the S&P are pretty startling to me. Kind of like when someone goes out in the basketball game and scores 60 points with 15 blocked shots. But one problem with all these algorithms, and back testing, is the past is the past. While human behavior tends to return in cycles, buying and selling of companies and technology, that hadn’t existed before is hard to be cyclical. Like I just read an article that the gardening nursery that had operated for 90 years in my home city was shutting down. It occupies 15 acres of unbelievably prime real estate, and they were using it to sell poinsettias and shrubs and trees to locals. This is to say: areas change, and businesses change and just because something operated, profitably, for 90 years doesn’t mean it’s going to operate for 100. We’ve seen the same with newspapers and magazines and comic books, and we’ve seen entire industries spring out of nothingness and become vast. Mobile games can rake in hundreds of millions of dollars. Popping virtual bubbles on a portable telephone he’s not a business model that existed when I was a kid. I doubt anyone even dreamed of it. Sooo, the S&P setting records can be alarming. Alarming if things that happened in the financial markets past need to happen or are likely to happen now. But sometimes things change sufficiently that the rules get thrown out. For all the talk of the past.com bubble, the boosters in 1999 were dead right in that the Internet changed everything. They were simply ahead by maybe five years, and things didn’t change so much that you could forgo earnings.","I think we have to understand that while it may not be entirely justified, the nature of technology has been exponential and as such we are seeing exponential gains from players and companies that are now intricately embedded within our everyday lives.That is something we have experienced before, but never on such a scale.So i'd argue companies are a lot more agile nowadays, have far more reach, insane amounts of money to dump into R&D to maintain their edge.By virtue of all this, it makes sense that we are seeing such a massive rally when compared to the last 100 years.How much of it is justified is truely up for debate, but in the end, I don't think the exponential nature of some of these behemoth corporations is a question and as such we are bound to see exponential gains.Time will tell? :)",0,0.519,0.982,POSITIVE

The original building was the Richfield headquarters in downtown Los Angeles.The building was black. Richfield was a wealthy oil company. They would merge and become Atlantic Richfield, Arco. Which in the modern era would then get bought by British petroleum and become BP Arco.But anyway, back to that black building. We had pictures of it in my building. And an old timer pointed out the gargoyles to me. There were some gold painted statues that ringed the top of the building. There was maybe 15 of them.He said that his father used to work in that black building. And before they demolished the building, they took off all those gargoyles. His father operated a giant saw to cut the busts off those gargoyles. And they were given to executives.One executive came, looked at it, said that is hideous, and left without it. So the man who was operating the saw took it home and put it in his garden. It was big. I’m guessing like the statues themselves were maybe 10-20 feet tall and the bust is kind of upper chest and above.But he said it wasn’t gold paint, it was gold. All those statues were covered in gold. That’s what an oil company in that era was like and capable of doing. They had gold statues ringing the top of the building. They wanted to show off how wealthy and successful they were.So he said that his father still had that gold plated gargoyle sitting in his garden. And he’s sure that all the neighbors just think it’s a really ugly scarecrow, but it’s gold plated concrete.",1,0.54,0.998,NEGATIVE

The S&P500 today is dominated by a few big tech stocks that have been on a big run and are richly valued - often referred to as “the Magnificent Seven”. However, when you back out those 7, the other 493 haven’t been on an incredible run and in my opinion seem relatively reasonably valued. However, investing in those stocks requires you to buy something other than market-cap weighted broad market index funds like the S&P 500.",0,0.539,0.997,NEGATIVE
