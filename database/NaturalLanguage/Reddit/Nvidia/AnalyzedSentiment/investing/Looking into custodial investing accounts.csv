,"I'm looking into starting to invest but I'm not quite sure which app to start. I've done a little bit of research and i've seen Fidelity has a Youth Account but i'm not sure if there's better ones out there. My parents don't have any accounts with any investing services like Fidelity or Vanguard so they will have to make one which they're ok with. I'm mainly looking into learning so trying out stocks like the S&P 500, NVIDIA, military depending on which way the world trends etc.. I've also been interested in a Roth 401k but I was looking into investing first. Thanks in Advance!","Any one of the big three is fine - Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard. Sentiment around here is Fidelity or Schwab for customer service.",0,0.536,0.944,POSITIVE
