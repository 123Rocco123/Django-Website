Is it just because of intelâ€™s dominance in the CPU sphere (even though anyone with a technical background knows intel isnâ€™t even close to as good as AMD in recent years)?I understand their GPUs are struggling to compete with Nvidia due to their focus on pure raster, but it baffles me that they canâ€™t get the messaging right with their marketing on CPUs for consumers. Last I checked intel still controls around 80% of that market and itâ€™s truly shocking to me because the only thing that seems to be keeping intel in competition is their own powerful marketing push from a decade ago that has essentially brainwashed the average consumer into thinking intel = supercomputer",1,0.533,NEGATIVE,1.0

Given the turmoil over at intel that will likely continue. NVDA has really graduated out of gaming gpu's there is a good opportunity for amd to take marketshare there. They are not competing with nvda in data center gpu, but they have a functional product that may be able to shave a few points of that TAM which is huge considering their market cap.
