Live off the interest of that and open a bakery or something you’ll make a little from to supplement the interest you’re gaining. At a modest 5% which you can easily get from just shoving it in a HYSA or bonds, you can make more than a doctor without any of the responsibility.Plus I don’t recommend going into a field w so much personal liability when you already have 7 million dollars that someone could steal from you in a malpractice suit.",3,0.518,NEGATIVE,1.0

Get back to me when you become a doctor.I can speak from the experience because I am one.FYI You don’t just “go to medical school”… you train for it. you build a resume for it filled with volunteering, mentorship, research participation, publications, conferences, abstracts & posters. You need to have the pre-recs for it. Unless OP was a bio or chem major they’d have to go back to undergrad. You need to have a degree from a university that has a good reputation in med schools’ view. If you went to bumblefuck university, good luck ever getting in. Take the MCAT (a 6h exam). Have a high enough science gpa and MCAT score to be competitive with people who will be able to practice longer because you gotta remember, if you start at 35 you have less “time in career” so that’s sort of a wasted seat compared to a younger, more recent grad in the face of a gigantic doctor shortage that will get worse with time.Sooo no sorry you have no clue what you’re talking about",5,0.508,NEGATIVE,1.0
