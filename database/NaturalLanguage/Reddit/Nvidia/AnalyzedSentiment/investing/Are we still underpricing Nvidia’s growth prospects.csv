With those types of margins big tech has the money, and often already have the talent, to build their own chips.

Left with an intrinsic value of $1217/shareðŸ¤¯.,"But that isnâ€™t what big companies do. Big companies donâ€™t engage in non-core expenditures. Especially to the tune of multi multi multi billions in an unbelievably competitive sphere. Why would they ever do that?Yes, every big tech company could make their own operating systems. They could make their own computers. They could make their own peripherals like keyboards and mice. But why?If youâ€™re a company that makes widgets of type a, and your really good at it, why also make widgets of type BC and D and suck at it and spend a fortune on something you have never marketed before, and never tried to sell before?Why doesnâ€™t Apple stop spending money, stocking their vending machines with Coke and Pepsi and make their own soda brand? Why donâ€™t they stop spending money on private jets and design their own private jets?weâ€™re not in the conglomerate era anymore. The last of the conglomerates are all splitting up into narrowly focused specialty divisions. Look at Dow and GE.Find what youâ€™re good at and become the best at it and blow away the competition. The news that other companies are trying to make AI is if anything, laughable. As laughable and Nvidia making smart phones and search browser engine.Theyâ€™re gonna suck at it. Theyâ€™re gonna waste enormous money on talent, hardware, R&D, and manufacturing. Theyâ€™re going to burn money at an astronomical rate to do something they suck atâ€”because they have zero history of doing it.So you can take it as a sign that Nvidia will have competition, I take it as a sign that those companies are going to waste ridiculous money on noncore expenditures that are almost certainly not going to pay off.

If you have literally any question about any facet of your computing experience, whether it's hardware or software, and you can go to Apple.Some companies are just better at certain things than others.

Because itâ€™s failed to remotely live up to the hype and theyâ€™re even trying to unravel them.Itâ€™s good in theory. Itâ€™s great if you can secure a monopoly and then just dictate terms or use one of your many arms to undercut competition, drive them under, and still be making money off your other stuff. That was probably the secret sauce of vertical integration.But when you go into an earnings report, you want to see an oil company doing so much with their gas, so much with their refining, so much with their calcined Coke, so much with their oil shale, and you donâ€™t want to see the Railroad expenses as they try and build new trains.globalization is the anti-vertical integration. Are you going to manufacture that here or are you going to manufacture it in China at 1/1000th the cost? I think we know the answer to that question. And the answer is why this stuff doesnâ€™t work. Because your competition isnâ€™t going to be wasting that same money and youâ€™re at competitive disadvantage.Can Nvidia make an iPhone clone? Yes.

The concept of vertical integration is not going away any time soon. It's also not binary. I have a company, and it is vertically integrated.

Netflix is vertically integrated by performing R&D for, producing, and releasing movies and shows themselves, which allows them to lower expenses on each step.I think you need to fix your mindset.

Theyâ€™re going to invest a ton of cash for something they canâ€™t monetize. For something thatâ€™s only gonna be used internally when they couldâ€™ve bought an off the shelf solution. Are you trying to tell me the net profits of that are going to come out overtime? I have an unbelievably difficult time seeing that.And this is simply not what companies do. You outsource your accounts payable. You outsource you human resources. You outsource your 401(k) management. Yes, you could do all that stuff internally. You could make your own financial division.Just like GM and Ford could make all their own parts and not have any suppliers whatsoever. But thereâ€™s a reason companies work like they do now. Thereâ€™s savings to be had working on your core competencies and leaving non-core to the expertsâ€” where you get the benefit of their R&D, manufacturing, talent, history.Yes, you pay for it. gasp! Just like when you buy a building and hire a construction company youâ€™ve got to pay them. Apple didnâ€™t have their own building manufacturing unit just so they could make their spiffy headquarters. They hired people with that expertise.If you think itâ€™s gonna pan out, youâ€™re certainly entitled to that opinion. I think theyâ€™re not even also rans blowing money on moonshots that arenâ€™t even hinted at coming to market. If I am an investor, I donâ€™t want them doing that.

That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64?
