,"Stock splits usually make shares more accessible because the price per share drops, but I’m wondering about the bigger picture here. While the split itself doesn’t change the market cap, could it influence Nvidia’s market value long term by bringing in more retail investors or changing how big institutions invest?",Big money doesn’t care about the split when deciding if nvidia is going to grow. Even not as big money. If I’m buying $50k of nvidia why do I care if the stock is 1000 or 100? I look at what % I think I can gain.,0,0.555,NEGATIVE,1.0

I have a friend who's not a dummy or anything, but told me he didn't want to buy shares of vgt because of its price. I was like just throw 200- 300 into it at a time, you don't need to buy whole shares, but he was averse to buying $500+ shares of anything really.",1,0.522,NEGATIVE,1.0

While the split itself doesn’t change the market cap, could it influence Nvidia’s market value long term by bringing in more retail investors or changing how big institutions invest?","I’m a huge nvidia bull. I don’t believe this will have much long-term effect whatsoever. If you can’t afford $1,000 then you were already WAAAAAAY to small to influence the stock—at all. And adding 100,000,000 more of you will STILL have no significant influence at all. None.A 3 trillion dollar company is not turning on a dime and it’s not being influenced by even 15% of retail investors working in perfect unison.When they want the stock to be in the hands of more, essentially, poor people, that’s really all you can take this as. It’s letting poor slobs own shares where they normally couldn’t.There’s nothing wrong with that. But don’t kid yourself that this has any effect at all. It gets its name in the new cycle for a couple more spins and that might be enough to move the needle some percent. Because some wealthy investors or institutional investors are flopping in when , they normally might not have.But if 100 million people buy shares who normally weren’t, it makes no difference at all. It might make a difference to them, but even that’s far-fetched. I can be a supporter of Nvidia, but having a share to isn’t going to get you any kind of financial security.",0,0.544,NEGATIVE,1.0

If there are more shares available, then more options are able to be bought and sold, thus more liquidity. Increased liquidity is always good for the stock pricing. However, I think it may fall immediately after the split bc of how many people are buying options in anticipation that it will go up upon the split",0,0.547,NEGATIVE,0.92
