Thank you!","The difference is if you do “proper research” it will show you an insanely overvalued stock that’s gone straight up 2020 meme stock levels almost based on their valuations. They’re a good company for sure but they could very easily drop to half their current price and still be a good company. I definitely get worried when I see crazy stock valuations. Doesn’t mean it can’t go up since markets can certainly be irrational for a long time, but I think it more likely over the next decade to go down than up from here. Just my own personal thoughts but when a stock is trading at these valuations you should freak out a little at signs of drops since it could be the market pricing itself back efficiently. I got downvoted for saying the same on GameStop (though nvidia is a much better business) and people told me it was amazing etc etc and a long term buy.

AMD has been playing constant catch-up for 2 decades now and hasn't succeeded.And AI is just starting.

Thank you!","I’m inclined to see it as a buying opportunity because TSMC earnings did highlight that AI is a bright light for chip demand and NVDA forecasted that AI chip demand should stay high well into 2025 if not later.The market dip seems to be from re-accelerating inflation scares. If you believe like I do that disinflation is still intact and just needs more time to show in the data and that NVDA can beat and raise on earnings, then it’s a buy.But it trades off momentum so it’s a riskier buy. It can either go down big or go up big. So all you can really do is manage your position and orient towards what best suits you. Are you in a position where you can take more risk? If not, then it’s probably a sell or hold.Edit: Watched a video on reading technicals to help me understand this. So the bursting bubble formation was the rally for a while, then it had some falling tops that broke the trend, had some signals that looked like consolidation before breaking down further. Personally, I was waiting for something like this to buy back in but wasn't sure at what price. Since broken trends tend to come back to the longer term trend line, I can see it going to $700-650-ish.But if mega-cap tech earnings this week and forward guidance suggest that AI has a long runway and that Nvidia's chips can keep up demand, then I see that a positive catalyst to get in around here. This is basically how I've been trying to manage my position. My parents are older investors so I tell them to sell when it forms those formations so they can lock in outsized gains. I'm 31 so I'm using moments like that to get in.Ultimately, my biggest worry about Nvdia is competition eating into it's first mover advantage as I'm not convinced yet it has a moat. And AI chip demand will come to a slowdown, we just don't know exactly when, so a hot momentum stock like Nvidia can fall like a rollercoaster when that happens and the market can sniff it out well in advance. Again, when you see signs of this occurring and it looks like the market is not discounting it then you trim a but to manage your exposure (unless you're really bullish on the long-term like I am - in which case you ride the bull through the major ups and downs for years).",0,0.541,NEGATIVE,1.0
