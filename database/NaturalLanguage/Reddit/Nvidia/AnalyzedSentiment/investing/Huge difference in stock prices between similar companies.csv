,"Hey all, I'm curious as to why some companies within the same sector (eg nvidia and intel) with similar market shares are priced so differently. For example, intel's share price is around $25 and it is the largest semiconductor producer worldwide. However, nvidia is rated as the 6th largest and has a share price of $236. Similarly, despite that Pfizer was as influential in producing covid vaccines as moderna, its price barely climbed while Moderna's soared. What is the explanation for these differences, and why some companies grow in share price and investor hype while others fail to? Btw this is part of my personal research for an equity research comp, TIA!",Share price is based on the number of shares issued and the amount of the company that is publicly traded. Instead look at market cap.,0,0.596,1.0,NEGATIVE

If the other has 100 shares of ownership then each share is worth $5. Both are effectively the same, one is just a pie broken up into more pieces.Now if one of those stands is on a residential road that consistently makes $20/day then it would be relatively stable in price. But if the other one was set up in the parking lot of a football stadium then some days it might make $0 and other days might make $100's. If that team has a bad season with less fans then it might make less on its good days. That unpredictability leads to volatility as markets try to guess what it's worth with constantly changing results and expectations",0,0.523,1.0,NEGATIVE

Btw this is part of my personal research for an equity research comp, TIA!","Hey hydrogen, I can give some color on the $PFE and $MRNA examples:Firstly, I would focus on market cap instead of actual share price as that will give you a better idea of the company’s actual value. Market cap is simply share price x # of shares.Pfizer is a $230B+ market cap company that does dozens of billions of dollars in revenue each year. These revenues come from dozens of different drugs and products. Its market cap typically trades at a multiple of expected future sales and the multiple used for different companies is typical dependent on how much revenue and ebitda growth you can expect from the company. For example, a company growing revenues by 20% year over year will trade at a higher multiple than one that grows at 4% yoy. Because Pfizer is so big, the revenues it generated from the COVID vaccine were very substantial but recognized by investors as temporary growth. The companys shares are now struggling with the fact that growth down as COVID vaccine revenues fade.Moderna prior to the pandemic, however, was a biotech company with no commercial products that went from a preclinical potential technology to generating billions of dollars in revenue. It’s market cap reflected that drastic change and sky rocketed. The price has since come in as investors try to figure out what their longer term growth profile will look like.I hope that’s helpful.Source: do this for work",0,0.575,0.999,NEGATIVE

Basically some companies are split more ways than others the stock price is essentially the market cap value of the company divided by how many shares there are.The bigger a company is the harder it is to move up or down in general. If you look into technical analysis basically more support and resistance and stronger also more points for the stock to catch or barriers to breakout from. Average volume is also probably relevant,0,0.588,0.613,NEGATIVE

Intel is a legacy company with a huge infrastructure focused on making chips for PCs and laptops. NVIDIA has a completely different production emphasis focused around gaming chips that are also used in crypto mining. The chips of each company cannot be substituted for the other's.You are oversimplifying and thereby missing key information about companies when you assume they are somehow equivalent just because they are in the same industry. That is never true. GM and Tesla have almost nothing in common, despite the fact they both build cars.
