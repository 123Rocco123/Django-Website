A retirement account is meant to be for retirement, not for withdrawals. Sure, you can be high risk in any account's holdings. The concept of the investment diversity should match your time frame. Some riskier holdings for higher payout might be reasonable in a retirement account because there is no intent to need the funds soon or on short notice. Funds you might need soon (3-5 years) or on short notice are not funds you keep in a retirement account. That's not liquidity. But also, there are no capital gains or losses, no interest or dividends in retirement accounts. All earnings here are considered Ordinary income. ",0,0.518,NEGATIVE,1.0
