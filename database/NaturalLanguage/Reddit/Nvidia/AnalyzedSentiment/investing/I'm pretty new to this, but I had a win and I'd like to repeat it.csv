If you like the fund because of the 20%+ NVDA holding then take a look at SMH. Very similar etf with about the same percentage of NVDA and about half the expense ratio at .35%",2,0.507,NEGATIVE,0.999

You still want to do your due diligence because there is always the possibility they are being paid to push the stock but that would be a good place find out about up and comers. But no you can’t predict it again otherwise you’d be the richest person in the world. As far as selling other holding that up to you and your financial situation and the type of account but the best advice I was always given was when you get greedy is when you lose it all. That isn’t a for sure thing but just do you research and make an informed decision on what you think the future could hold.,0,0.524,POSITIVE,0.889

Some people are all about Motley Fool and I believe they have a free option as well but I’ve heard not so good things about their advice. You can probably even google Stock Market news or Financial news. Yahoo Finance is a good place to start as well. If you link your brokerage account to them it will show you news specific to the stocks/funds you hold but they also have a basic news page as well that could be a good starting point,2,0.546,NEGATIVE,0.999

Some reports came out and I ended up losing three grand. Also, depending on how many shares you own, if you’re looking to generate income, while also potentially having growth, you could look at cover calls as well",4,0.537,NEGATIVE,1.0

Is there a way to get info on rising companies that's not scouring reddit posts and TikToks?",I think statistics do play a part in investing and you can look at historical trends but the stats you want to look at are more the P/E ratio or the Beta or other asset specific numbers.A covered call is a little difficult to explain but basically say you own 100 shares of XYZ Corp and you bought them at $30/share. Based on your research you don’t think the price will move much over the specific period of time you are looking at you can sell a call option at a specific strike price say $35. You’ll get a premium for selling the option. If at the expiration date the stock is below $35 the option will expire worthless and you’ll have made the premium. But if the stock finishes above the $35 strike price you are required to sell the $100 shares you own at the strike price. So in this case you’d have made $5/share plus the option premium. But say some news broke and the stock skyrocketed to $70. You sold at a strike price of $35 so when option is exercised you will only make the $35/share. That’s a very high level overview. Do your research but if done right you can make decent money but if dont wrong you have limited realized losses but you can loose also. You also have to have an options approved account which you’d have to talk to your brokerage firm about.,6,0.535,NEGATIVE,1.0

Is there a way to get info on rising companies that's not scouring reddit posts and TikToks?","So this particular stock buy is in a brokerage, and in that I also just have Fidelity's pick of the S&P. About two years ago I put money into it and unfortunately that's the only time I had a surplus of funds to put in there until now.I also have a Roth IRA that I've had for a while that I just do a percentage of the same Fidelity S&P, a Fidelity International mixing pot and then a small portion of that account is a money market. I ditched the bond aspect of that account last year because it didn't make sense to me to keep it. Not sure if that was the right move or not, but my high yield savings had better output than that. I feel good with those two picks, once maybe I have 100k in there then I'll look at buying different funds? Also not sure if that's ""the move"" I've just read it a few times so I don't think until I have a decent amount in there the diversification isn't worth it.I'm trying more so to learn in the brokerage and be safer with the retirement.",1,0.549,NEGATIVE,1.0

Is there a way to get info on rising companies that's not scouring reddit posts and TikToks?","Taking a small portion of your investments outside of retirement to make trades is fine. Not doing so and strictly using index investing is also fine.Growing investments ONLY in IRA/401k accounts is, imo, NOT fine. You need both taxable accounts and retirement accounts growing aggressively. More of the latter. The taxed account gives you flexibility when big purchases come up.As far as your chip index holding, congrats! I'd recommend taking out 33-50%, so you're able to stay that the money you left in it is ""house money"", namely you took out your initial investment. You'll pay tax on those gains, 20% CG tax at most (assuming they're held over a year, full income tax if less). Set that aside, maybe adjust your withholding by enough that the rest of your paychecks this year will pay off this tax with the additional federal withholding you add.",2,0.528,NEGATIVE,1.0
