,"Currently have an IRA, savings and emergency fund. Since my disability is not earned income was thinking of buying a few shares of quality value/growth stocks, was wondering if Nvidia with the up coming 10 to 1 split might be a good place to start with a few shares, all thoughts/ suggestions are appreciated.","Others might disagree, i don't LOVE Nvidia right now. That means it'll probably keep going up a lot though lol. How long do you plan to keep this money invested? Maybe just go with QQQM? It provides more diversity but it's primarily tech. 8% of it is Nvidia.",0,0.527,NEGATIVE,0.999

Generally safer than buying individual stocks. You really have to follow news on individual stocks and know when it's time to get out. If you must choose an individual stock, NVDA is a pretty good one right now.",0,0.558,POSITIVE,0.985

If you are investing, not trading it’s a company that I would definitely have in my portfolio. There is a lot of noise around the stock now and people trying to make money off that. That may cause some short term dips and I’ll use any that may come as buying opportunities. I think it will continue to outperform over time.",0,0.55,NEGATIVE,0.982
