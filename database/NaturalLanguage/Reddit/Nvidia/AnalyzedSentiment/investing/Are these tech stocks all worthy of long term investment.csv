ASML 2.) Taiwan semi conductor 3.) NVIDIA 4.) SYNOPSYS 5.) ADOBE","You need to do you own research, but I will give you my brief opinion.ASML is a monopoly essentially that sells the machine needed for semiconductor design etching. Very good companies, but a little pricey on the valuation.TSM is a near monopoly because it fabricates the most advanced semiconductor chips in the world. Seems to be either undervalued or at least fair value imo.NVDA is a great company and has a near monopoly in consumer and server GPUs. Probably the most risky of the semiconductor stocks though since its valuation is predicated on AI software growth. Overvalued imo.I don’t know the rest. I’m only a semiconductors analyst.",0,0.54,0.998,NEGATIVE

ASML 2.) Taiwan semi conductor 3.) NVIDIA 4.) SYNOPSYS 5.) ADOBE","Micron seems more cyclical growth than secular growth compared to the other semiconductors. Seems like a stock to swing trade. I would own it before the semiconductor boom cycle begins and sell it before the semiconductor boom cycle ends.DRAM and memory and storage in general are an important part of computing, but not quite as value added as being a designer of CPUs, GPUs, or any other integrated circuits imo.",2,0.535,0.639,NEGATIVE

ASML 2.) Taiwan semi conductor 3.) NVIDIA 4.) SYNOPSYS 5.) ADOBE","I like semis a lot right now so I’ll give you my 2 cents. ASML is a fantastic company that is a monopoly in their industry. If you don’t know what I mean by that research what they do. It’ll grow for years to come, however that is priced in and the stock is expensive.I love TSM, I started a position this month which I plan on adding to over the next year.NVIDIA I think is trading expensive right now, but Wall Street loves this stock.

These are clearly good longterm investments.TSM is going to be industry leader for at least awhile. Not as good as the above two but a sensible longterm investment.
