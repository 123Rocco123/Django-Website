,"Almost half my net worth is in Microsoft and I also have a somewhat large position in Nvidia. Obviously both got hammered this year, especially NVDA which lost half its value. I wasn't holding onto these stocks for any good reason (MSFT is my employer and I just never bothered to sell vested shares, and I bought NVDA on a whim because of the hype). Going forward, I plan to shift everything into index funds. But would it be a bad idea to sell off everything right now given how much they are down? Reluctant to do that because that would lock in huge losses when these two stocks will probably recover in the long run. Not sure if that idea is rational though. What would be the correct move here?",I would hold but stop adding more and move to be more diversified. The time to sell was last year. If you don’t need the money for some time 5+ years ride it out. MSFT APPL and GOOGL will be fine,0,0.556,0.99,NEGATIVE

My suggestion would be to hold those two stocks for the next 20 years but put your future earnings into S&P500 index fund.",0,0.558,0.655,POSITIVE
,"Almost half my net worth is in Microsoft and I also have a somewhat large position in Nvidia. Obviously both got hammered this year, especially NVDA which lost half its value. I wasn't holding onto these stocks for any good reason (MSFT is my employer and I just never bothered to sell vested shares, and I bought NVDA on a whim because of the hype). Going forward, I plan to shift everything into index funds. But would it be a bad idea to sell off everything right now given how much they are down?

What would be the correct move here?","I wouldn't plan on selling Microsoft outright, but if you do I would recommend still holding some. I'm biased though b/c I also own some MSFT and think it has a solid future long-term. NVDA is probably fine to hold onto but I haven't done research on them so I can't say.Half your net worth in one company seems a lot but Microsoft is a good one if you decided to hold on for a while. I would recommend setting a plan to diversify, which it seems you have wanting to move to indexing. Depending on your cost basis of MSFT, it could be up for you so it might not be a bad time to start reducing that exposure to other securities and asset classes. As it seems like you sit on things and don't day trade, broad-based ETFs with low expense ratios might be a good idea for you.Something to think about is something Warren Buffett likes to tout, which is to focus your portfolio on about 20-30 stocks/securities. This would suggest each company held would occupy roughly 3-5% of the portfolio on average. Obviously, that will fluctuate but I would keep any individual holding under 12-15% for a balanced portfolio, which even that's pretty high.",0,0.541,1.0,NEGATIVE

I’d say you should tax loss harvest your NVDA and hold MSFT because I presume you’ve been DCA’ed in with your employer sponsored shares over the years they vested.
