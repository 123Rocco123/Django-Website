It’s more than just the ‘Magnificent Seven.’ This euphoria seems to be lifting up all of the sectors and a majority of the industries and stocks.” The rally may have been sparked by Nvidia's blowout earnings on Wednesday, but it spread well beyond the AI behemoth.

The S&P 500 managed to clinch its 13th record close of 2024 “It’s like a rising tide lifts all boats. There is more participation in this advance. It’s more than just the ‘Magnificent Seven.’ This euphoria seems to be lifting up all of the sectors and a majority of the industries and stocks.” The rally may have been sparked by Nvidia's blowout earnings on Wednesday, but it spread well beyond the AI behemoth. Three sectors hit new highs this past week—tech, healthcare, and industrials. Financials and materials are less than 5% away from their peaks. Costco Wholesale, which sells more corn chips than microchips, is at a record too. S&P 500 Sector Gain during week ended Feb. 23 Consumer Staples 2.1% Information Technology 2% Materials 1.9% Industrials 1.8% Financials 1.6% Consumer Discretionary 1.54% Health Care 1.51% Communication Services 1.49% Utilities 1.2% Real Estate 0.9% Energy 0.4% Most of the market’s 25% gain since late October was premised on the idea that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates starting in March—or May at the very latest. Recent comments from members of the Fed, along with signs of persistent inflation, suggest that the first cut could come in June or even later. Hopes for as many as seven rate cuts this year have faded away. At some point, rate cuts will matter again. The percentage of S&P 500 constituents trading above their 50-day moving average climbed to more than 67% on Friday, according to Dow Jones Market Data. While that’s still well below the high of 91% reached on Jan. 2, it’s a notable improvement from the lowest level of the year, which was just shy of 51% on Feb. 13 That’s a lot of movement in only a few months of this year. So bubble, shmubble, there is volatility for sure.","If you don’t like it, down vote. Or don’t read it. I’m lifting content from MarketWatch.

I swear by all that is holy and unholy, I don’t give a flying fuck about karma. To repeat: I’m in the hospital. Every post I’ve made in this forum has been with me in the hospital.

There is no shortage of people on this forum calling AI nonsense. Calling AI bubble. However, just looked at the table to show the gains for one week of the S&P categories.Almost everything is 1.5% or more. So it’s not an AI bubble. It’s an everything bubble.EDIT: whoops, got cut off by people changing my bandages.Basically we’re in a bull market. And I feel people are clamoring, clawing, cheering for AI to take a nosedive and prove… I don’t know. Prove themselves right or everyone else wrong. But the fact the entire market was hinging on Nvidia’s earning call shows how connected all this is.There is almost no sector that is not tied to the bull market. And if it’s a bubble or not I can’t say. But it’s raising everything. And if you’re sitting in VTI, VOO, and a bucket of gold, you’re still affected.So all the people cheering for a fall are going to take a hit, regardless of whether or not they have shares of SMCI et al or not.That’s all I was trying to show.",3,0.523,0.999,NEGATIVE
