It’s fun to be right and more fun to be right in good company. But what if everyone is wrong? Isn’t it this type of mania and exuberance that should give the market pause? Nvidia has effectively grown to more than 98% of the market for data-center graphics processing units, or GPUs, due to a complete lack of meaningful competition. This early lead has given the company unbounded pricing power, driving its margins in the most recent quarter to over 76%. over the past few months we have seen signs of competition entering the market. This will affect Nvidia’s margins and the company’s ability to continue to grow at such a staggering rate. the competition is coming from an array of places [in addition to AMD who is predicting $4B for their new GPU] that include a number of Nvidia’s largest and most important customers. For example, Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS cloud has its AI chips for training and inference, Microsoft recently announced its Maia AI chip, and Alphabet Inc.’s Google continues to innovate on its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Oracle Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. are also developing AI chips in house. not as much an indictment on Nvidia as they are a realization by these companies that overdependence on a single source for AI semiconductors is a risk In short, competition is real and it is coming to Nvidia in a meaningful way. More competition pressures Nvidia’s pricing, margins and market share, as well as its rates of revenue and EPS growth.","As a Nvidia bear at this price, although I’m holding my long time shares, I believe Nvidia has three main strengths to hold back competition and three weaknesses to its pricing power long term.CUDA (software & support).Best performance even excluding CUDA.First mover advantage (biggest network, most capital).Weaknesses I believe are getting bigger although the rate at which they are may not matter in an AI world assuming AI turns out to be the new iPhone or internet.High margins inspire competition (AMD, Intel, Huawei).High exposure to capital rich buyers (vertical alternatives like TPU and Maia).High risk of shift from LLM training to LLM inference as model training scale diminishes in improvement (lowering need for full replacement of prior generation with cutting edge hardware).I’d place high exposure to capital rich buyers as the primary concern for Nvidia’s long term pricing power. Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon, Oracle. All are the biggest buyers and have decent SOC design teams. They can quite literally spend 90% of an H100 on an alternative and still save 2-3% since the margin is currently 93% on H100. $38.5k is Nvidia margin.That means the incentive to make an alternative ASIC AI accelerator is huge. And they exist. More so, inference is what we do once we finish training an LLM. And inference tends to perform reasonably well in price/performance on non-peak hardware. You need the latest greatest Blackwell 100 for training GPT5 and Gemini 2. Do you need it to inference with efficient 7b versions of them?",0,0.531,0.969,POSITIVE

They also mentioned that they can tailor any custom chips they make to their own topology and needs. Sounds good.However, companies outsource non-core components and services all the time. Is Microsoft going to have their own janitorial staff or are they gonna just hire some firm to trim the hedges, wash the windows, and empty the trash?It was all the rage, many decades ago, to be some perfectly integrated, vertical conglomerate. Like general electric. What is General Electrics core components and products? Hell if I know. Orientation for new hires must take a month.And companies can get dinged for going on tangents. Amazon was beaten up for a while when they started AWS. Google was punished for their whimsical and very expensive moonshots. Investors like focus, and not to have their money wasted. Hell, they want you to spin off any divisions that stray too far. If you can make it a success, quickly, you’ll be rewarded. But most cases you’re starting the race in the back.Auto makers have a plethora, an army, of auto suppliers. Every iPhone is pulling in parts from across the world. It’s a global economy, and that has helped us tremendously. With admittedly, some hiccups.But this just seems like such an expensive non-core, non-foundational category to try and compete in. Not to mention your competing with the literal expert at it who might even take it out on you, in a monopolistic fashion.and the also rans aren’t gonna have the benefit of scale. If you’re just making chips for yourself, those are gonna be some expensive chips. Because you still have the same R&D cost, admittedly, lower manufacturing cost cause you don’t need 1 million warehouses and assembly plants. But your per unit cost is still going to be way higher than nvidia.Is META going to start making its own ram and hard disks? Build their own brand of jet to shuttle around execs? I think we would shake our heads if we heard they were trying.It’s one thing to have Bing search engine. Or competing Mail platforms. But the huge difference in those is this is manufacturing. This is bricks and mortar and a lot, a lot of money. Like if Apple makes a car now. Just one car that would be gigantic undertaking and super expensive. For a non-fundamental manufacturing item where theyd have enormous strategic disadvantages.A caveat to all this is maybe I’m reading this wrong. And AI GPUs are core, foundational products for ALL these gigantic, disparate companies. If that is the case, then the AI bubble is just started. It’s not in its infancy, it’s not even pregnant yet.So this is some bad news for Nvidia, but as I just stated, this is a massive doubling, tripling, quadrupling down on AI. By the biggest most profitable companies on earth.And that is very good news for nvidia.",1,0.527,1.0,NEGATIVE

But when you build an EV, the battery can make up more than 30 % of the manufacturing cost, basically replacing all the value car makers used to create through the drivetrain. Once you go all in on EVs, you want to at least have a part in the battery production chain because it is such a central part of your product. That's why companies like VW are starting to build their own battery plants, usually in joint ventures.I would say in the same way, 10 years ago chip manufacturing was not as central to the business of Google/Microsoft/AWS. But once you go all in on AI, spend 20-30 billion every year on one supplier who cashes in a 70%+ margin, it sure does seem pretty central to your business. However the semiconductor manufacturing chain seems a lot more complicated to get into compared to batteries, will be exciting to see how that plays out.",2,0.546,0.922,NEGATIVE

It requires a LOT of very different and sophisticated engineering profiles. Those people don’t come for cheap. Moreover, the software tools used for the process are all sold by a duopoly of Cadence and Synopsys and are also extremely expensive. To add to the mix, it is VERY different to design something by improving on existing versions, than to take a blank peace of paper and do it from scratch. So know-how indeed is your moat, and it is a huge one. All the companies you mentioned are software companies with very little hardware know-how, who are used to much shorter product cycles and faster times to market. If software design is a sprint, hardware design is a marathon. It’s a whole different sport. Can they do it? Maybe… But it’s gonna take hell of a lot more than just to “hire some designers and knock on TSMC’s door.",4,0.524,1.0,NEGATIVE

It’s fun to be right and more fun to be right in good company. But what if everyone is wrong? Isn’t it this type of mania and exuberance that should give the market pause? Nvidia has effectively grown to more than 98% of the market for data-center graphics processing units, or GPUs, due to a complete lack of meaningful competition. This early lead has given the company unbounded pricing power, driving its margins in the most recent quarter to over 76%. over the past few months we have seen signs of competition entering the market. This will affect Nvidia’s margins and the company’s ability to continue to grow at such a staggering rate. the competition is coming from an array of places [in addition to AMD who is predicting $4B for their new GPU] that include a number of Nvidia’s largest and most important customers. For example, Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS cloud has its AI chips for training and inference, Microsoft recently announced its Maia AI chip, and Alphabet Inc.’s Google continues to innovate on its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Oracle Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. are also developing AI chips in house. not as much an indictment on Nvidia as they are a realization by these companies that overdependence on a single source for AI semiconductors is a risk In short, competition is real and it is coming to Nvidia in a meaningful way. More competition pressures Nvidia’s pricing, margins and market share, as well as its rates of revenue and EPS growth.","Of course I know they are a chip designer, that doesn't make it any easier though. I am sorry but it's a bit funny to say their value ""just comes from their intellectual property"" when NVIDIA has one of the strongest technological moats in the world right now. Do you think they could achieve a 70%+ margin on $60 billion of hardware revenue if anyone could do it? They have been optimizing their whole tech stack for like 15 years, simply getting people to switch away from CUDA will be very though. Apart from the hundreds of little things, for example integrating those GPUs in the datacenters or all of their supplier relationships.Somebody will probably get competetive with them at some point, but I think completely new architectures like Cerebras or Groq are looking more promising right now than any of the tech giants.

To me it's a lot more than predicting next word, even though that's what it does.Here is reply to your comment from ChatGPT""You raise some important considerations regarding the capabilities and limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) like the one you're discussing. The current state of LLMs does indeed revolve around predicting the next word in a given text sequence, which is fundamentally different from human-like thinking or reasoning. This approach can lead to what is often referred to as ""hallucinations"" or the generation of plausible but factually incorrect information.Your skepticism about LLMs evolving into Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is shared by many in the AI research community. AGI refers to a hypothetical AI that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply intelligence across a broad range of tasks and domains, similar to the cognitive abilities of a human being. As of now, LLMs, including the most advanced ones, do not demonstrate this level of understanding or reasoning. They operate based on patterns learned from their training data and lack consciousness, intentionality, or genuine comprehension.The comparison to a more advanced search engine is apt in many ways. LLMs excel at processing and generating language based on a vast corpus of text data, making them more interactive and versatile than traditional search engines. However, they still fundamentally rely on the data they've been trained on and thus, can reflect the limitations and biases present in that data.In summary, while LLMs represent a significant leap in natural language processing and AI, they are not on the verge of becoming AGI. They are sophisticated tools that can mimic certain aspects of human-like text generation but lack the broader, deeper understanding and adaptability that AGI would entail. The path to AGI, if it is indeed achievable, is likely to require fundamental breakthroughs beyond the pattern recognition and prediction capabilities of current LLMs.""",3,0.517,1.0,NEGATIVE

Nvidia has effectively grown to more than 98% of the market for data-center graphics processing units, or GPUs, due to a complete lack of meaningful competition.

For example, Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS cloud has its AI chips for training and inference, Microsoft recently announced its Maia AI chip, and Alphabet Inc.’s Google continues to innovate on its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Oracle Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. are also developing AI chips in house. not as much an indictment on Nvidia as they are a realization by these companies that overdependence on a single source for AI semiconductors is a risk In short, competition is real and it is coming to Nvidia in a meaningful way.

Let me correct a couple things that people are saying here because it's not a great understanding from what I read.Inference for example. BTW this is Dan Nathan's new bear highlight he wants to grab onto.Inference is when you consume a trained model. But there are variability of trained models that need different levels of accelerated compute in order to give them the best consumption capabilities.In short, larger, more complex, foundational models need more advanced accelerated compute.Let me put this in perspective. Currently, you can't run the largest and best model from gpt4 turbo in real time. There is latency and delay that would prohibit you from creating let's say a full on real time chatbot phone conversation type experience. You could do it with nlp only and other methodologies but not directly utilizing gpt4 turbo.As well, I assure you gpt4 turbo is running on nvidia for inference.Another thing to keep in mind. Most businesses running gpt4 are doing so on a shared server to better handle costs. This is called pay as you go. Now, pay attention because this is wild, do you know how much it costs to get a dedicated server of gpt?I don't know if the price sheet is public so I'm just going to say. A lot. A whole lot of money. It's jaw dropping. Point is, it's runijng on nvidias best chips. Period there's no doubt.So when you consider inference you have to understand there are varying levels to this.Maybe a dev team wants a fine tuned Opensource model and if course that can run on cheaper hardware. These are the chips microsift are building inference for. Not for gpt greatest and latest but smaller more efficient models.To me, the question is this. Very very simple.Is gpt able to release models best in class (foundational) in real time? Instant. No latency. 0 latency.If the can achieve that then it means compute has caught up with capability. At that moment you can begin to question competition and Nvidia.Until that happens meaningfully Nvidia is King 👑SORA (3d generation) just adds to this problem in favor of Nvidia 1000x fold. Maybe 10000000x fold.With SORA it maybe that we never catch up to compute meaningfully with model capability.Maybe quantum I don't even know.Think of it like this. Everytime Nvidia releases a gaming card do you think that that game runs now perfect 8k ultra high settings? No. And the new games that come out only further pressure the cards capabilities. Just look at cyber punk 2070 for reference. Look at GTA6 when it comes out. It will put pressure on that card. And the cycle of higher, further, faster, better, more continues.AI is the same thing here.It's a MOAT sorry. Until quantum it's a moat.Sorry guys.

Sure, Nvidia could say they’re making a consumer operating system for pcs and phones.And it wouldn’t be impossible.

And the times we don’t have it in a category, things go very wrong.But you gotta pick your battles. I predict they burn through a gargantuan amount of money and end up relying on Nvidia. If Nvidia cuts the prices, even for a sweetheart deal with one of these competitors, it takes the gas out of trying to find a way to beat them.They could run afoul of antitrust going too much like that, but those cases take years and years to sort out",1,0.524,1.0,NEGATIVE

To your first point about equivalent moats, in the case of Apple vs Intel there's really no way Intel was going to be successful making inroads on Apple's ecosystem, and I'm also not so sure NVDA would have a lot of luck battling MSFT on it's home turf between MSFT's enterprise software business, Azure, etc. For example, Google had a cloud advantage on MSFT before Azure's strong enterprise integration (and Google's lack of enterprise focus) allowed Azure to zoom past GCP. Cracking that enterprise nut is tough just like Apple's consumer ecosystem.One nuance being that Apple wasn't trying to compete with Intel's core business and sell chips globally as a chip supplier, they saw a strategic advantage in designing and producing chips for their own products. MSFT may actually view this the same way with respect to Azure/AI as core to their future enterprise business and it's very risky from a corporate strategy perspective for your core business (or a big chunk of that core business) to be dependent on a sole supplier.So for me it's not a matter of ""if"" it's a matter of ""when"" and to be clear I'm not suggesting MSFT will compete with NVDA as a supplier to the globe, but I would expect companies who see their future reliant on AI-related compute to DIY as a way to mitigate risk and reduce cost in the long term.",2,0.548,1.0,NEGATIVE
