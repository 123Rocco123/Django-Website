Invest individually in companies in sectors I actually know a ton about. I can do enough QA and understand how that particular industry works to make educated investments and it has served me very well. I also use indexes as my main crutch.Do I think most people should do what I do? Nah. Do I think not everyone has to follow the same repeated advice nah. Comes down to being real with yourself. Most folks won't do the actual work and won't beat the market and thus should go for proper indexes. Fine to throw probably 5% into some invidual funds in likely most cases though. I'd probably do a mock up first though and only do what you can actually afford.,3,0.53,POSITIVE,0.987
