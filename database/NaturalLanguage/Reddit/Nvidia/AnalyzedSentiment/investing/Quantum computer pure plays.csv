,"I'm doing research on the quantum computing industry. I know there's several big names getting a piece of it. Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, Honeywell... What are the options for quantum computing pure plays? If I just want a piece of quantum and nothing else, what am I looking at? IonQ, QCi, Rigetti, Arquitt... are there any I'm missing?","It is hard to find pure plays. It is a very expensive endeavor.QBTS is an interesting company. They have been burning through capital for years, but they do have a product.",0,0.574,0.666,POSITIVE

IonQ, QCi, Rigetti, Arquitt... are there any I'm missing?","Quantum computing will either be broken by a big, public company like Microsoft or a small, private company which uses private investors. That private company will be bought at a high price by a. If company for the IP at great profit for the investors.So if I were you I would continue to bet on the big tech, Microsoft, Google, and IBM. All of these have actual strides in delivering quantum computing because they have the research capital. You may add Amazon but they are not at the same level yet as the other three.",0,0.59,0.62,NEGATIVE

I don't know enough about their IP though.I think the stock is subject to wsb type buying and selling, so it's been volatile, but at the least it's meant some good buying opportunities for longer term plays.",2,0.532,0.64,POSITIVE
