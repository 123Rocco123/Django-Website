,"*2024 sorry ahahFirst time posting here, hello everyone, what do y'all think of my portfolio: 23,32% on Carl Zeiss (AFXG) will probaly lower it and redistribute it after good returns 13,60% on Infineon (IFXGn) 12,75% on NVIDIA 11,95% on DAL 8,89% on AAL 8,47% on ASML 6,67% on STMicro 6,18% on UAL 5,08% on AIR (soon to be increased) 3,02% on RR (soon to be increased) Airlines are the odd one out, i'm betting on them longterm as the air market and oil prices are becoming more favorable, I'm investing fairly long term on all these positions and i was planning to further diversify it, I'm based in Italy so USD/EUR exchange and GBP/EUR exchange are also at play.What do y'all think? hope it might given y'all some interesting investment ideas","NVIDIA has grown so much that I would be scared to keep 12% of my portfolio there. It is def massively overvalued due to AI hype, I would take profits there nowI would personally diversify with some natural resources producer that pays dividend (one of oil giants or gold giants?). Gold companies like Barrick have production AISC of ~1200$ per ounce and are now selling it for ATH 2050$ which means they make a good money. Def Good times for them. Buffet team gets into Oil a lot with purchasing Occidental, and the companies are now very cheap. For example Exxon Mobil - (Price/Earnings 9, Price/Sales 1.20 and it has 30B of cash.... with 40B of debt only).",0,0.537,POSITIVE,0.98

Infineon and STM would be slightly risky as they are both heavily weighted towards automotive semis and the sentiment there is absolutely shit. Really good companies though!,0,0.517,NEGATIVE,0.941
