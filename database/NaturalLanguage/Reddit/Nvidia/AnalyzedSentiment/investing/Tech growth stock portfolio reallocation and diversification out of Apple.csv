,"I'm looking to create a portfolio with relatively safe tech growth stocks. I know that sounds like a bit of an oxymoron, but I'm looking to diversify out of my AAPL position. 77% of my portfolio is in the s&p 500. The rest is in AAPL. I don't think AAPL is going anywhere, and they obviously have a loyal customer base and I think Apple TV is putting out some great content. I also love how vertically integrated they are. That being said, I think they've reached market saturation in most areas and it seems the pace of innovation has slowed. I'm thinking about selling 50%+ of my AAPL position because over the years it has grown to represent 23% of my portfolio and that just seems like too much for any one individual stock. I'm considering divesting and reallocating into the following positions: GOOGL MSFT AMZN TSM NVDA META TSLA Google needs no introduction, but the stock is at super low p/e ratios and they continuously try (mostly unsuccessfully) to innovate across multiple sectors. Ads are obviously the bread and butter, but YouTube is the biggest threat to cable and streaming services. YouTube content is vast, high quality, and free! Microsoft is also at pretty low p/e ratios. Azure is #2 cloud service. Gaming sector is growing and Sony/PlayStation is falling behind. Biggest thing for me is their investment into AI tech such as OpenAI (aka chatGPT). Overall they have diverse revenue streams and continue to innovate. Amazon is not just ecommerce, but at absolute logistics giant. #1 cloud service. Decent streaming service. And they continuously reinvest into the company. They're also down more than others on this list in the past year. Taiwanese Semiconductor is the world's leading chip manufacturer. P/e is low, but partly because of inflated chip prices. Biggest fear is Chinese government interference, but the $40 billion investment into the Arizona factory is encouraging. Nvidia makes the most powerful chips in the world and has great partnerships with other leaders in tech. Also one of the leaders in AI technology. Downside is sky high p/e and it's down the least over the last year, so not the best value. META for me is the hardest to evaluate. On one hand Facebook and Instagram are absolute social media giants that print money, but on the other hand I don't see nearly as much potential for growth. VR technology is cool, but it's a long way away from being mainstream. If that ever happens, there's no guarantee that META will be the ones to do it. Tesla has obviously been hammered the most on this list, but I'm not sure it's totally warranted. Whatever Musk is doing at Twitter shouldn't really affect Tesla as much as it has. P/e ratio is back to reality somewhat and they continue to lead ev sales. Other manufacturers are struggling to catch up, it's happening, but much slower than anyone expected. If Tesla continues to keep it's foot on the gas and continues to improve it's qc and manufacturing processes, I see them remaining a leader in the ev field for years to come. So Reddit, what do you think of my choices? And are there any other companies you think I missed and should look into? What percentage would you allocate into the above companies?","Just because something is “giant” or “most powerful” or “innovative” doesn’t mean the shares of that company will provide superior returns, or any returns at all, for decades to come. The best performing stock of the past 50 years is Altria, the cigarette company. Let me say that again, the best performing stock of the last 50 years is part of a dying industry that has been around for hundreds of years.",0,0.586,POSITIVE,0.525

,"I'm looking to create a portfolio with relatively safe tech growth stocks. I know that sounds like a bit of an oxymoron, but I'm looking to diversify out of my AAPL position. 77% of my portfolio is in the s&p 500. The rest is in AAPL. I don't think AAPL is going anywhere, and they obviously have a loyal customer base and I think Apple TV is putting out some great content. I also love how vertically integrated they are. That being said, I think they've reached market saturation in most areas and it seems the pace of innovation has slowed. I'm thinking about selling 50%+ of my AAPL position because over the years it has grown to represent 23% of my portfolio and that just seems like too much for any one individual stock. I'm considering divesting and reallocating into the following positions: GOOGL MSFT AMZN TSM NVDA META TSLA Google needs no introduction, but the stock is at super low p/e ratios and they continuously try (mostly unsuccessfully) to innovate across multiple sectors. Ads are obviously the bread and butter, but YouTube is the biggest threat to cable and streaming services. YouTube content is vast, high quality, and free! Microsoft is also at pretty low p/e ratios. Azure is #2 cloud service. Gaming sector is growing and Sony/PlayStation is falling behind. Biggest thing for me is their investment into AI tech such as OpenAI (aka chatGPT). Overall they have diverse revenue streams and continue to innovate. Amazon is not just ecommerce, but at absolute logistics giant. #1 cloud service. Decent streaming service. And they continuously reinvest into the company. They're also down more than others on this list in the past year. Taiwanese Semiconductor is the world's leading chip manufacturer. P/e is low, but partly because of inflated chip prices. Biggest fear is Chinese government interference, but the $40 billion investment into the Arizona factory is encouraging. Nvidia makes the most powerful chips in the world and has great partnerships with other leaders in tech. Also one of the leaders in AI technology. Downside is sky high p/e and it's down the least over the last year, so not the best value. META for me is the hardest to evaluate. On one hand Facebook and Instagram are absolute social media giants that print money, but on the other hand I don't see nearly as much potential for growth. VR technology is cool, but it's a long way away from being mainstream. If that ever happens, there's no guarantee that META will be the ones to do it. Tesla has obviously been hammered the most on this list, but I'm not sure it's totally warranted. Whatever Musk is doing at Twitter shouldn't really affect Tesla as much as it has. P/e ratio is back to reality somewhat and they continue to lead ev sales. Other manufacturers are struggling to catch up, it's happening, but much slower than anyone expected. If Tesla continues to keep it's foot on the gas and continues to improve it's qc and manufacturing processes, I see them remaining a leader in the ev field for years to come. So Reddit, what do you think of my choices? And are there any other companies you think I missed and should look into? What percentage would you allocate into the above companies?","I ended up selling 1/3 of the apple position and putting half into qqq and the other half split between Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Taiwanese semiconductor.",1,0.501,NEGATIVE,1.0
