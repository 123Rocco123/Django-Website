,"I get it that solar panels use semiconductors, so they are technically makers of semiconductor products. But their end result is producing energy, not information. First Solar, for example, is moving toward utility-scale energy production. It doesn't make any sense to me that their competitors are Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor, and not Exxon and BP. I've never seen a good explanation for this sector classification.",Because the people who determine the categories are dead in the head.

Thee companies make microprocessors and specialized computer ships. The only semiconductors needed are analog power regulators and microcontrollers. Cheep parts which don't cost much and ar not made by Nevada and TSMC. Yes semiconductors are used in solar projects. but mostly they are small simple analog circus with and without a microcontroller. and descret transistors and diodes. most of the best known semiconductor stocks don't make these components. A quick look through the list showsminimarl capital gains and many that don't pay a dividend.As near as I can tell funds add these big well known companies to ETF's to attract investors to the fund and to improve the fund performonce. This list does list only solar stocks. it may not have all of them. Most of the companies listed are never mentioned on these forums. I looked for a good solar ETF a couple of years ago but didn't find a good one. A quick look through the list showsminimarl capital gains and many that don't pay a dividend.,1,0.523,NEGATIVE,1.0
