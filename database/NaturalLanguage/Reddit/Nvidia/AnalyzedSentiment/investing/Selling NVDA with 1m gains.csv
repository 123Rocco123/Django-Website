,"I’ve decided I’m going to sell a portion of my Nvidia stock once I hit $1million profit. As of close today, I need an additional 22% increase to hit this threshold so it will likely happen before the end of the month or by the end of summer if things slow down/correct. A little back story, I bought my first shares in Feb 2017 for $2.77 and again in October for $4.86. I’ve continued to buy big chunks of it over the last 7 years because I thought GPUs would be needed for self driving cars. Little did I know the Ai boom and to a smaller extent crypto would help Nvidia catapult to now the largest company in the world. My total cost basis is $34k and I’m sitting right around $850k. Gains are around 2600% which is insane. I still have more conviction that Ai is a bigger global threat than crypto so I’m a bit torn on actually selling any of it. If I sold all the other years people told me Nvidia had mooned, well I wouldn’t be sitting on the gains I have today. My gut is telling me to only sell 1/3 of my holding but I have no idea where else to rotate this into. I’m also in a unique tax situation where all my gains on this trade are locked into 0% which makes it tempting to let it ride for another year or two for a true FATfire setup. As with any compounding interest, once the snowball gets to this point, smaller 2-5% moves really move the needle (in both directions). Anyways, just want to share this with someone since I can’t really mention this to most of my friends without it affecting our relationship. It’s anyone’s real guess what will happen with Nvidia in the future so I can’t imagine anyone can persuade me one way or another on this trade. I’ve experienced similar gains on Tesla but failed to sell at the top and now only have a portion of my gains on that stock so I know when a bubble feels like a bubble and this is definitely in that territory now.","would you be more upset to sell before the top, or to sell lower than you are right now?",0,0.505,NEGATIVE,0.977

It seems like a good number. The reality is I’ll never go broke from my initial $34k investment. Something really awful would have to happen to Nvidia for it to drop that low. It just feels like I caught one of those lucky companies that catapults over everyone quickly to take the top position. I rode Apple and Amazon up back when I was broke and working at a retail store. But it was never anything like this ride.,3,0.519,NEGATIVE,0.993

Imagine saying the same thing about Apple when the iPhone 3 or 4 came out. Winning the lottery makes it feel like this is all a gamble and while me picking Nvidia seems like pure chance, the effort the company did to get to this point isn’t a lotto but rather extremely hard work.I have no idea what I should put this money into if I sell Nvidia. Last year I moved a ton of cash into a money market because I thought making 4-5% guaranteed interest would be the smart move to combat inflation. 3 months ago I moved all of that back into tech because it felt like 4-5% gains in this environment was actually losing to the market instead of beating inflation.It feels the same here. 35% of the entire S&P 500 has been attributed to Nvidia’s growth which is insane. Investing in the S&P seems like the wrong move when tech is pretty much responsible for the entire market staying afloat. Maybe moving it into a tech ETF is the answer.As for being set for life, $1m isn’t enough to do that. If you want your retirement to last you forever, the safe withdrawal rate is 4% and that’s only $40,000 a year. My goal has always been more around $4-5m but as inflation eats away at our purchasing power, I find that number continues to grow as years go on too.",1,0.54,NEGATIVE,1.0

,"I’ve decided I’m going to sell a portion of my Nvidia stock once I hit $1million profit. As of close today, I need an additional 22% increase to hit this threshold so it will likely happen before the end of the month or by the end of summer if things slow down/correct.

Little did I know the Ai boom and to a smaller extent crypto would help Nvidia catapult to now the largest company in the world. My total cost basis is $34k and I’m sitting right around $850k. Gains are around 2600% which is insane. I still have more conviction that Ai is a bigger global threat than crypto so I’m a bit torn on actually selling any of it. If I sold all the other years people told me Nvidia had mooned, well I wouldn’t be sitting on the gains I have today. My gut is telling me to only sell 1/3 of my holding but I have no idea where else to rotate this into. I’m also in a unique tax situation where all my gains on this trade are locked into 0% which makes it tempting to let it ride for another year or two for a true FATfire setup. As with any compounding interest, once the snowball gets to this point, smaller 2-5% moves really move the needle (in both directions). Anyways, just want to share this with someone since I can’t really mention this to most of my friends without it affecting our relationship. It’s anyone’s real guess what will happen with Nvidia in the future so I can’t imagine anyone can persuade me one way or another on this trade.

I’ve continued to buy big chunks of it over the last 7 years because I thought GPUs would be needed for self driving cars. Little did I know the Ai boom and to a smaller extent crypto would help Nvidia catapult to now the largest company in the world. My total cost basis is $34k and I’m sitting right around $850k. Gains are around 2600% which is insane. I still have more conviction that Ai is a bigger global threat than crypto so I’m a bit torn on actually selling any of it. If I sold all the other years people told me Nvidia had mooned, well I wouldn’t be sitting on the gains I have today. My gut is telling me to only sell 1/3 of my holding but I have no idea where else to rotate this into. I’m also in a unique tax situation where all my gains on this trade are locked into 0% which makes it tempting to let it ride for another year or two for a true FATfire setup. As with any compounding interest, once the snowball gets to this point, smaller 2-5% moves really move the needle (in both directions). Anyways, just want to share this with someone since I can’t really mention this to most of my friends without it affecting our relationship. It’s anyone’s real guess what will happen with Nvidia in the future so I can’t imagine anyone can persuade me one way or another on this trade. I’ve experienced similar gains on Tesla but failed to sell at the top and now only have a portion of my gains on that stock so I know when a bubble feels like a bubble and this is definitely in that territory now.",,8,,,
