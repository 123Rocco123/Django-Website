Let's say you have 9 puppies. You can sell them to 9 people = 1 puppy each. Or, 3 puppies per person = 3 each. But now the total price to the person with 3 is triple the price to the person with 1 puppy.That's like shares. You need to know the number of shares issued and the value of the company, to know the per share value, which is part of pricing (simplified greatly).Look at Berkshire Hathaway's price.Look at the words: Per share. If I offer you a 10% commission of everything I make, you get 10 cents of my $1, and $1 of my $10. The more you own, the more or less Value, because it is per share. If you only own half a share, you get or lose half as much as Value as someone who owns a whole share.If you put $2m into Amazon and it goes down 50%, you're still ""rich"" but you have a loss.I'm going to recommend watching the old Suze Orman shows on Freevee.
