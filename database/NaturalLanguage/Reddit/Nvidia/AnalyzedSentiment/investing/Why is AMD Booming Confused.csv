A lot of customers would have to switch their workloads from NVDA to AMD hardware which is more time and money, so for a lot of them it might still be faster to wait for NVDA than try to buy AMD a little earlier.It's mostly about cost, and for some customers the AMD cost works out to be lower.

Linus Gushing over the Epyc 9654 with it's 96 cores, 384 Megs of L3 cache, 128 PCI-5 Gen 5 lanes, and 12 channel DDR5 memory controller.And the 128 core Bergamo monster that Intel has no competitive answer to.And this quietly sexy beast, the Alveo Data Center accelerator from Xilinx The Alveo can do some wild things, seriously wild thingsa few years back AMD wasn't in literally ANY of the top500 super computers. But now....They lead the listAnd now Zen 5 is set to annihilate the idea of an entry level GPU. I've been waiting for Strix Halo for over 2 years. It's a Threadripper with a serviceable gaming GPU and a monster AI accelerator, that runs on a fucking battery. So many integrator have huge orders for the 8000 series.Intel's 2021 client and data center revenue was $63 Billion. There is so much money there for AMD to take. But now Intel can't seem to execute on anything properly.Intel's 14 gen is a total bust. They're having to overclock them from the factory to keep their parts competitive. But then under-clock them with firmware updates to keep them from burning out. Intel's budget GPU attempt fizzled.AMD is eating their lunch up and down the product stack. They are going to charge real money for the top end of Strix Halo. It's going to be a must have product.AMD failed to get any traction against generation after generation of Nvidia data center accelerators for a decade. Kepler, Maxwell, Pascal, Volta, Turing, Ampere, Hopper, and then Lovelace had no real threat from the red team. But now the MI300 series is positioned to actually take a bite out of Nvidia's data center business. Just when that business is exploding. That business was worth something like $47.5 Billion for fiscal year 2024. There is so much market space. If AMD captures even a small fraction of it, it's a huge amount of money.AMD's revenue this year will be truly massive.Check out the price target predictions here The low is 145. Average is 192.

Nvidia is very expensive as well as severely constrained with hardware buyers placing tens of billions of dollars in back orders.... For $40-70K accelerators, that go for $1.5M to $3M for a small sever rack appliance.There are other downstream opportunities as well with Supermicro and Dell also coming out as huge winners.Basically anyone with anything related to AI is popping right now.",0,0.54,NEGATIVE,0.998
