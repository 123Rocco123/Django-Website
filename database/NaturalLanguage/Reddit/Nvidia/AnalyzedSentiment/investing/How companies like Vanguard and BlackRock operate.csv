,"Hey professionals, i’m from Europe and I don’t totally understand how US investment companies work. I have a few questions I saw a tweet regarding Vanguard ownership in companies like Nvidia, Apple etc. It showed that they had 0 sole voting power and I understood that it is because they lend the stocks to short sellers. Can somebody please explain that why do they do this, who gets the voting power (Because it isn’t the borrower). They had shared voting power, but according to the tweet it means nothing, but then what it means?",Is it a tweet from someone that actually knows how investment managers work? Or some random self-professed finfluencer seeking to create a social media brand?In the US - investment managers have stewardship committees which are required to vote in the best interest of their shareholders. Some investment managers also have proxy voting processes - for example Vanguard and Blackrock:https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/about-us/investment-stewardship/blackrock-voting-choicehttps://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/how-we-advocate/investment-stewardship/stewardship-in-action.htmlSo for some funds - the fund holder can vote their percentage to inform the voting process at the fund manager.Regarding share lending - there are funds that will lend their shares - you have to look in the fund prospectus. The reason why this is done is because it reduces the fund expenses and can increase the net return for fund holders.,0,0.529,NEGATIVE,1.0

Yes these firms lend stock to short sellers but it is generally a small percentage of what they own. In terms of who gets the voting power, the borrow sells and the buyer gets the voting power.",0,0.518,NEGATIVE,0.862

Those passive investors are primarily invested via a variety of investment vehicles managed by major providers like Blackrock and Vanguard.Blackrock and Vanguard do -not- own those positions. Investment vehicles -managed- by them do. In most cases, this means Blackrock or Vanguard must, as the manager, exercise the voting rights on behalf of the actual owners (the investors). They are legally required to do this in the way that is beneficial to those actual owners, not to Vanguard or Blackrock themselves. Large providers like Blackrock and Vanguard are generally very clear about how this works, often outsource the voting decisions to a third party to avoid even the appearance of conflict, and in the case of BLackrock with it's large investors (insurance funds, pension funds etc) they are moving to actually having multiple different 'voting stances' that you can select between. It wouldn't shock me if that type of ability eventually flows through to smaller investors.FWIW, to the extent those managers do have their own bias on how they want voting, they've sometimes spoken about it: they are keen to see voting that provides a long term sustainable growth in global economy. Why? because their business model is to deliver the entire market. Short term wins and losses of individual companies don't matter to them, long term growth does.If you're also interested in proxy voting, i might additionally point your attention to Norges Bank who manage the large Norwegian SWF. They actually make public their voting intentions a week before every single shareholder vote, and if voting against management explain why. If you're interested to know the sorts of issues that shareholders are sometimes disagreeing with management over, that would give you a feel for it.",0,0.527,NEGATIVE,0.999

Often managers will do this but then recall the shares before any votes so they can vote those shares, then lend them out again. Vanguard and Blackrock will vote any shares they haven't lent out. But they want to avoid regulatory scrutiny their large ownership of every public company, plus the additional income during voting days, so they may intentionally not recall shares during votes.When A lends shares to short seller B and B sells them to C who holds them during the vote, C is the one who can vote.
