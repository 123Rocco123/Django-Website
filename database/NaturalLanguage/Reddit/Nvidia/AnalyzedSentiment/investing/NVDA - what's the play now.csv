You do see a ton of people making emotional investments, and you do see a ton of people sometimes not investing based on research. Sometimes they win, but sometimes the old moustached man at the roulette table wins too. Most investors on reddit are stupid, following memes, or just going with bandwagons.

Inversing him would’ve meant you sold in the $200-300 range.So I have no idea.
