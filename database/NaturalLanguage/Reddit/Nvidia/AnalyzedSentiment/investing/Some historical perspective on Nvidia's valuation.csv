,"As we all know, Nvidia jumped 25% in a day on Thursday, one of the largest single day market cap gains in history. Now up ~175% YTD, in a market that has rallied strongly since the start of the year, with AI being the hot new thing, there is talks of Nvidia (and AI in general) being a bubble. That Nvidia is overvalued. But I want to point this out: despite the 25% jump in price this week, NVDA shares actually got cheaper on a forward P/E basis. https://i.imgur.com/xPQR2OF.png Prior to the report, it was traded at ~60x forward earnings. After the report, it trades at ~50x. And that 50x is only ~1 standard deviation away from it's 5 year average range. This relative valuation holds for pretty much every metric https://i.imgur.com/iMejuuf.png Relative to it's peers, Nvidia, despite the massive single day jump, doesn't trade much more than above it's historical average. https://i.imgur.com/4nP2u9w.png Why is this? Because in hindsight, analyst expectations were somehow too low. One year forward revenue grew from ~$30B to ~$40B, a 33% jump Two year forward revenue went from ~$37B to ~$50B, a 35% jump One year forward EPS went from ~$4.55 to ~$7, a 55% jump Two year forward EPS went from ~$6.50 to ~$9.60, a 46% jump 2025 operating profit expectations a week ago were $16.6B. After reporting, now $27B Forward gross margins went from 67.5% to 70.5% Forward free cash flow went from $11.4B to $20.4B I know it sounds like beating a dead horse here, but Nvidia just gave guidance that is them screaming that a transformational change is incoming. Will the stock continue to keep going up every day? Of course not. But the calls of Nvidia being overvalued based simply on price action is ignoring the fundamental shift.","If the forward PE goes down on a jump up in price, it means the buy side doesn't fully agree with the magnitude of the earnings increase by the sell side consensus. If you had a full DCF model you'd see something like the consensus projecting 30% top line growth, and the implied growth being something like 25% growth. This would be an increase from say 20% before the jump. Your job is to determine if the newly implied 25% growth seems greedy by your estimates, and if it is then you should sell the stock.",0,0.566,NEGATIVE,1.0

Nvidia and it's peers trade at a premium to the market multiple. And even with the big jump on Thursday, they trade at a relative to it's peer multiple that is cheaper than the prior multiple.I'm not saying go out and buy Nvidia or anything. Just that the term ""overvalued"" is relative to some valuation. If you think Nvidia is overvalued after a 25% jump and 175% YTD increase, then you had to have also thought it was more overvalued recently prior to it and has been overvalued for years. That is fine! But it has been one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500 over the past 5-10years, so clearly the market has been buying the multiple.",1,0.555,NEGATIVE,0.999

How are you supposed to know whether a company is worth 25x PE or 35x PE? They're both just arbitrary numbers from the layman's perspective. You need to have a full DCF model to understand what's really being priced in at 25x and 35x to therefore know whether you should be buying or selling. And if you don't have one, then you're actually just a momentum buyer/seller following technical rules. Not saying that can't work in the short run, but how are you supposed to know when something is actually overvalued? You actually can't. Instead you just fooled yourself into thinking you know how to define value from one arbitrary number following historical patterns.Also the market does trade on a consensus principal, because what do you think the NTM PE is based on? It's the sell side consensus EPS estimates. Also if the buyside is pricing in a 'margin of safety', then that means they think the sell side is getting greedy and therefore don't agree with the magnitude of the increase I'm expectations.",2,0.536,NEGATIVE,1.0

Their valuations are based on very high future earnings growth.If we take a look at TSLA's net income vs market cap in hindsightEnd of 2020 they were worth 668bn, yet their 2020 net income was 0.7bn. 954 PE.End of 2022 they were worth 389bn, yet their 2022 net income was 12.56bn. 31 PE.TSLA's valuation was wildly controversial back then because everyone had different expectations. Now their valuation is not so controversial with a lot of their growth already realized.As you said, the forward PE ratio could easily be 40-50 but with the headline PE ratio being 200, many people are conservative and see it as risky.I predict NVDA will stop being controversial in 1-2 years once they realize or don't realize the growth",0,0.558,NEGATIVE,0.999

May go up, may go down.The point is that the valuation today is based almost entirely on estimates of what profits will be in the future, and at current prices - high growth is being assumed like TSLA did. Keep in mind TSLA's story is not over yet.It seems on reddit, people aren't comfortable with investing in a stock based on high profits in the future.People seem to be more comfortable investing in mature companies where profits aren't going to grow massively but trade in 20s PE and 30s PE seems to be accepted for companies with moderate growth.I think stocks trading at ""low valuations"" can give people a false sense of security.I can't fault people for investing in INTC when it was trading at 10 PE for the last 5 years, but we can see that what looks like a ""value"" stock can be extremely risky.I believe the market is reasonably efficient most of the time, and we can see there was good reason the market valued INTC at 10 PE.",2,0.539,NEGATIVE,1.0

,"As we all know, Nvidia jumped 25% in a day on Thursday, one of the largest single day market cap gains in history. Now up ~175% YTD, in a market that has rallied strongly since the start of the year, with AI being the hot new thing, there is talks of Nvidia (and AI in general) being a bubble. That Nvidia is overvalued. But I want to point this out: despite the 25% jump in price this week, NVDA shares actually got cheaper on a forward P/E basis. https://i.imgur.com/xPQR2OF.png Prior to the report, it was traded at ~60x forward earnings. After the report, it trades at ~50x. And that 50x is only ~1 standard deviation away from it's 5 year average range. This relative valuation holds for pretty much every metric https://i.imgur.com/iMejuuf.png Relative to it's peers, Nvidia, despite the massive single day jump, doesn't trade much more than above it's historical average. https://i.imgur.com/4nP2u9w.png Why is this? Because in hindsight, analyst expectations were somehow too low. One year forward revenue grew from ~$30B to ~$40B, a 33% jump Two year forward revenue went from ~$37B to ~$50B, a 35% jump One year forward EPS went from ~$4.55 to ~$7, a 55% jump Two year forward EPS went from ~$6.50 to ~$9.60, a 46% jump 2025 operating profit expectations a week ago were $16.6B. After reporting, now $27B Forward gross margins went from 67.5% to 70.5% Forward free cash flow went from $11.4B to $20.4B I know it sounds like beating a dead horse here, but Nvidia just gave guidance that is them screaming that a transformational change is incoming. Will the stock continue to keep going up every day? Of course not. But the calls of Nvidia being overvalued based simply on price action is ignoring the fundamental shift.",Tldr,0,0.5,POSITIVE,0.98
