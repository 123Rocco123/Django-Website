,"I'm in a bit of a conundrum with my NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) investment and could really use some advice. Currently, I own 50 shares of NVDA valued at around $30,000, purchased back in 2017 at $34 per share, with a cost basis of $1,700. This stock has seen unbelievable growth since then of over 1600% and now constitutes 45% of my non-taxable investment account and roughly 20% of all my investment accounts, excluding my home. Last year, I sold about $5000 worth of NVDA to diversify, but I'm torn about what to do next. On one hand, the stock has been on a tear, and their future looks extremely promising with AI advancements and the huge demand for chips going forward. However, I'm aware of the need to diversify, as well as the risk of the stock taking a massive downturn and significantly hurting my net worth. There are also tax considerations if I sell, since I'll be on the hook for some significant capital gains tax. For some context, I'm a married man with two kids, a house with $200k in equity and a $200k mortgage. I have around $80k in IRA accounts and $65k in taxable brokerage accounts amd some cash on hand for emergency fund etc. Little debt otherwise. Any advice on whether to sell and diversify, ways to mitigate risks, or hedging strategies would be greatly appreciated. How should I navigate this situation, considering the potential tax bill, its outsized share of my portfolio and the promising future for NVDA? Thanks in advance for your insights!","You won. Don’t push it too hard. Sell enough to be happy and keep a little to keep some upside, but stocks don’t do this once they become one of the biggest companies in the world.Take a victory lap and reduce your own stress.

With that being said you will never time it at topNothing wrong with taking profits and don’t ever feel bad especially with a trade like yours. Nvda has alot of ups and downs so just do what your heart tells ya.It’s a tough position and you if you want to roll the dice then do it. I have no doubt it will probably make it over $1000 in a few yearsBut it could drop as well. If it were me I’d let it ride until I made $100,000 profit",0,0.531,0.632,POSITIVE

Sitting on 225 shares myself, bought originally back in 2014 and another large purchase in 2015. Up 7,938% on that 2015 lot for instance. Took some profits in 2017 and sold some and 225 is what remains. Also married with 2 kids. 275k home equity, 403b, Roth, couple brokerage accounts all funded, so very similar. I'm on track or ahead depending on who you ask, so you and I don't need to make up for lost time/returns/balances. We're healthy otherwise basicallyHere's the thing though, the story hasn't changed. This is the moment I've been waiting on all these years. I guess it depends on your age but I'm in my mid 30s and have at least 15-20 years till retirement. NVDA easily is a $1,000+ per share company within the next 2-5 years probably. If there's a drastic downturn, maybe that will be delayed, but at 10 years it's a certainty.As I said in the link below in 2017, which is the first mention of my holdings I'm holding for the long game. Great company and the party is just getting started. Short-term corrections don't bother me, but it is high beta stock, So if you don't think you can stomach downturns then maybe take some profits but I'm not worried about it in the long runhttp://stocktwits.com/mikel3113/message/71190466",0,0.561,0.619,POSITIVE

If you still believe NVDA has room to grow, figure out what % of your portfolio you want to leave in a single stock and leave that much and diversify the rest. The general rule is that a single stock has a larger chance of tanking, but it also has a larger chance to rise faster than the rest of the market, ETC, ETC.If you really really really don't want to deal with the capital gains tax (useful thing to experience, its better than income tax, TBH), I don't know what your investment strategy is, but you could technically keep your NVDA shares if you REAAAAAAALLY believe in them, and then instead as you go forward invest into broad indexes. Over time your NVDA shares SHOULD become a smaller portion of your portfolio. Personally, I can't imagine NVDA going bankrupt any time soon, but that doesn't mean they can't lose 50% of their evaluation.Personally, I'm very very hesitant to keep money in a concentrated position. I've been diversifying out of one over the last two years, so I have some bias there. I stayed in a position that kept growing and growing and growing much faster than the market, until one day, it fell down.

,"I'm in a bit of a conundrum with my NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) investment and could really use some advice. Currently, I own 50 shares of NVDA valued at around $30,000, purchased back in 2017 at $34 per share, with a cost basis of $1,700. This stock has seen unbelievable growth since then of over 1600% and now constitutes 45% of my non-taxable investment account and roughly 20% of all my investment accounts, excluding my home. Last year, I sold about $5000 worth of NVDA to diversify, but I'm torn about what to do next. On one hand, the stock has been on a tear, and their future looks extremely promising with AI advancements and the huge demand for chips going forward. However, I'm aware of the need to diversify, as well as the risk of the stock taking a massive downturn and significantly hurting my net worth. There are also tax considerations if I sell, since I'll be on the hook for some significant capital gains tax. For some context, I'm a married man with two kids, a house with $200k in equity and a $200k mortgage. I have around $80k in IRA accounts and $65k in taxable brokerage accounts amd some cash on hand for emergency fund etc. Little debt otherwise. Any advice on whether to sell and diversify, ways to mitigate risks, or hedging strategies would be greatly appreciated. How should I navigate this situation, considering the potential tax bill, its outsized share of my portfolio and the promising future for NVDA?

Congrats on your gain. a) you've taken your ""risked"" money off the table. b) do you have a better use for the $30K?All I know about Nvidia is encapsulated in your near last line, they have a promising future. Wall Street rewards growth and Nvidia is going to grow for the next 10 years imo. It is not, will not be, straight up. In fact, Nvidia will disappoint at some point and provide buying opportunities. But in the end they are well run and very well positioned to take advantage of the growth of AI in the world.Nvidia's GTC (Graphics technology conference) is coming up in early March. It can get a bit wonky/technical, but listen to the CEO's keynote, and see how you feel after that.Personally, I hold an outsized position in Nvidia, my strategy is been DCA in and DCA out for years. It hasn't treated my wrong yet",0,0.549,1.0,POSITIVE

Which one are you?Traders don't care what direction, they just want to get in and on the right side before a move happens. Investors have a different perspective on high tech stocks. They want to get in with great companies with long term growth prospects. They are rewarded over time. I'm on the investor side, dollar cost averaging in and out.One should do their own due diligence and choose their own timing. Don't let fomo guide.

I think this is a generational stock that will continue to grow for years to come. I’m holding and not backing off. I think it’s going to split again in 12-24 months. I went through the roller coaster maybe 5 years ago and stayed put.  My opinion only but I’m not going anywhere w these guys.  It going to one of the Top 2/3 companies in the world as it’s darn close today.  It can make normal people millionaires w their retirement.  I’m all in. ,0,0.531,0.998,NEGATIVE
