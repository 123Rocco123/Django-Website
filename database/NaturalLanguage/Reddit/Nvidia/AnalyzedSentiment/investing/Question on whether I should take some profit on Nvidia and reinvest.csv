,"For context, I am 25 years old and from the UK. I bought 5 shares of Nvidia in late May 2020. Fast forward to today and they have obviously risen considerably and I have seen multiple stocks splits. I have been investing in SP500 and other stocks in the meantime too, and would say that my stake in NVDA now accounts for about 38% of my portfolio. My question is whether I should reduce my position, take out the profits and put them back into an ETF? Alternatively, I’m thinking that I’m young and can take the risk to see a potential greater upside over the next 5-10 years? What would your advice be? Many thanks in advance.","If you're asking this question, then yes, it's time to sell and reallocate. Keep some in nvda if you want for fun but lock in the majority of your profits now.You are very fortunate and had a good run. Don't push your already rare luck any further.",0,0.513,POSITIVE,0.999

I think I will reduce my position in it, but keep a little.",0,0.533,NEGATIVE,0.996
