They think that the top 7 companies are going to lose 25-50% in the next 6 months, which is insane. For that to happen, the rest of the market would have similar losses, so buying a hypothetical SP493 would lose them just as much as buying the SP500.Hedging would be to just continue to buy SP500, but buy some far OTM puts on those companies. They're relatively stable so the premiums wouldn't even be that bad, especially 25-50% out of the money.You're misunderstanding options and seeing them as gambling because that's what most people on reddit use them for.

Essentially if you ignore the Mag7 we have just witnessed a huge stock market crash. The Mag7 just hide that.This year I bought a small position in several high profile stocks at multi-year or multi-decade lows (Intel, Boeing etc). They're bouncing around slightlight higher and lower but I'm luckily still in the green (although Im bag holding a few).I dont think the mag7 will tank. I think they will stay relatively flat. I believe the value stocks are way undervalued at the moment and they have a multi-bagging upside potential.Ive hedged quite wide so if any few of my stocks tanks I'm still OK. Over a 12 month time span, I think its much more likely that some of the value stocks will double in value than any of the mag7.I have a portfolio of about 20 S&P500 stocks, just the ones that seem abnormally cheap and seem to have a potential to return. I have no crystal ball so any one of them could still tank or go to the moon but hedging like this means the overall portfolio nudges a little bit up or down each day and Im not seeing any crazy swings.I just feel there is no logic to the insanely high prices the Mag7 are holding just as there is no logic on how crazy low some of the non-Mag 7 seem to be. Some of these businesses are going through some tough times so that's priced in for now but if they turn things around the upside potential is high. If Apple are doing everything right then max price is probably baked in. If the AI bubble inflates or iPhone sales start to dip then there is a massive downside potential to these stocks.I feel like if you took a small position in a selection of several stocks you feel are undervalued then you could see the results youre hoping for. I still keep 25% of my position in cash just in case we have a crazy day and a desirable stock falls to a bargain price.",2,0.539,NEGATIVE,0.999

Thanks for any feedback!","If you remove these 7 tech growth stocks from S&P500 you see avg annul return of only 3-3.5% from other 490+ stocks. 85% momentum is driven by these 6-8 high fliers. When 7 growth stocks slow down you already anticipate no growth or negative return as we experienced in 2022, 2018, 2015, 2011, and mostly during 2008.The choices you have are RSP or even a more conservative dia index. RSP is an equally weight S&P. It avg returns about 1% less than S&P. From 2004-2022, the inflation adjusted annual rtrn was +7.63%(RSP) vs +8.62%(S&P) with 2% less risk. If you want to remove them completely I recommend DIA. Just 30 stocks only tech that I see is MSFT but is -13% volatile than S&P. The DIA returns when factor in inflation gave an impressive 7.12% annualized return.The money managers role is protect your asset. Very few fund managers can beat S&P returns as you already know. To say putting money all into S&P like VOO and walk away is an understatement. VOO has lower volume one can not easily sell cc for income which means you need to go to SPY with a higher expense. One also misses the opportunities in mid cap and small cap when putting money into large cap stocks. There are also foreign stocks to consider when deal with US stocks.Hope that helps.",0,0.526,NEGATIVE,0.981

The big boys don't have ceiling room for big multiples like that, especially if you believe they are already overvalued.For less risk but more work, you can buy puts on the option market.

The M7 is already fracturing with Apple and Tesla being iffy. The noise about AI echoes what I remember hearing during the dotcom boom before it burst. In both cases no one was looking seriously at the trendy tech. Too much wishful thinking in play.One really dark view is to find funds that invest in the good ol military industrial complex. Even if Trump chokes off the Ukraine pipeline, the US will probably still be manufacturing things that go boom 1) for Israel and 2) to replenish our own armories. Another less dark view is to consider international funds which seem to go up when the US markets go down.As far as jumping late onto the bandwagon?
