,"Warren Buffet once said something like 'be greedy when others are fearful, be fearful when others are greedy' There is also the shoeshine boy effect of Joe Kennedy. Supposedly when Joe Kennedy started getting stock tips from his shoeshine boy, that is when he knew it was time to leave the market. Supposedly he just made this story up to cover for insider trading, but its still a good lesson. I feel like a stock goes through certain steps. At each step the potential gain goes down while the potential losses go up. Is there a name for this process? FWIW my money is in index funds, so I don't really know a lot about the psychology of the stock market. But it would go something like this step one. Only insiders who work in the industry have specialized knowledge and they can use that knowledge to buy low. This would be examples of insider trading (which is illegal) or politicians like Nancy Pelosi buying stocks based on confidential government information about government policy related to publicly traded companies (which is legal, but should be illegal). Knowledge that is public, but is very esoteric and hidden. There is knowledge out there about a new technology, new policy, etc that will affect the stocks price but the only people that know about it are experts in the field. Its public knowledge, but only a handful of experts know the info. Knowledge that is public and fairly well known. Basically anyone with google can find the knowledge. Knowledge that is mainstream. The mainstream media reports on the knowledge. Knowledge that causes hype. I guess an example of this would be NVIDIA or Tesla. After a while there was massive hype in these companies, and the stock prices didn't reflect their P/E ratios. At this point the general public who have no knowledge of stocks jumps on the bandwagon and ends up losing money when the stock crashes. NVIDIA hasn't crashed, but it might. With each step, the knowledge of the stock becomes more public and the less informed the investors become. Its not a perfect system by any means. Bitcoin went through the last phase of the general public jumping on the bandwagon and crashed in 2021, but it recovered from the crash and is now worth more than it was in 2020. However bitcoin only went above its 2021 peak in the last few months. Bitcoin peaked at 61k in October of 2021, crashed, and only went back up to 62k in June of 2024. But stocks like Tesla did drop after they became mainstream 'good ideas' to buy for uninformed investors. However Tesla has had both dips and peaks since it lowered from its peak.",Isn't it interesting how the public's excitement about a company can sometimes override what the experts predict? What do you think influences these shifts in stock market sentiment so strongly?,0,0.591,NEGATIVE,0.892

Then information is publicly released, at which point it is almost immediately completely factored into the stock price. There are no intermediate steps.",0,0.533,NEGATIVE,0.902
