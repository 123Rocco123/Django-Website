,"This will be a small percentage of my portfolio. My current portfolio is fairly balanced, ranging from high yield savings to moderately aggressive retirement funds.

Absolutely do not buy into NVIDIA right now as it's super volatile and more likely to go down than up after earnings. When buying and selling you're either chasing those sharp spikes up that some stocks make or you're chasing slightly slower but still good growth across a few months but usually less than a year. Risk is moderate, really depends just what you invest on, and the gains can be good but usually are in the 15-30% if you actually make a good trade. Of course you also risk losing money.Alternatively there's options trading. A favorite for risky active investors, you can make money both on the way up and down. As long as you're only buying calls and puts, you're risking to lose premiums. If you're selling contracts you might lose more than you put in so maybe avoid that. Same for CFDs, leverage works both ways.I say start with handpicking stocks before you try options.",0,0.534,NEGATIVE,0.998
