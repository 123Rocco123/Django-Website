,"I'm 23 and fresh out of college. I just secured a semi-permanent teaching job at a school district. I recently opened an IRA with Fidelity and I currently have about $300 in there planning on putting at least a few hundred a month in it. I talked to two people, my uncle and my gf's dad. My uncle told me to invest in some utilities like DUK or NEE and some in household goods. I believe after looking at market trends it would be a good idea to wait till Q4 of this year or Q1 of next year to buy. I was considering Duke Energy, Nvidia, RIOT, Nike, Norfolk Southern, Union Pacific, and Rivian as some stocks to buy. My gf's dad told me to not even consider stocks, and to mainly invest in itrustcapital and focus on short term gains via crypto. My uncle's plan seems more reasonable to me, but I am also interested in maybe putting 15-20 percent into crypto. Crypto seems alittle to volatile. I assume my 403b will already be put into some sort of mutual fund. What would you do if you were me? Where so I go to learn more, and what advice should I take from my uncle and my gf's dad?","Visit https://403bwise.org/ to learn about your 403B options.You are a teacher, not an investor. You should ignore both of them. Invest in broad based market index funds like VT and BND.",0,0.524,NEGATIVE,1.0
