MSFT and Alphabet and IBM may well be better bets to be the (or a) quantum-computer winner, but quantum revenues won't even double their stock price.I believe AI will be much bigger than quantum, and it's already producing value (and profits) while quantum computing is not. I like the quantum opportunity but I don't expect it to be as big a deal as AI. That doesn't mean AI is the better investment, since competition is fierce and it's not clear who -- what companies or even industries--will be able to get the most profit from it. But it does mean that investors have a lot of shiny-looking investment opportunities in AI, which is likely already draining some potential investment dollars from quantum.To be clear: no one knows which approach to quantum computer hardware will survive. Also, even with more capable hardware, it is not yet clear that quantum algorithms will be invented (discovered?) that will deliver the promised ""quantum advantage"" in important commercial applications. In other words, this is not a place you should make a big bet with all your retirement savings.",0,0.538,0.999,NEGATIVE

No idea how that compares to what RGTI has, but in either case they have to find buyers to make money.Second, it's not clear how useful either RGTI's current systems (with which I am not familiar) or IONQ's current AQ-35 system are. IONQ's claim for an example application for their next-gen AQ-64 system promised for 2025 is pretty modest: they say it will be able to optimize airport gate management for a ""small European airport."" More ambitious applications like drug discovery or breaking current encryption keys are much farther away. And the set of problem classes where quantum machines are known to have a big performance advantage over conventional computers is still pretty limited. So significant commercial value of applying quantum computers is not current, and of uncertain size.Third, whether quantum computers will greatly speed up AI applications is still a big TBD.

I literally did not know about them. No, I have no NVDA which just shows how ignorant I can be.So, It's hard for me to agree that AI is the bigger (more important) technological advancement over the possibility of usable Quantum Computing. Obviously, I am hyped about AI - and have been for 30 years - and see it on par with the other greatest invention of mankind; the printing press. Without that we would still require a lifetime to gain a lifetime of knowledge, and that is defined as stagnation. When ChatGPT 3.5 hit the public I heard predictions of (good and bad) things happening in the next 5 to 10 years. I asked my small group of friends that had some grasp of what we had and asked them to write down what they see AI accomplishing/being used for/etc. in just 48 months so they could look back and see just how wrong they were. So, yes, it is astonishing, if even that word could describe its importance. Three weeks ago I mentioned to these same people that I would give it a year and Ukraine would have AI in their asymmetrical warfare usage of drones, and I just read today that it is already happening. When ChatGPT came out of the closet, so to speak, most did not understand that it had not just been created. It had just been behind a paywall and unless that was your area of interest or skill set you didn't know about it, but others did and had been working with it. There was all this talk about the dangers, but nobody was detailing those dangers for quite some time. The two hot ones that made the Godfather of AI quit Google/Facebook (I forget) were the fact of how easily we could be manipulated as a species, and autonomous weaponry. Then there is talk about regulating it which has to be the best joke of the century. So, yes I believe the impact of AI is world changing, if not species changing. Why the chest thumping? I just wanted to show that I think I have some grasp on why it's important. I think quantum computing will be like jumping the gap of laying down little lead letters and pressing one page at a time to my inkjet or laser printer - or even better, Kindle. It will take something great and transform it into what I can only imagine. There are problems that all the supercomputers today - using AI - could try to solve just one of them and it would still take them a million years when quantum could do it in seconds. It's hard to put the two on a scale and see which weighs heavier. I am not a hard core Singularity fanatic, but Kurzwell's data is hard to ignore along with the exponential growth he spoke of, and it will take the marriage of AI and Quantum computing to realize something like it.",1,0.53,0.998,NEGATIVE

"" Amen to that!One reason I am not super excited about quantum super-charging AI is that I don't think advancing AI toward AGI or ASI is a matter of more computational power, but rather architectural breakthroughs similar to (but not identical to) the LLM approach. After all, our low-power brains do AGI right now. (I do get it that more power means that enormous amounts of data can be turned into a model quickly, vs. the decade or so it takes us humans to reach AGI (animal general intelligence!)

Classic physics and chemistry still uses electrons and protons etc. It got to the stage where all 4 mathematics, physics, chemistry (and perhaps latter biology) as smel was thought to be particles based way later than wave based than the other 6 senses.It does explain however like in biology the missing link in how photosynthesis works, as photons are the catalyst to start it off, but I did a PhD in branch of chemistry that applies the principles and equations of quantum mechanics to the study of molecules called Chemical Physics. No one umdersSo your own conclusion is wrong.It could give me much more power than AI if it can produce theories that AI cannot explain now as API chat is like an intelligent 16 writing an essay. It is not going to put out theories that has different probabilities as to which one could be right or not.Just think of it like you are doing in economics, If Quantum Learning is based of lots of data and more probability based outcomes it could be massive that is impossible to predict otherwise as the current computing power isn't there.AI is still based on microchips to feeds it hunger. It has a limit. But if AI is powerful enough to actually process Quantum computing then those doing both or at least the latter will be a huge transformation AI is short term but has accelerated. QL is at the start , and for the longer term, as both will become even bigger if quantum Artificial Intelligence came togetherBut I don't have the knowledge to know what to invest in, as I am not an economist's. I guess as IONQ and Hyundai are doing both together to try and catch Tesla up who are very undervalued short term as they are the other one that technology actually is working and progressing.
