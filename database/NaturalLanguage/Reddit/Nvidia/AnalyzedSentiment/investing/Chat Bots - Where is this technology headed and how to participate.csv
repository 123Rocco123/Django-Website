It's very good background to understanding the power that is coming from the chat bots that are in development and how they may be deployed Some may note that last November Nvidia and Microsoft announced they would build a ""massive"" AI server utilizing Nvidia parts as their key compute engines. Servicing Bing Chat is clearly what that massive server is about, at least initially. Microsoft is clearly going after all the eyeballs Google has attracted, something on the order of 8 BILLION searches a day. As a thought exercise: If Google's 8B searches are basically up for grabs, imagine for a moment how many other companies will need systems that are competitive with Bing Chat. Not just Google, but Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba. Then there are the second tier guys, folks like IBM, and Oracle and Salesforce.

They are building the guts to all those Tesla-esque data centers that need to be built out.

ChatGPT's app climbed to 100 million users faster than any other app in history, so a lot of people want to use it despite the flaws. And if you do a bit of looking around the Internet you'll find that people actually don't really mind the flaws in chatbots right now. There's subreddits that are basically dedicated to posting what kinds of funny things you can get Bing and ChatGPT to tell you, people love the fact that Bing actually has a personality.While Microsoft quickly pulled their Tay bot from Twitter after people turned it into a racist conspiracy theorist, these chat bots don't remember things from session to session, so I don't see that being a real problem.The misinformation issues might become more an issue in the longer term, but right now people know not to expect perfection from it.",1,0.513,0.999,NEGATIVE

Nvidia dominates ai computing today but that's based on tensor cores. Tensor cores are the main ai chip today used for things today like neural nets and generative design. Chatgpt is based on transformers. Google has been working on transformer chips longer than anyone and is 2-3 years ahead of everyone else. Google's market share is tiny in ai chips because Chatgpt is the first mainstream product ever.
