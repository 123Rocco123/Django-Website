,"So to make numbers lets say I use $100. I can buy fractional shares and I buy nvidia for $100. I see a 5% gain over whatever period of time, and I sell. I take half the profit and save it for taxes, and the other half I feed into a SWPPX. That initial $100 dollars gets reinvested into something new. Always hold till a gain or if I am spooked a break even at the very least. Am I planning on making a living doing this? No. Do I want to? Not at the moment, maybe in the future when I have excess capital and a very stable and broad financial base. Whats wrong with this? Alot of friends tell me its pointless, its only gonna bite me in the ass in the end, and so on. I have done it a few times and it seems to work alright. It might be a bit of time waster, but I dont commit more than 15 minutes to it a day. I just buy low and sell high.

Like you will literally never be up on it. I've had a lot of success buying individual stocks. I've made a small fortune on AAPL and GOOG. I've also bought my share of losers.I bought GE and was never up on it. By the time two jet Jeff was done destroying the company my shares were in the single digits (down from almost $30). Massive insurance underwriting losses in GE capital. Terrible acquisitions and spin offs. Spent billions on buybacks at ridiculously high prices. I honestly can't even remember all the stupid things, so suffice it to say they destroyed a lot of value.I bought a company called CBI (Chicago Bridge & Iron). It had cost overruns on major industrial developments like nuclear sites. It was eventually acquired when it faced bankruptcy. The stock doesn't even exist today.OP, your strategy is likely to work okay most of the time. Although it severely limits upside if you do select a winner. But eventually you'll select a stinker. Everyone who invests in individual stocks does at some point and it's unpredictable. You'll be down and wondering what to do next. Wait? Double down on a loser? There's no promise that companies always go up at some point in the future.",1,0.535,NEGATIVE,1.0

I think what would be best is if you come to terms with how much you don’t know. This goes for a lot of people and it’s ok and normal. You’re on Reddit asking a fairly simple question and the people helping you also don’t know very much comparatively but they all see the flaw in your plan instantly. You have no edge in investing and you never will. Most of us don’t. By the time you hear about a trendy stock the smart money is looking for an exit. Money you lose will be the profits of others.

When bear markets come, they usually come unannounced and hit hard.Also what you're doing is trying to time your buy and sell, which has been shown to underperform just buying and holding.",0,0.55,NEGATIVE,0.819

It's great that you're thinking about investing and exploring different approaches. Let's break down your strategy and consider some important factors:Short-term trading: Your approach involves frequent buying and selling, which is essentially short-term trading. This strategy can be challenging and may not be as effective as long-term investing for most individuals.Tax implications: Frequent trading can lead to higher tax liabilities. Short-term capital gains (on assets held for less than a year) are typically taxed at a higher rate than long-term capital gains.Transaction costs: Depending on your brokerage, frequent trading might incur transaction fees that can eat into your profits.Market timing: Consistently ""buying low and selling high"" is extremely difficult, even for professional traders.Time commitment: While 15 minutes a day might not seem like much, over time it adds up.Emotional decision-making: This strategy might lead to making decisions based on short-term market movements rather than fundamental analysis.Instead of this approach, you might consider:Dollar-cost averaging into broad market index funds or ETFs.Holding investments for the long term to benefit from compound growth and more favorable tax treatment.Diversifying across different asset classes and sectors to manage risk.Some brokerages, like M1, offer automated investing features that can help implement a more passive, long-term strategy with minimal time commitment.Remember, investing is personal, and what works for one person may not work for another. It's great that you're experimenting and learning, but be sure to consider the long-term implications of your strategy.Disclosures",0,0.534,NEGATIVE,0.99
