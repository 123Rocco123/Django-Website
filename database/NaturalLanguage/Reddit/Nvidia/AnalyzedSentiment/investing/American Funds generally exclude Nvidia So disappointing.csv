,"I inherited a sizable Roth IRA, and looked at the portfolio composition and was disappointed that Nvidia is not even a part of many of their funds. The 4 funds that are in the portfolio have such a large overlap, it makes no sense why the financial planner would do this. The expense ratios are extremely high, and the holdings make no sense either: American Balanced Fund¬Æ (ABALX) mostly Microsoft, Broadcom, and Google Capital Income Builder¬Æ (CAIBX) mostly Broadcom, Phillip Morris, and Abby Vie The Growth Fund of America¬Æ (AGTHX) mostly Microsoft, Meta, and Google (AHA...Nvidia is actually in there, but only at 3.5% of the fund) The Investment Company of America¬Æ (AIVSX) Microsoft, Broadcom, Microsoft, Google, Meta. The amount of money that was ""lost"" by not having more more exposure to nvidia is absurd. Why don't their funds just track the S&P 500? I plan to hold onto this Roth for the next 10 years, let it grow, then make a lump sum RMD, but I am very upset over the high expense ratios of about 0.63%. I am considering selling these positions and buying just one good one that has more of nvidia. I really don't like these expense ratios and it almost feels like extortion. I have also considered looking into an Inherited Roth IRA transfer to fidelity, if that's even possible.

I plan to hold onto this Roth for the next 10 years, let it grow, then make a lump sum RMD, but I am very upset over the high expense ratios of about 0.63%. I am considering selling these positions and buying just one good one that has more of nvidia. I really don't like these expense ratios and it almost feels like extortion. I have also considered looking into an Inherited Roth IRA transfer to fidelity, if that's even possible. Is it even possible to transfer an inherited Roth IRA?","‚ÄúI got a lot of free money and it didn‚Äôt include the stock I wanted‚ÄùYou know how to fix that? Sell it and put it in nvidia, since you think you know better than the fund managers.",0,0.545,NEGATIVE,1.0
