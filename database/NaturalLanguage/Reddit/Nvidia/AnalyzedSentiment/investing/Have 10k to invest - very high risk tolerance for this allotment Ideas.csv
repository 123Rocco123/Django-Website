,"I’ve come into some money recently, and looking for some high risk investments. I’ve got my long term investments that I’m comfortable with and I’d like to use these funds to try my luck at some higher risk plays - maybe for a few months to try and supercharge my savings (understandably, at the risk of losing it worst case). Some ideas I have: Investing in upcoming stock splits - Chipotle, Broadcom, Sony. I feel like this could be a good short-ish term play to try and capitalize on the splits. Open to thoughts on this. Other thoughts would be watching AMD as the stocks been hammered due to the alleged data breach, so keeping an eye on this and catching it during the dip could be good.

Thanks in advance!","Typically a split happening is an indicator of a healthy/profitable company. After a split is announced, there is a psychological factor to “get in before the split” because stocks post-split tend to trend upwards due to lower perceived costs.Especially for a stock like Chipotle, which is current at 3.5k per share, which is fairly inaccessible to most retail investors, after the massive split (1:50) shares will be ~$68. This lets more retail investors actually invest, causing upward movement over time.This isn’t a hard rule, though!",1,0.538,POSITIVE,0.978

Thanks in advance!",AMD and Intel aren't competing with Nvidia. Ever. Both companies have been in the graphics space for over 25 years and even after over 25 years their products are inferior to Nvidia's.  I always laugh when I see articles how Google and Microsoft are investing in AI chips to rival Nvidia's.  If companies like AMD and Intel who have been in the game for 25+ years can't compete with Nvidia what makes people think some brand new company or a new venture by Google or MS can?,0,0.602,NEGATIVE,0.654

When I hear stuff like that, I tend to think that the big companies are just buying into the process. Investing in Nvidia or TSM, getting into the supply like with an acquisition maybe. It would be silly for a company like MS to think a few billion in spending will get them a better product and a better price than just cutting a nice long term deal with Nvidia.If they REALLY wanted to try and match/beat Nvidia, they are better off teaming/buying stake in the companies you mentioned; Intel, AMD, etc...",1,0.567,NEGATIVE,1.0
