,"I note Amazon recently announced $150B investment in their data centers. Microsoft seems to also have a large investment in data centers. Nvidia seems to not only have 310 data center globally but they ship the GPU graphics chips to data center and seem to have a monopoly. From Google AI. ""Yes, Nvidia is invested in data centers. In 2023, Nvidia shipped 3.76 million graphics processing units (GPUs) to data centers, which is a 98% market share. This gives Nvidia a monopoly on the GPUs that power decision-making in AI-accelerated data centers.

That's great for stuff like delivering Netflix. AI compute is the exact opposite.That's why the AI data center darling is a converted Ethereum miner called Corweave (private company unfortunately).They incredibly jumped from one gold rush to another. They were in the business of dense GPU compute just as Ethereum switched from Proof of Work and AI ramped up.They made a landmark hosting deal with Core Scientific which is a publicly traded Bitcoin miner which would be the closest proxy bet if they keep adding more AI contracts. Other miners like Iren have smaller deals with AI firms like Poolside.You really want power dense assets that aren't currently doing AI but could transition from a lower margin business and massively reprice up.,0,0.54,NEGATIVE,0.976
