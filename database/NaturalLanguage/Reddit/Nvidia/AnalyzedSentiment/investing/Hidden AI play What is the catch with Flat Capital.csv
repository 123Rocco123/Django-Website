,"Nvidia seems to be the best AI play out there but the stock price has appreciated quite a lot already... so i was starting to look for further AI stocks. Many rising AI companies are still private, such as OpenAI, xAI etc. But what if there is a holding that is invested in some of the hottest private AI companies. I found Flat Capital with investments in xAI, Physical Intelligence, Perplexity, Harvey, DeepL, OpenAI which are leading AI players but also invested in companies such as Figma, Discord, Remote, Klarna etc... Now to my question: what am i missing here? The stock is only up 30% from last year and even down compared to 2 years ago. Is this possibly a hidden play that not many are aware of?",Everyone piling into AI.I work in tech and the jobs market just hit a new low.Either you investors are idiots and will lose a lot of money. Or you should be going massively long recruitment companies at the bottom of the market.,0,0.569,NEGATIVE,1.0
