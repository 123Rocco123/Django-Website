,"At the moment I have stocks in Amazon, Nvidia, Rheinmetall, Alphabet, Tesla and msci etf. I have earned some good margins in all (except the etf at the moment). Anyway, regarding the others who gave good margins, what does one do when this happens? Should I cash out now that they’re high thinking “yeah maybe they’ll go down” or should I hold them? And if one has to hold them, until when? Thanks.","What made you buy them in the first place? Does that situation still exist? Do you have anything you think is a better investment?And if one has to hold them, until when?You should always have ""exit criteria"" for any stock you purchase. This shouldn't be a question you are asking now.",0,0.548,NEGATIVE,1.0

The situation is still there. At the moment the only other thing I’m into is crypto. I think of these (and the etf) as long term investments. But I’m new to stocks so I just got them when they were low thankfully but not quite knowing about this exit strategy. The earnings aren’t much, maybe 700 all together.So I guess if I don’t need them now just leave them there, or maybe cash them out and get either a nice drone or BTC/ETH while they’re still low?",1,0.529,NEGATIVE,1.0

The tech stocks were a safe lazy effort, I think they’ll definitely continue to go up. Rheinmetall was kind of ideological since I believe in defense and right now is the best bet for Germany and Europe.My thoughts are still the same, except for the Tesla stock, I feel bad having it there.I think they’ll continue to rise, even for Rheinmetall too, sadly, since I would prefer world peace but that’s naive.",3,0.529,NEGATIVE,1.0

You are still in the casino with the chips, and then you have nothing but monopoly money.Go home or all-in, is your own decision.As a long-time investor, I normally sell off 30-40% gain (if I still believe in the stocks) to lock in the gain move gain to a less riskier long-term investment ETF.You sound like to move to a riskier (bit coin).. I call that.. all-in option in the casino.Might as well stay where you are if you still believe in these companies (lesser risk) vs bit coins",0,0.526,NEGATIVE,0.993

In other words you should already have a plan on when you will buy and sell before you made any investments. Your just putting money into stocks without any ideal of where they will go up or down. You need a plan and that comes with educating yourself.,0,0.536,NEGATIVE,1.0

If you held individual stock for them up until about 10 years ago, you’d be doing pretty well. Yet today it’s down a significant amount. However, the market as a whole hasn’t been hurt too badly by Boeing’s drop in share value.Picking individual stocks won’t get you more than the market, on average. You may get lucky and hit a stock that skyrockets in value, but you can also get hosed.",2,0.568,NEGATIVE,1.0
