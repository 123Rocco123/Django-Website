,"I started investing a considerable amount of money by the end of 2021. Since then, I have been learning and studying different assets and I got interested in tech stocks and ETFs, among other sectors. Right now techs represent almost 40% of my portfolio (stocks like Apple, Microsoft, Tesla or Spotify and an ETF that includes the 500 top tech US stocks) and after the AI boom I feel very exposed, even though it is not certain if we are heading to a recession nor we are in another tech bubble. I sold Nvidia a couple months ago thinking it would reverse after its huge rise and it actually continued to grow until now. What are your thoughts about this? Should I just hold it all? Or maybe it would be a good idea to check and adjust some positions to reduce my exposure until the bubble deflates (if there's such bubble)?","About 25% of SPY is also the big tech companies (microsoft + FAANG) so we're all highly exposed to them imo.Like the other commentator says, just buy SPY or some other broad etf and live peacefully.",0,0.548,0.529,POSITIVE

It's like adding salt to already-salty soup: even if most of your bowl is soup vs. the added salt, you're still making the overall mix saltier.",2,0.515,0.974,NEGATIVE

Less upside but they typically handle recessions and downturns better. Plus don’t forget demographics.

I buy stocks when I think there's value in them and profits can be taken in the future.I was looking for an answer to a VERY specific question about the techs sector, as I am now starting to reconsider my positions in this sector and if it may be a good time to sell some of them.

Companies have great scalability and recurring revenue. The sector in general will continue to thrive for decades.If you want to invest in individual companies, you need to identify the best in this sector, know what drives their business, what drives their moat, what are their avenues for growth, and you need to be able to value them and how they are valued by the market. AMZN, GOOG and NFLX for example have 3 very different business models and they are valued in very different ways. A drop in subscribers in NFLX can kill your investment thesis if you base their future growth on growing subscribers.
