,"It was my goal to get $100k into the S&P 500 by age 30. I accomplished that task back in April, and now have been stacking cash ever since. I now have roughly 35% liquid cash uninvested which is a combination of my emergency fund, potential down payment for a property or land, and vacation money. I’m comfortable having the $60k in a HYSA right now, and my plan was after getting to the $100k invested, I would build my cash reserves closer to $100k, which is where I’m at now. After that I would go back to investing heavily, possibly starting with some single stocks since I have my great $100k base in the index. But seeing names like nvidia getting hammered right now, I’m tempted to throw another $10k or $20k into some single stocks now. I’m a bit of an emotional investor so it was hard for me to do $100k in the S&P. But I’m comfortable holding that for the long term no matter what. Would it be smart to stick to my original game plan? Or fire some additional money into the market now prematurely seeing it is going down?","Maybe you should talk to the Intel guyJokes aside, if you can afford to lose most of it or have done your due diligence other than “because it went down”, then by all means",0,0.506,NEGATIVE,1.0
