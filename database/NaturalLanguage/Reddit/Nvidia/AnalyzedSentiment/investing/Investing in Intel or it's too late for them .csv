As that gap gets tighter and tighter they will continue to struggle with profit margins.I’m not a financial advisor but unless Intel starts making strides in the industry (or finds out how to consistently make more chips, shortages galore), you should probably just keep an eye on the company and not do anything crazy.Unrelated to financials but computer processor design is getting tighter and tighter on how small they make the transistors, there isn’t actually that much room left, so it would take either a complete upheaval in the way computer chips work or a big refocus into other parts of the design process for significant performance gains to be seen again.
