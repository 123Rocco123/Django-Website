,"If I invest $100k in S&P 500 right now and leave it there, with an average annual return of 10% it will take 23 years for it to become 1M. But of course for that to happen, S&P 500 has to continue to grow. By the time my 100k becomes 1M the Dow Jones would have to be 400,000 points. S&P500 has to be near 60k points. Meaning the big businesses that have market capital of over a trillion dollars would have to be in tens of trillion dollars, something that is virtually impossible. Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia all their valuation will hit a wall one day. You couldn’t have a company with market capital or 30T even if it captured all sectors.

SNP might as well slow in a couple of decades, although there is still a lot of undeveloped potential in humanity's economic activity. There are also external costs to economic activity like environmental crisis and climate, that are starting to weigh on the economy. Even covid can be seen as one, driven by the abindance of global travel, and possibly the result of biotech research leak a.k.a pollution.Some of the growth you see is consolidation, global megacorps taking business away from local smaller corps.If humanity goes to space, growth can be practically limitless for generations to come.",0,0.528,NEGATIVE,0.956

Can a new investor still make millions by investing in S&P500 long term?","The world’s stock market went from $2.5 trillion (USD) in 1980 to 111 trillion last year, which is a good rate of return though $1 from 1980 only has about 25% of its purchasing power left.Still, most of the world’s central banks have an inflation target of 2% since coming out of the 2007 recession thinking this gives them leeway on everything. That’ll likely provide boost for the indices. There will still be recessionary, inflationary, and all sorts of emergency situations though. Never totally discount a severe recession leading to a deflationary spiral or hyperinflation either. Still think the best way to fund tech (i.e. entice and reward techies to work 80-90 hrs/wk in a lab) is the stock mkt when push comes to shove.Also remember individual stocks and even sectors are not guaranteed survival (re: Lehmans, Enron - “the smartest guys in the room”, .. Sears and RadioShack). Most are invested in common stock which tends to be the last paid off in case of liquidation (bondholders and then preferred shares get paid off first).",0,0.538,NEGATIVE,0.989

Companies can buy back shares and destroy them. That could result in share price growth with no company growth.There is also no reason that an investor can't pay $1000 for something that has a value of $1. People do worse with digital coins every day.An infinite amount of money can flow into the system without companies ever getting any bigger, BUT it would reduce returns.",0,0.56,NEGATIVE,1.0
