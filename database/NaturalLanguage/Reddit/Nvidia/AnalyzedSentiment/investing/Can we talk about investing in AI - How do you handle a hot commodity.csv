As investors, we look to identify opportunities before the rest of the market does, and hopefully, if we're nimble enough, we can make some money. The subject I'm on is really the subject of HYPE around AI. Since the beginning of the year (or really since Oct), the market in ""all things AI"" has just gone crazy.

AI is going to permeate many processes in the business world. Reports are at ChatGPT is the fastest technology to a million users from introduction. Open.AI, the creator of ChatGPT, is not a public company however. Large Language Models are disruptive. Google's core business of advertising appears to have the potential to be under threat by a competitive Microsoft Bing offering that provides ""just answers"" rather than a string of links from paid advertisers as google search does. What these examples point to is the idea the our world can change quickly. Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple and similar players in China, Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, are all investing in and running experiments on identifying where AI can be monetized for their businesses. But I think these are the wrong places to look. None of these business are going to transform their core businesses to become AI-centric. So who is really AI-centric? I can think of a handful of AI chip startups that have mostly failed. I can think of a number of software companies (C3.ai, PLTR, Unity, even Adobe appears be moving in that direction). And there are a jillion software startups, but they are not really investible at this point unless you're a VC. https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-a-creative-new-world/ To me, there is only one company making money in AI at this point: Nvidia. They have a unique parallel processor that's been repurposed from PC gaming and now their machine learning business is larger than their core gaming business. They have built a platform to tackle one of the largest AI problems, self driving, and are investing in another platform, called Omniverse that uses AI to help generate and simulate digital twin virtual worlds. What makes them unique is they are investing in the basic research (digital biology, particle physics, medicine etc), and they have a moat around their hardware/software solution that appears to be keeping competition (AMD, Intel, QCOM) at bay. I've been invested in Nvidia for a while, and I was fortunate enough to initiate new positions in October, the problem with Nvidia is their valuations have now been stretched beyond reasonableness (again) by hype, for example, today's PE is 95 or something ridiculous. The question to me is whether this is a long term ride, or whether to try and time the market in or out, or push back from the table and cash in the chips? The AI hype train is just really getting rolling at what I would call the ordinary consumer level mainly due to ChatGPT. And these hype cycles will oscillate. My inclination is just stay long and bear the swings out as I've never been good at market timing. So my question is, what's your personal philosophy for managing a hot commodity? Dip in dip out? Ride up and down come hell or high water. Or maybe a hybrid where you hold a core and try and time buys and sells of smaller blocks, like dollar cost averaging up and down? Either way, AI is really just getting off the ground. This is one company making money in the space and I think they've got 10 years or more of growth ahead.","When there is a gold rush be the one to sell the shovels they said.

I can think of a handful of AI chip startups that have mostly failed. I can think of a number of software companies (C3.ai, PLTR, Unity, even Adobe appears be moving in that direction).

They have built a platform to tackle one of the largest AI problems, self driving, and are investing in another platform, called Omniverse that uses AI to help generate and simulate digital twin virtual worlds.
