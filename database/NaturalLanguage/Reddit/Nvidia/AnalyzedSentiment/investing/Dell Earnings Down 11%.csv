,"I wanted to get everyoneâ€™s take on DELL (down nearly 11% after hours.) I bought 106 shares at 130.5 during their recent run. Didnâ€™t sell today because I like their growth prospects wanted to exit around $150. The company seems solid, especially with its strength in enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure, even though consumer PC sales have been an ongoing problem. Despite this Dell has been doubling down on AI, data centers, and hybrid cloud, which I believe should set them up well for growth in 2025. They also stand to benefit from SMCIâ€™s issues and Nvidiaâ€™s Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure. With the growing focus on AI and enterprise tech, it feels like Dell could see steady, long-term growth and break out to that $150 range by Q2 2024. Thoughts? Should I continue to hold? Or sell during the holiday rally? My portfolio time horizon is short giving I plan to liquidate July 2024 to buy a house.","If you plan to liquidate in July 2024 you better sell yesterday... But seriously, assuming 2025, just sell everything with solid profits at least. Trump will be a WILD ride and it's really 50-50 if you're going to miss a bull run or a massive selloff when the reality of tariffs start to set in or whatever else may happen.

It's my ""gamble money"" to some extent though for sure. Short term market plays typically are.I simply wanted to answer your question though. You have to realize not every investment is always a long term play. Day traders exist for example and do this type of thing all the time. Capitalizing on folks emotions and the hype and getting out. Not really my personal main investment style, but I do ""get"" why folks may make certain moves. Different investment styles work for different folks and just because they choose to lock in certain gains at a certain price doesn't make them emotional.

I have my doubts they are going to adapt, and this market is ripe for someone more nimble to come in and beat the pants off of them.
