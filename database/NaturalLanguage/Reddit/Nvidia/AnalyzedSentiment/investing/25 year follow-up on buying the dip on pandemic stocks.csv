,"I bought the dip on several 'pandemic stocks' that had significant declines (70%+) in 2022 and started sharing public updates 1-2 times a year. In Q3 2023 I began reallocating into AI-related stocks when I developed strong conviction. I'm also working on a self-funded AI startup, which keeps me in the loop on AI. Returns have been strong and continue to give me the runway to work on my startup and support my family after leaving my corporate tech job. There's more context in my previous updates linked below. Previous updates: 1 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks 1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks 2 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks Progress updates Below are the returns for this portfolio (opened in 2022) as of December 2024.

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects. In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off. To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change. Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation. Unrealized (current investments) Meta (META): +367.97% Nvidia (NVDA): +117.05% Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up ~200% since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months. These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it. Rate of return (IRR) My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is 73.6%. Investment thesis See a summary of my investment thesis in a previous update. TL;DR: “…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways. The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the ~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among other things.” - 1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks, Nov. 2023 Nvidia's dominance I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations: Nvidia is founder-led and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies. It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage. This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now). Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. We still underestimate the AI opportunity Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find. We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before. Final thoughts I'm still well within the 'maybe I'm just lucky' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of my last update I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from. I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025. UPDATE: Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024).

,"I bought the dip on several 'pandemic stocks' that had significant declines (70%+) in 2022 and started sharing public updates 1-2 times a year. In Q3 2023 I began reallocating into AI-related stocks when I developed strong conviction. I'm also working on a self-funded AI startup, which keeps me in the loop on AI.

The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the ~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade.

It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage. This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now). Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. We still underestimate the AI opportunity Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among other things.” - 1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks, Nov. 2023 Nvidia's dominance I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations: Nvidia is founder-led and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies. It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage. This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now). Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. We still underestimate the AI opportunity Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find. We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before. Final thoughts I'm still well within the 'maybe I'm just lucky' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of my last update I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from. I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage. This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now). Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. We still underestimate the AI opportunity Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find. We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

But some examples of things that'd change my mind about the future (and would prompt an underwear change 💩😆):Nvidia: They are no longer supply constrained, particularly if it's due to something pointing to permanently reduced demand like significantly limited returns from GPU scaling.Meta: They stop seeing returns from implementing AI in ads and see an extended period of reduced or stagnant impression growth resulting in increasingly higher ad prices (counterintuitive, but points to limited future opportunities). Another one might be Apple launching a new wearable that's comparable to Meta's Orion, which points to Apple owning the next platform paradigm, like they did with the iPhone. Another might be some regulation around AI that outlaws their Llama model.It could be a number of things, but more broadly anything that meaningfully points to AI not being the meaningful trend I think it is. That's not to say there won't be bubbles, busts or that Nvidia/Meta won't have meaningful short-term corrections, but that happens -- I've been investing long enough to be comfortable with those.What are you buying today?Today I actually bought a small amount of SMCI again since they dropped due to the Nasdaq delisting and are still depressed from issues due to their reporting.But it’s risky since things still seem fishy and it’s more akin to gambling than I’m typically comfortable with, so I only purchased small amount.I decided to take a chance since their sales still seem strong, but doubt I’ll hold it long term since it’s not a high conviction bet for me, I'm just playing the short-term volatility after watching it for months.I don't have any plans to buy anything else, but I rarely do. I mostly just trade based on whenever I get new information or valuations change enough to buy/sell, which is unpredictable. I generally don't trade very often, so buying SMCI to hold short-term is unusual for me.",3,0.534,NEGATIVE,1.0

Rate of return (IRR) My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is 73.6%. Investment thesis See a summary of my investment thesis in a previous update. TL;DR: “…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways. The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the ~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among other things.” - 1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks, Nov. 2023 Nvidia's dominance I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations: Nvidia is founder-led and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies. It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage. This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now). Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. We still underestimate the AI opportunity Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find. We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before. Final thoughts I'm still well within the 'maybe I'm just lucky' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of my last update I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from. I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

TL;DR: “…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways. The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the ~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among other things.” - 1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks, Nov. 2023 Nvidia's dominance I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations: Nvidia is founder-led and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies. It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage. This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now). Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. We still underestimate the AI opportunity Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find. We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before. Final thoughts I'm still well within the 'maybe I'm just lucky' phase since it's only been a couple years.

This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.

The 'ChatGPT moment' when AI entered the public consciousness and investment meaningfully increased was ~2 years ago.Given past technological advancements, do we think we're near the end of what possible after two years or the beginning?That's where I'd start. Working in the industry, talking to folks and watching what others are building reinforces this. For example, just about every scientist and research I've talking to is excited because we're just scratching the surface of what's possible.For consumer examples, look at the videos Sora is creating (I recently got access to it). It has a long way to go, but I can imagine the possibilities. For example, imagine coming home and wanting to watch a new sequel of <your favorite franchise here>, but on a different timeline/scenario and just asking AI to generate it. How much would you pay for that? What about for a custom, fully immersive VR video game?And that's just the world of bits. Move to the world of atoms and imagine robots trained to fix/build anything and do anything around the home, to train you how to improve your swing, etc. What if you could learn anything with a dedicated tutor? That's all possible with AI. How much economic value is that in the US and around the world?I use it multiple times a day, every day. It's great, but still has a lot to improve on even in the scope of daily life. But as it becomes better, faster and cheaper it'll increase by orders of magnitude in usefulness.",1,0.532,NEGATIVE,0.599

Still bigger than GCP and Azure I think, though I believe Azure might be seeing more AI demand due to OpenAI? Either way, you have an incredible vantage point on the industry.This might be true, but o1 has shown us new opportunities for scaling. We still may also see improvements to pre-training with more scale, synthetic data, etc. but I'm not holding my breath for that. However, I do expect improvements with efficiency and optimization of models. Suffice to say that scaling compute isn't the only way to improve.I'm also excited because I believe we've barely scratched the surface of where we can even implement the current state of AI into the existing economy. E.g. let's assume AI models don't improve at all, there's still 5+ years of progress we could make by efficiently implementing what we have today -- especially as more people get better at understanding how to use it. Though this would shift the focus to inference from training and have implications, but I'm still optimistic.In a nutshell given that AI is effectively intelligence, my core assumption is that we're more likely to underestimate the impact than overestimate it -- especially given Nvidia's still reasonable P/E ratio (51 as of right now) with supply constraints.We shall see.

It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage. This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now). Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. We still underestimate the AI opportunity Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find. We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

,"I bought the dip on several 'pandemic stocks' that had significant declines (70%+) in 2022 and started sharing public updates 1-2 times a year. In Q3 2023 I began reallocating into AI-related stocks when I developed strong conviction. I'm also working on a self-funded AI startup, which keeps me in the loop on AI. Returns have been strong and continue to give me the runway to work on my startup and support my family after leaving my corporate tech job. There's more context in my previous updates linked below.

The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the ~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among other things.” - 1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks, Nov. 2023 Nvidia's dominance I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations: Nvidia is founder-led and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies. It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage. This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now). Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. We still underestimate the AI opportunity Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find. We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before. Final thoughts I'm still well within the 'maybe I'm just lucky' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of my last update I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from. I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage. This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now). Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now). Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. We still underestimate the AI opportunity Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find. We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

A lot of the hyperscalers (e.g. Amazon) have mentioned their own ambitions to build their own GPUs. These hyperscalers also happen to be big cutsomers of Nvidia. What are your thoughts on hyperscalers developing their own hardware and competing with Nvidia? Congrats on your results btw. A lot of good names in the portfolio,0,0.538,POSITIVE,0.997

Amazon for example now has their Trainum 2 chips in GA promising better price performance, whith Trainium 3 chips coming next summer. This will cut into Nvidia's market share at the low end, as AWS' goal is always to commoditize infra. Google also has its own TPUs it uses.But they and all other hyperscalers still use Nvidia's GPUs as well due to the unmatched versatility and ecosystem. Where the balance settles is still a big question.The more negative case for Nvidia is if somehow we reach the limits GPU scaling on all fronts (e.g. even o1's economics don't scale, which is unlikely), in which case GPUs become more commoditized to the extent that the other aspects of their moat (CUDA, ecosystem, networking, etc.) can't make up for it.However, I don't think that is the case. I'm also curious how large sovereign AI becomes in the coming years.Long-term I'd expect Nvidia's market share to settle around ~70% (from ~90% today for datacenter AI GPUs). But even if competitors catch up and it drops to 50% I believe the market will be massive enough to achieve attractive returns.",1,0.544,NEGATIVE,0.999

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects. In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off. To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change. Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation. Unrealized (current investments) Meta (META): +367.97% Nvidia (NVDA): +117.05% Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up ~200% since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months. These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it. Rate of return (IRR) My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is 73.6%. Investment thesis See a summary of my investment thesis in a previous update. TL;DR: “…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways. The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the ~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among other things.” - 1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks, Nov. 2023 Nvidia's dominance I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations: Nvidia is founder-led and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies. It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage. This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now). Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. We still underestimate the AI opportunity Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find. We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before. Final thoughts I'm still well within the 'maybe I'm just lucky' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of my last update I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from. I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

He has really strong analysis that helped me see through the market noise (voting machine vs. weighing machine) and make clear headed investment decisions on those.My biggest regret is not following through on buying Nvidia in late 2022 at its bottom before the AI boom after he analyzed its prospects. This is after I had already went all-in on the pandemic stocks, thus didn't have a lot of extra cash at the time. About a year later is when I started selling the pandemic stocks to buy Nvidia and other AI stocks.What I love most about his analysis is that he's not a stock picker, which keeps his analysis clear and unbiased.

,"I bought the dip on several 'pandemic stocks' that had significant declines (70%+) in 2022 and started sharing public updates 1-2 times a year. In Q3 2023 I began reallocating into AI-related stocks when I developed strong conviction. I'm also working on a self-funded AI startup, which keeps me in the loop on AI.

The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the ~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade.

It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage. This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now). Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. We still underestimate the AI opportunity Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find. We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now). Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints. We still underestimate the AI opportunity Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find. We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before. Final thoughts I'm still well within the 'maybe I'm just lucky' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of my last update I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from. I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025. UPDATE: Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024). For an apples to apples comparison, the IRR of QQQ and S&P 500 respectively during this period were ~16% and ~24%.",Congrats! Great job.Thoughts on ASML?,0,0.507,POSITIVE,1.0
,"I bought the dip on several 'pandemic stocks' that had significant declines (70%+) in 2022 and started sharing public updates 1-2 times a year. In Q3 2023 I began reallocating into AI-related stocks when I developed strong conviction. I'm also working on a self-funded AI startup, which keeps me in the loop on AI. Returns have been strong and continue to give me the runway to work on my startup and support my family after leaving my corporate tech job. There's more context in my previous updates linked below.

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects. In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks.

TL;DR: “…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables).

The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the ~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade.

A quote from his article TSMC Earnings, Margins and Arizona, ASML and Peak Lithography:That leaves TSMC and its upcoming investment at 2nm and 16A, which is a challenge for ASML for three reasons. First, there is the aforementioned shift in TSMC’s model; repurposing equipment likely means fewer lithography orders. Second, while ASML may have a monopoly on advanced lithography, TSMC is poised to have monopsony power in terms of being able to actually make money on processes that utilize ASML’s advanced lithography, which may depress prices (this is the third factor that could help TSMC’s margins). The third challenge is that we are past peak lithography.From Doug O’Laughlin at Fabricated Knowledge:Another way to interrupt this statement is that EUV intensity is peaked if they think the DUV attach rate is growing as fast as EUV. This has been a long time coming, and Applied Materials puts it well in this slide – 3nm is the apex of lithography market share gains. This is not good for ASML and the EUV story....The last decade has been the decade of Lithography, and I can almost assure you that Lithography spending will grow slower in the next decade than WFE [Wafer Fab Equipment]. And let’s not forget that in the decade before EUV, lithography was only 15-20% of the expenditure. I believe that lithography will revert to the mid-20s of WFE.I think it’s time for investors to accept the decade of lithography is over. The premium ASML has slowly gained for itself for the last decade should end as the decade of litho ends. And the recent price move has been a collapse of that premium. I believe it should trade in line with other semi-cap companies, as I’m sure that Litho will not outgrow WFE but will be valued for its strong monopoly.It's still continue to be a good business, but not a great one that is likely to produce outsized returns.",1,0.525,NEGATIVE,1.0
