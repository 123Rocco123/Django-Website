,"This is a big quote from MarketWatch. I’ve seen the numbers before, but this really gave me pause. These captains of the SS S&P 500 are Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla. They've been described as the magnificent seven by many news organizations. Fortunately for me, there's a common thread among this group. They are the only U.S. companies that have ever been valued at a trillion dollars by the public markets. To say these companies are dominating the S&P 500 is a giant understatement. Last year, their collective valuation gained more than $5 trillion. Compare that to the S&P 500's valuation gain of less than $8 trillion. That means the trillionaires were responsible for roughly 65% of the Index's market cap gain last year, despite comprising just 1.4% of its components. But doesn't this go against the main reason behind investing in S&P 500 index funds? Wouldn't the entire index be susceptible to a massive drop if just one of these seven companies failed? Phil Van Dorn: Well, I like index funds because they spread out your risk over many stocks and because the expenses are so low. In the mutual fund industry, traditionally, you might be looking at expenses of 1% of assets under management per year, and that can really pile up over time. But with an S&P 500 Index Fund, your expenses get close to zero. But as you have mentioned when you called the group of expensive stocks the Trillionaires' Club, a small group of companies now make up between 27 and 30% of the S&P 500 depending on which day you look at it. Jeremy Owens: Right, so that's seven out of 500 companies accounting for more than a quarter or less than a third of the entire market cap of the S&P 500 and really swaying the underlying metrics. What should an investor kind of take from this and how should we look at the S&P 500 moving forward, knowing how much these companies matter? Phil Van Dorn: One can say that there's a heck of a lot of risk in the seven companies that make up only 1% of the S&P 500, but make up close to a third of its value. However, the S&P 500 is self-correcting. It rewards success.","There is a lot of misunderstanding associated with this.Market cap means they have more weight in market movement. That is well understood.What is often incorrectly taken away is that the narrowness of cap weight and truth that this small number of stocks are responsible for so much of the total index gain, means that the broad market isn’t also growing or up, participation is narrow, etc. A common view presented is “index minus mag 7”, which is basically saying, “hey, we’re going to pull out heavy upward weight, while leaving in everything else including heaviest weight underperformers.” That is obviously going to create a skewed picture.This is a good way to understand cap weight, but it is a terrible thing to use to form conclusions about participation/breadth.",0,0.522,1.0,NEGATIVE

,"This is a big quote from MarketWatch. I’ve seen the numbers before, but this really gave me pause. These captains of the SS S&P 500 are Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla. They've been described as the magnificent seven by many news organizations. Fortunately for me, there's a common thread among this group. They are the only U.S. companies that have ever been valued at a trillion dollars by the public markets. To say these companies are dominating the S&P 500 is a giant understatement. Last year, their collective valuation gained more than $5 trillion. Compare that to the S&P 500's valuation gain of less than $8 trillion. That means the trillionaires were responsible for roughly 65% of the Index's market cap gain last year, despite comprising just 1.4% of its components. But doesn't this go against the main reason behind investing in S&P 500 index funds? Wouldn't the entire index be susceptible to a massive drop if just one of these seven companies failed? Phil Van Dorn: Well, I like index funds because they spread out your risk over many stocks and because the expenses are so low. In the mutual fund industry, traditionally, you might be looking at expenses of 1% of assets under management per year, and that can really pile up over time. But with an S&P 500 Index Fund, your expenses get close to zero. But as you have mentioned when you called the group of expensive stocks the Trillionaires' Club, a small group of companies now make up between 27 and 30% of the S&P 500 depending on which day you look at it.

But post 911 airlines went to near zero. We’ve had enormous utilities like Pge and Edison almost get wiped out in a quarter. The banking collapse wiped out companies left and right. Covid decimated tons of industries.So, no, any company of any size can fail and fail unbelievably fast. It has happened as a matter of course for as long as there have been companies and investing. If you’re hinting that trillion market cap makes you immune, I simply don’t agree.But, you know, it’s nothing personal. Can’t get tone on web.YEARS ago I would day trade banking stocks. my point was that they were too big to fail. If they ever tanked I was sure the fed would bail them out. BUT I got tired of it and stopped. A few years later the banking collapse happened and if I had still been playing, I woulda lost a fortune. You had the biggest banks in the us down to near bankruptcy “overnight.”So I had relied on the sentiment you’re repeating here (because it seems logical) and from experience it didn’t pan out and could have really hurt me.Just cautioning based on hard won experience.

They are the only U.S. companies that have ever been valued at a trillion dollars by the public markets. To say these companies are dominating the S&P 500 is a giant understatement. Last year, their collective valuation gained more than $5 trillion. Compare that to the S&P 500's valuation gain of less than $8 trillion. That means the trillionaires were responsible for roughly 65% of the Index's market cap gain last year, despite comprising just 1.4% of its components. But doesn't this go against the main reason behind investing in S&P 500 index funds? Wouldn't the entire index be susceptible to a massive drop if just one of these seven companies failed? Phil Van Dorn: Well, I like index funds because they spread out your risk over many stocks and because the expenses are so low. In the mutual fund industry, traditionally, you might be looking at expenses of 1% of assets under management per year, and that can really pile up over time. But with an S&P 500 Index Fund, your expenses get close to zero. But as you have mentioned when you called the group of expensive stocks the Trillionaires' Club, a small group of companies now make up between 27 and 30% of the S&P 500 depending on which day you look at it. Jeremy Owens: Right, so that's seven out of 500 companies accounting for more than a quarter or less than a third of the entire market cap of the S&P 500 and really swaying the underlying metrics. What should an investor kind of take from this and how should we look at the S&P 500 moving forward, knowing how much these companies matter? Phil Van Dorn: One can say that there's a heck of a lot of risk in the seven companies that make up only 1% of the S&P 500, but make up close to a third of its value.

I think Microsoft will also do well with AI but you really have to wonder about their lack of vision. Google started the TPUs over a decade ago and in the open and not secret.
