,"Hello everyone. Considering how fast NVIDIA ran up in value this week, what are you guys thinking about Dell? Since the past few earnings reports, they have consistently beaten analyst predictions. What do you guys think? Is it a good buy for short term profit from the earnings report?",They have different overhead and make different products. They may be in the same “industry” but it would be tough to compare them.,0,0.526,NEGATIVE,0.991

What do you guys think? Is it a good buy for short term profit from the earnings report?",I used “quotes” that you ignored. They are both in the electronic hardware industry.It’s like comparing Sony to Intel or AMD to Logitech. They all have the same supply chain issues.,2,0.557,NEGATIVE,1.0
,"Hello everyone. Considering how fast NVIDIA ran up in value this week, what are you guys thinking about Dell? Since the past few earnings reports, they have consistently beaten analyst predictions. What do you guys think? Is it a good buy for short term profit from the earnings report?",Dell and Nvidia are not comparable. NVIDIAs dominance in GPU design should in no way influence your opinion of Dell.,0,0.527,NEGATIVE,1.0

What do you guys think? Is it a good buy for short term profit from the earnings report?","Earnings expectations are mostly priced in. But the medium term is where the money is with DELL. There is zero chance that server makers as a group will not grow in the next couple years. But sure, if they really surprise, they will jump, and if they only meet expectations, they will dip.",0,0.544,NEGATIVE,0.997

What do you guys think? Is it a good buy for short term profit from the earnings report?","They are pretty well valued for the moment, but they'll pullback. SMCI; PSTG and NTAP will pull back. And if the medium- to long-term continue to look increasingly bullish any one of them is worth consideration.",1,0.53,NEGATIVE,0.999

,"Hello everyone. Considering how fast NVIDIA ran up in value this week, what are you guys thinking about Dell? Since the past few earnings reports, they have consistently beaten analyst predictions. What do you guys think? Is it a good buy for short term profit from the earnings report?","Its share price has gone up to so high and can't deliver the expected result to impress investors. Simple as that. If the momentum doesn't show that it can grow like Nvidia, the recent surge of share price simply won't be justified as expected growth in EPS won't be there. Afterall, it is just a hardware distributor who doesn't own the technology of hardware, unlike Nvidia in chips and Microsoft in AI. Having a network of clients would be valuable but shouldnt be a skyhigh valuation in just a matter of months. I personally going bearish on Dell.",0,0.555,NEGATIVE,1.0
