I still like apple around 120, but that's more for dividends and lower risk.I would look into sustainable everything. I'm a big fan of companies that use wood, so cardboard, packaging, stuff like that. Single use plastic bans have to be coming, and there will be new technology that helps create plant based plastics. These companies can very easily grow their market share. Aluminum is somewhere I'm holding as well. although most of those companies are mature (IP, ball, crown holdings). But I think there's still growth left, especially if plastic bottles start getting banned. And there's room in the market (barring recession) for smaller companies to gain substantial market shareI'm on the fence about renewable energy companies, a lot of them seem overpriced, and I think it will be government entities that end up with the major piece of the pie.

Cloud computing is estimated to have a $1.4T Total Addressable Market by 2030. If net margins remain 30%+ (probably will given the cost structure and oligopoly nature), then that’s about $400B dollars worth of profit the big 3 will bring in. The recent situation with Southwest is a good example of companies that still need to migrate their services to the cloud eventually, instead of boomer management relying on outdated technology and treating IT as a business cost instead of an investment growth opportunity.ChatGPT, while it should be monitored is far from affecting Google’s moat currently. ChatGPT is useful right now specifically for specific quantitative and programming based questions being solved. Google is way better for qualitative information (although chatGPT does write sophisticatedly well enough to use for a cover letter lol). Anyway, Google invented the GPT Transformer which is what chatGPT is. If chatGPT really is a commercial success then Google will release their own version and gain market share. Similar to how Instagram copied Snapchat stories and made Snapchat obsolete.Google also has future potential with YouTube TV. They just landed NFL Sunday Ticket. They’re making a push in cable.Microsoft is very entrenched in the enterprise world and that encourages companies to migrate to their cloud services to make it seamless with the office 365 suites.Amazon has dominating market share in Cloud, and there’s no indication they’ll cede to Microsoft and Google in the near future. There are some growing pains with too much CAPEX spending during the Covid boom. But that will be sorted out in a few years once that shock is over and done with (inflation stabilizes, interest rates stabilize).Other non-cloud companies to consider:CVS is another underrated player. They acquired Aetna in 2018, and have paid down issued debt sufficiently enough that they’re resuming dividend increases and share buybacks (inflation really made the Aetna acquisition cheaper. CVS lucked out on timing). CVS is a pretty vertically integrated healthcare company now. They’re in an oligopoly with Walgreens and rite aid for retail prescriptions. They own 90% of the PBM industry (CVS Caremark) which is the middle-man for negotiating drug prices between big pharma and retail. $UNH has notoriously performed the market since the 90s with a 20% annual return, so health insurance has performed very well as an investment in recent decades.You can chase potentially more upside from companies like Meta and Tesla. But there is less certainty surrounding their future business. In terms of risk-adjusted returns, the 4 I mentioned above are some of the best investments given their current valuations, economic moats, and future expectations. The only risk between those 4 I mentioned above are anti-trust & cybersecurity, and Medicare for all legislation. I don’t see those risks materializing currently",0,0.534,0.76,POSITIVE

If you look how rapidly the installed capacity is increasing year over year - exponential for PV; almost exponential for wind - then it's hard to see how they cannot make a mint if they are profitable at all. The US and Europe are aiming to have local manufacture for more independence from China - so 'failsafe' (read subsidies guaranteed).Food. Anyone who has a solution for securing food supplies in a world with increasing droughts and other extreme weather phenomena will be in a good position to capitalize on that. This may not be as noticeable in the next 5 years, but I'm thinking within the 5-10 year timeline we'll see some big players emerge in the vertical farming space (and there will be subsidies aplenty.

Some people say it could even be a Google killer.Google's revenue is from targetted advertising. The things ChatGPT are good for are usually not good for targetted ads. Besides, don't assume there is some massive gap and Google can't reproduce those results. First to market doesn't guarantee market leader. They have to remain the most compelling offering.Apple has AR and VR headsets in the works, which I think could either be a huge success, a complete flop, or anything in between. Apple pay seems promising and could eventually complete with Amazon if they play their cards right.I think we're still quite a ways away from them taking off, and that it requires them becoming inobtrusive and actually useful. Not this metaverse web3.0 bullshit.Apple pay seems promising and could eventually complete with Amazon if they play their cards right.With Amazon? No. With Visa and Mastercard. If Apple and Google remove that layer there's a lot of money up for grabs in payment processing.Tesla seems to be heading for mediocrity, once the other automakers start releasing EVs.They have a huge lead and a lot of that is vertical integration. The other automakers have barely caught up to where Tesla was 10 years ago, and they're still relying on others to solve the battery and materials problem, the charging problem, etc. If Tesla stagnates then they will have a problem. If they continue innovating, and start licensing when it becomes inevitable that's the only way to keep up with them, they can profit huge. For example look at charging. Electrify America is the only real competitor to Tesla's Superchargers, and that was being built as punishment for dieselgate. Its not at this time a profit center and they don't give a shit about it. It will fall into disrepair if it does not become a money maker. Which with the relative lack of non Tesla EV's on the road will come soon if that doesn't change. Which brings us to batteries.Tesla already has struggled to get enough batteries for their own use and are the largest purchaser of cells in the world. That supply simply doesn't exist for GM or Ford to churn out as many EVs as Tesla does. If Tesla were to maintain a stranglehold on supply, since unlike Ford and GM they're vertically integrating well into that, they could create a situation where Ford and GM have to buy their excess. If they were to discover or acquire a major breakthrough in battery tech once again everyone else would have to license from them.Same goes for Autopilot.So no you can't just write them off. It all depends on if they continue to innovate and iterate the way they have since inception.Meta’s current PE ratio of 11 looks very interesting, but everyone hates them.I think VR is a folly and Zuck is fucking them up.

Over time, most of the time, prices approximate some kind of value with some kind of intrinsicality. But there are issues. EMH is an elegant academic concept. It's beautiful math, and lets you define risk purely as volatility. But just like in thermodynamics, you will never have 100% efficiency in real life. Otherwise, there would be no value bubbles and fundamentals would rule. Don't get me wrong, I am a big believer in low-cost broad index funds as a retirement core. Bogle's ideas are terrific for most investors. But emotion runs the market. And emotion can be exploited. The worst thing any investor can have is sentiment toward a security. I've worked in funds and in VC valuation, and there is nothing about building a decent DCF and examining fundamentals that a person with a HS education cannot learn. And while stupid money chases gains and locks in losses, some savvy home investors who have trained themselves well (and never have to pay hefty fund expense ratios) have built nice portfolios of indexes and stocks and outperformed the market over time. Unlike a fund manager, they only care about their own time horizon and are not chasing quick gains to save their job in a bear. They're not the average investor.

But intelligence is not what differentiates strong investors. Read my post carefully next time. Notice how I am discussing investors who are NOT average. Avergae jnvestors are mostly bad momentum trader wannabes who know just enough to put it in the wrong place at the wrong time. And I am talking about portfolios, not active funds. Active funds are for those who are too weak to fight their broker and give in to the sales pressure, or don't know any better. There is a lot more to investing than minimizing cost and maximizing diversification.
