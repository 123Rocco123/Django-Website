A great deal of their growth is priced in, they're not going to 10x again and be a 25T marketcap company any time soon. I'm holding expecting that their growth will plateau as hardware commoditization starts to take effect in the AI chip space, but they will be able to grow into this valuation and become a solid blue chip dividend hold over the long term.AMD at these levels is much more exciting as a growth play than NVDA at these levels, they have much more upside potential. They carry greater risk as it is still not entirely clear how successful they will be in growing into AI compute (I'm bullish especially on the inference side, especially after the xilinx acquistion. A good buddy of mine who studied physics with me works on their fgpa team and they've got some great tech).I also think the market is discounting AMD because we have so many retail investors in the space now with no understanding of the technology who are just buying the name brands, or people who don't read financial statements and don't understand metrics making decisions like ""urrrr p/e 200 it bad."" These people will get washed out of the market at some point and we should see some expansion out of the fomo names into strong competitors as they continue to make more substantial product and business gains.",5,0.558,NEGATIVE,0.999

Intel's 13900K and 14900K processors (their current Core series flagship chips) are having some serious stability issues and the older and cheaper AMD 7950X3D chips are often on-par or slightly faster anyway.This is extra-bad timing for Intel as they work towards releasing their 15th gen chips with a brand new socket in 2025 while AMD has guaranteed AM5 socket support through ""2027+"" and will supposedly be launching the Ryzen 9000 series at the end of July.",3,0.561,NEGATIVE,1.0

Their chips typically have more cores than intel chips making multitasking better and is beneficial for programs with high demand. I now consider AMD chips slightly better than Intel chips. I consider buying both depending on the price-to-performance ratio. Typically I find AMD leading in that area. When it comes to GPU Nvidia I still believe to be better but I don't believe we are talking about a massive difference. But their GPUs are very well-priced when compared to NVIDIA. Yes, you can make the argument they are better but typically there is a price difference to make up for that so the value is there. I also much prefer a higher V-Ram in a graphics card over ray tracing. Would it be nice to have both? Of course.
