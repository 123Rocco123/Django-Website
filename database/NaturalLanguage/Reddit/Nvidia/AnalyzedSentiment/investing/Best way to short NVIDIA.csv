If NVDA will dump. It will probably be to surprise bad earnings. That being said, the safest way is to DCA NVDS shares then sell covered options on them.Because the trend is up, you can be risky and sell near the money far out exp covered call contracts on them, all the way to next earnings. This will net good premiums. You will have to do the math and look at oi and option chain put walls and set your contracts there.When the contracts expire before earnings. You take the premiums for selling the covered calls and buy a put option on the underlying NVDA for basically free.NVDS is at $8. I would buy 100 shares and sell a covered call @ $15 strike to a date just before earnings.I would take some money and pre DCA by selling put options at $4 and $2 prior to earnings as well.When earnings happen I personally will buy a call and a put option because the market will probably get the IV wrong because the market will overreact.Dont pay attention to ""throwing your money away"" bros. They don't believe people taking profits or that companies can miss. They said the same shit about metaverse.",0,0.552,1.0,NEGATIVE
