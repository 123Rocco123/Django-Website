,"Hello guys, I'm from Germany, and we start something like an apprenticeship for 3 years at the age of 16. You work 40h a week though you alternate between work and a school meant to combine theory and practice and prepare you for an actual job in the field you did the apprenticeship in. My employer offers capital accumulation benefits of 40€/$44 a month. I've decided to put this,essentially,free money into an investment fund. As I am gonna be working in the banking industry,I don't gave to pay any additional fees to a investment fund including a stock depot,if that's the right word. I am using the UniGlobal offer. Over the course of at least 6 years,these 40 euros go to the fund,which picks and buys stocks of different branches,something like ETFs. Right now, 70% of all stocks bought come from the IT branch, so from companies like Apple,Amazon,NVIDIA etc. What stocks are bought are influenced by worldly events,so during the covid epidemic,mostly Medical and Pharmaceutical stocks were getting bought. After 6 years of paying in, I can freely access the depot and do whatever I want with the money. I can keep putting money in or sell everything off,though I will probably do the former. My question is if you guys think that this is a good choice, as my only other 2 options were putting the money into a retirement account/fund or a savings contract. There is obviously risk involved but i am confident in it working out for the better. I ak still pretty young and would appreciate others' opinions on this. Thanks.","As you are young, you can actually bear more risks than sb close to retirement. So would go for the stock option. Any alternative to an actively managed fund available?",0,0.53,NEGATIVE,0.993

Thanks.","32 from Germany, I had my Vermögenswirksame Leistung always in a Bausparvertrag, because sadly etf or fonds where not available back then or I didnt know better. Luckily due to the time when I did that I can get a mortage for a house below 1% now. At your age id put it in that etf like thing - and forget about it for the next years.
