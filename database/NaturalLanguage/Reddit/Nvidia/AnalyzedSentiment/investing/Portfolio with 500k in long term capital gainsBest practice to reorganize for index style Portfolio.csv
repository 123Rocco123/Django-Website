,"To make a long story short I am receiving a distribution from a trust that has around 500k in long term capital gains. The portfolio has roughly 60 different stocks. The majority of the gains are in nvidia, msft, big tech stocks. I want to sell everything and move into a 3 fund portfolio. I don't mind keeping the nvidia and maybe a couple others. Would you just bite the bullet and sell and pay the taxes or sell off 3k in gains and loses per year to offset each other?",why?,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.979

It’s possible the trust was designed to be kept out of the estate for a second to die spouse. And therefore would not receive a second step up. Surviving spouse likely received income and had HEMS provisions and then the trust distributed to financial beneficiaries upon the surviving spouses death.,1,0.516,NEGATIVE,0.999

First to die simply changes ownership to the spouse and everything else, including any (dividend) income, continues as before. Surviving spouse can even sell the assets, pay capital gains, and use the proceeds. Surviving spouse passing triggers distribution to people named in trust and said people receive proceeds of estate on a stepped up basis.This is how our revocable trust is written. Like I said, if the trust is written properly.",2,0.541,NEGATIVE,0.965

You can use any amount of losses to offset any amount of gains. The $3k limit only applies to using losses to offset ordinary income.I would take a look at how many losses and how many gains you have to get an idea of the actual taxes you'd owe. You are likely going to have to pay 15% on the capital gains no matter what, but if you can avoid getting into the 20% bracket, that would be ideal.Frankly, you're probably at a level where you'd benefit from a discussion with a cpa rather than randos on reddit...",0,0.519,NEGATIVE,1.0

I was conflating simplification for simplification’s sake (without considering the impact of taxes) as “getting religion” (referring to religious advocates of 3 fund portfolios).I was suggesting, instead of realizing $500K of gains, that if the person was actively contributing, that they could merge their existing stocks into a direct indexing solution to form an index equivalent, less existing assets, and fill in the gaps over time.Example: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/build-around-existing-positions-direct-165215084.html",2,0.516,NEGATIVE,1.0

There are typically accredited investor requirements to participate in private placements but you can also look into a private placement called an Exchange Fund. Direct indexing will take a long time to migrate in a tax efficient manner. In my experience direct indexing works best with new cash invested.,0,0.539,NEGATIVE,0.761
