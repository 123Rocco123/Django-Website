The big risk is the valuation at 12x sales without enough operating profit visibility.","I don't have an opinion about the stock.But my initial reaction when I see Gitlab describe themselves as an ""AI-powered DevSecOps Platform"" is that they must really be struggling to compete if they are resorting to appealing to companies in that manner.",0,0.547,NEGATIVE,0.998

Gitlab lacks a lot of convenient features, for example, I think you still can't leave review comments on file level. Or sending review comments in batches, I think it was added very recently, like 1.5 years ago, and before that it was incredibly spammy. The amount of downtime is also much higher than GitHub's",2,0.523,NEGATIVE,0.979
