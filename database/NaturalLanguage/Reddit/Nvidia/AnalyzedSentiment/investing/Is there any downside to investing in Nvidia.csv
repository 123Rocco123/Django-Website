Remember few years back when everyone thought everyone will have an electric car and everyone bragged about how far behind other manufacturers were behind Tesla. Well after few years everyone caught up and Tesla fell.In my opinion the same will happen to NVDA. I will wait for few months to test this thesis though before buying some puts.

Teslas similar to other car manufacturers experienced declining sales due to high interest rate and slow downof consumer spending. NVDA products at least their data centre products aren’t being bought by average consumer . The AI data center build up started last year this is 16 -18 months in and should continue next few quarters. AMD , INTL or ARM haven’t released anything that comes close to NVDA hardware and software stack. Will there be competition down the road maybe … right now no one even comes close. NVDA valuation is already way over priced, but just like last quarter it won’t stop new money from flowing in.",2,0.554,NEGATIVE,1.0

That’s been the mantra of investing for at least half a century. The CEO does everything and the 50,000 highly skilled workers are just fluff.But anyway, in this case it matters a lot.

Taiwan depends in inputs from Amersterdam, and the US and vice versa.If one link in the chain is broken we don't get chips.China will invade Taiwan. They have nothing to lose. They've got 60,000,000 more males than females all military age. Even worse, the young women are so in demand that they are waiting for even better offers from men and thus are aging out of their reproductive windows.China won't have the manpower for a sustained conflict after 2027 and they'll be lucky to hold together as a single country by 2030. Projected population is 500,000,000 by 2050 and that's without war or mass starvation. Now civil war is a real threat and nationalism from a war against Taiwan is the cure.Anyway, yes, lots of risk with invidia and any company with significant investment in China. Yes, I'm talking about TESLA. Guaranteed nationalized if war with US breaks out.",0,0.534,NEGATIVE,1.0

Someone must lose in order for an economy to function.,"There is no question that NVDA has say 5 years of lots of sales at high margin ahead of it. What are going to be the profits during those 5 years? Well they are going to be a lot, quite possibly as high as $300b. The problem is NVDA's market cap is $3t. $300b is much less than you would make in a saving account. So what about after 5 years? Does it seem likely that GPU are going to stay that robust at those margins?What do the next 5 look like? Does huge AI expansion (not even simply replacement of existing systems) continue. If the profits aren't much higher NVDA is massively overpriced. At 3x the sales of the previous 5 the stock is still overpriced. NVDA isn't building new capacity to handle growth of even 200%. Which means the anticipation for the 5 after that have to be terrific Huge growth at staggering margins for 2 decades. Does that sound likely?What will happen is NVDA will see a drop off in demand, a large compression in margin and the stock will tank. NVDA will be a major chip maker for decades to come. It will have products that need to be refreshed, selling a good product at a good price on a consistent and profitable basis. And despite that rosy future existing investors will have terrible returns.https://www.reddit.com/r/IncomeInvesting/comments/vh3bz0/dividends_always_win/",0,0.544,NEGATIVE,1.0

Someone must lose in order for an economy to function.,"The company has strong financials. I am not a professional and my advice might be horrible, so make your own decisions.The company is run well, has a good product and a large customer base. I think it will continue to perform well. I do not think NVidia will go out of business.So, I think it is a good investment, but so are other tech stocks.Do not plan for it to continue to double and triple in value however. If it does well that's awesome if it doesn't but makes a more typical 10-22% annual growth that is a solid investmentDo not invest all your money in any one company.Have a diverse portfolio of market segments and types of investment that makes sense for your age.Stock and the stock market is a funny thing. If you multiply the number of shares of a stock by the price per share you will get a number that ideally reflects what the company is actually worth. So if someone had that much money they could buy all the stock and own the company.But the $/share often varies. The actual price is based on how many people are selling their stock and how many people are buying. It is an auction- one person is selling 10 shares, if 17 people want to buy it, whoever pays the most gets the stock. So ""Wall Street sentiment"" impacts the share price but you always need to double check that the total value of stock makes sense for that company.",0,0.599,NEGATIVE,1.0
