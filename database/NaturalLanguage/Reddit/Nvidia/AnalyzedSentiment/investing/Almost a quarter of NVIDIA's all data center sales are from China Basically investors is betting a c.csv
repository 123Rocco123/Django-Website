Never seen this kind of behavior outside of crypto bros.Been invested in NVDA for more than 15 years, consume everything I can about it. I see all sides and understand the strengths and weaknesses of the company. I've made a lot of money and want to help others understand this company and the opportunity.In this case, the OP's headline including ""Basically investors is betting a company's future sales growth that is heavily depending on China's economy growth"" is not accurate. It's not ""heavily,"" it's a fraction. It's also an issue that's been adjusted to by both parties:The [Nvidia] founder said in December that the company has been “ working very closely” with the US government to create compliant products. US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said last month that Nvidia “can, will and should sell AI chips to China because most AI chips will be for commercial applications”Did you have that information before you posted?As far as my participation, anyone is free to read my comments or not, they are just there for information. It's not my responsibility if that troubles you or others. Friends and acquaintances alike have made money, lots of money in some cases, because of my input on this company.I'll discuss with anyone anything about NVDA: Financial, Technology, Strategy, Mistakes, Opportunity, Competition, Market Segments, History, what ever. Anything except trading (not the way to profit from NVDA imo). In the end, discussions validate my own investment thesis on the company.

AMD is only really a competitor in consumer electronics space, but their current growth is driven by AI chips which they basically have a monopoly on.Great question, never thought of it in those terms. Nvidia will remain the incumbent until they’re not. I’ve always thought I would get out when a serious challenger showed up. Projecting from this moment, I believe that will be a new technology (serious quantum or neuromorphic computing for example, not science experiments).I don’t think AMD is that. AMD has good technology, but in GPU they’re playing nvidia’s game on nvidia’s turf. Their model is not “I’m going to invest in and lead the tech sector into a new opportunity.” It’s more like, I’m going to figure out a way to undercut and optimize and whittle away at your market share.In the CPU space, they played the long game and Intel stepped on themselves, AMD was ready to take advantage and did. In consumer GPU AMD’s share has been slipping over the years, primarily I believe because they weren’t working with Game Developers the way Nvidia did. I can’t see AMD ever in a position of dictating in the GPU space. But they will do fine on their own. They will be a generation or more behind in hardware/features and at least that in software. The only real leverage they have is price. And we shouldn't get into thinking ML hardware is interchangeable. No one has proved it is yet.What are the biggest risks to this monopoly position with respect to AI chips? (Market change, competitors?)several areasThe biggest risk atm, I believe is government intervention. China (along with Russia, N Korea, Iran and a few other) are being curtailed from buying the best GPUs. It’s not hard to imagine the US limiting export license to our allies, or later to the favored 5 or what ever they call them if the solutions get to be too good (AGI for example, which could level things up for a lot of countries). Scenarios like those would certainly inhibit growth.Supply. Obviously a single source (TSMC) is a large issue. I personally don’t think China would risk an invasion of Taiwan for the crown jewel of TSMC for two reasons, a) so much of the world economy is dependent on chips and a takeover would therefore trigger WWWIII with the Americas, Europe and much of Asia ready to say, hell no, and b) It’s super easy to screw up a batch ($75M retail) of $40,000 GPUs by skipping or modifying one of hundreds of complex steps. TSMC operators would never just say, sure, we’ll work for you guys who came in here with guns. The crown jewel is worthless at that point. Ramping other fabs in North America over the next couple of years will help a lot, but these chips are going to get progressively more complex, not simpler.Market wise, Open Source software gets a lot of lip service about damaging Nvidia’s business, and I’m still trying to make that model work in my head. The problem the open source proponents don’t see is that Nvidia is a platform, which is a combination of hardware and software. The OS community seems to think the hardware is interchangeable. It doesn’t work like that. Look at the iPhone, hugely popular, but iOS only comes on Apple phones. And it’s iOS that opens up the app store and all the productivity that brings. I think Nvidia’s ML platform is similar, it’s the combination of hardware and software that create the application environment and productivity. Jury is out, we’ll know in a year of two.Competitors - I just don’t see anyone dislodging Nvidia at this point. Big CSPs who are building chips are being marginalized by Nvidia opening up competitors like Coreweave, Lamda, Vast, Oracle etc. So internally sourced parts like Google TPU or Amazon Trainium and Inferentia basically never leave the inside of those providers -- no opportunity for external footprint. A key feature of Nvidia’s solution is portability, if you don’t like Azure’s pricing move to Lamda. Intel does have a good part with Gaudi that may get some business.Ultimately AMD and Intel are going to chip away market share from Nvidia. I always look at that like when the market is growing at ~30% CAGR, so who cares, Nvidia can’t support them all anyway. In 5 years I'd be surprised if Nvida is less than 70% share but the market will probably 2-3X CY24 in size.NVIDIA was the gaming GPU monopoly. This doesn't affect tech market as a whole, so who cares, let them grow.Now that NVIDIA is a premiere AI chip provider, their ability to deliver and their costs are going to cause industry consumers to consider the cost of finding alternatives.Yes NVIDIA has a huge head start, but we're already seeing competitors trying to jump to fill the profit margin gap that NVIDIA has.complex answer. a) cost of more advanced process nodes is increasing. b) cost of memory in the solution is considerable and growing c) packaging costs are increasing, d) the GPU is just the processor — a lot of what Nvidia has been optimizing over the last 8 years or so is moving data into and out of the GPU, the whole storage to compute data pipeline. So cost are high because what's being processed is complex. No one is going to do it better or faster imo. A whole lot of guys have tried, but there are a whole lot of corpses in NVDA's wake.As far as alternatives, great. Where are they? Ultimately ML compute buyers are looking for the lowest total cost (TCO). Nvidia DGX, or Cloud solution is plug and play, it just works. AMD MI300? well first it needs hosting then it needs bring up then it needs optimization for example. There are development costs associated with every step. The question is to what degree does that factor into a GPU purchase or commitment? Those costs need to be considered. As a result, I don't see anyone else gaining much traction.• Yes NVIDIA has a huge head start, but we're already seeing competitors trying to jump to fill the profit margin gap that NVIDIA has.   The yahoo article is pretty superficial. It’s funny. In like 2016 everyone was going to build AI chips. The perception was: super easy, it’s just some ALUs and some fat memory bandwidth. Just ask Elon Musk. The truth is he’s still trying to get his dojo chip to scale. There is a reason Elon buys a lot of GPUs (and it’s not because he can afford it). It’s because they work, and getting them to work well is hard, as Lisa Su said in a presentation a few months ago.I hear you on the fat margins look ripe for the taking message. As I've been trying to say, it's not as easy as just putting up a new chip. Software is very important. So any challenger needs a strong compliment software wise. Jensen Huang said after they aborted the mobile market that he only wants to enter markets he can dominate. It was just a few years after that he saw AI/ML and pivoted the company.Conflict of Interest DisclosureMy disclosure is Nvidia is an outsized portion of my portfolio, well over 50%. My initial stake was mid 5 digits. I’ve been selling a bit at intervals since 2016. Then I do a little more research and think I should hold and the rest blows up. repeat I do buy in my IRAs when the opportunity presents. Fidelity people think I’m an idiot, and I did too for a while until it didn’t matter any more.Mostly, I'm interested in tracking companies in monopolistic positions and seeing how they behave in the market. MSFT, NVDA are my two monopolistic choices in the tech sector.I don’t like the term monopolistic. For tech I prefer leadership. In nvidia’s case, the only reason Nvidia worked into a leadership position is because the competition wasn’t working as hard. Both AMD and Intel (and QCOM for that matter) had similar opportunities but they didn't move. When AMD bought ATI in 2006 or so these GPU businesses were about the same size.Recently have been adding to my position on MSFT, concur they’re going to do well in the near term. On a side note, I think META is looking like a nice swing trade soon.",4,0.54,1.0,NEGATIVE

I think in fact maybe too dense for an internet conversation, not in an effective way, but let me hit on a few points that stand out to me.Considering you mentioned that you have over 50% of your Portfolio in NVIDIA, are you at all worried that you may be becoming emotionally bias and specifically seeking information that is favorable to NVIDIA? I imagine it has served you well, but I know all too well what it's like to invest your time and money into something, have it rise exponentially, seemingly with no ceiling, having no real competition, only to have have it's potential halved because I did not diversify fast enough. I think your investment is technically safer than mine was, because of where NVIDIA lives in the global food-chain of current tech trends, but even still I somewhat agree with the Fidelity people. I'm assuming if NVIDIA dropped 30%+ over the next year, you would be okay with this?In consumer GPU AMD’s share has been slipping over the years, primarily I believe because they weren’t working with Game Developers the way Nvidia did. I can’t see AMD ever in a position of dictating in the GPU space. But they will do fine on their own. They will be a generation or more behind in hardware/features and at least that in software. The only real leverage they have is price. And we shouldn't get into thinking ML hardware is interchangeable. No one has proved it is yet.This is more of a moral issue for me. Yeah, it has been a shrewd business move, but NVIDIA basically went out of their way and corner developers into using proprietary technology that undermined AMD GPUs. In technology hardware standards help processes and software develop.There is no reason to think that NVIDIA is the only one capable of developing ML hardware, all they are is just massively parallel cores with specific APIs. As the tech becomes more common there will be more demand for a standard. With time I imagine we're going to see software middleware that abstracts your needs to different AI chips the same way that OPENGL, Direct 3D does between different manufacturer's graphics processes.The biggest risk atm, I believe is government intervention... Supply. Obviously a single source (TSMC) is a large issue...I do wonder if you are undervaluing this risk. World's kind of on fire right now. Risk of war is at an all time high, which increase the likely-hood of both of these things to come to pass in my opinion.Competitors - I just don’t see anyone dislodging Nvidia at this point...Maybe you're right, not in the next few years. But does that mean you are planning on timing the market with respect to your exit on NVDA?I hear you on the fat margins look ripe for the taking message. As I've been trying to say, it's not as easy as just putting up a new chip. Software is very important. So any challenger needs a strong compliment software wise.Can you elaborate on the software advantage the NVIDIA has? Do you mean, this? I'm struggling to understand how this is different from the GPU development software that they used to provide, similar to how AMD did. Honestly, when it comes to Software I wouldn't give NVIDIA a significant stronghold there.In my experience the only kind of software that holds ""leader"" positions well is creative software that is often used by non-computer-technical people. Think of Photoshop, Adobe Premiere, think AutoCAD, Maya. These are things that come with a depth of features that make challengers have to jump through hoops in order to reach feature parity. AI development is still a deeply technical task, and software devs and software-adjacent people are used to jumping to new tools and frameworks. Software devs also love having their software work on any hardware that it can abstract to.Personally, I think the only real advantage NVIDIA has right now is that they are currently the largest volume and most use provider right now at the height of this ""AI is the newest buzzword after Metaverse"" event. (AI/ML is definitely here to stay, but we're already running into a lot of plateaus about their capabilities.) Chip manufacturing is difficult to set up. A company needs to make years of mistakes before they have something functional, so I do see an advantage staying there for a bit... but I think as AI/ML work normalizes, people will start founding standards, and once standards are defined there will be more interest/capability in creating competitors. Think of what the market was like when the first GPU was created...As a closing thought. You and I have had a conversation on this topic before, under less friendly exchanges. I speculated that you had a large portion of your portfolio in NVDA, and I guess this thread has kind of confirmed it. All I know is that if I had more than 20% of my portfolio in a single company, especially one that I am not currently employed in/leading... I wouldn't trust my own opinion on the company, because at that point I am drinking the Kool-Aide, and for personal mental health reasons it would be in my interest to look for favorable news on said company.",5,0.548,0.996,NEGATIVE
