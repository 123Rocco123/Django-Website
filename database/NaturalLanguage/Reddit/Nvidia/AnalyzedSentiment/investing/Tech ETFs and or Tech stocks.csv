,"Hey folks. I hold a couple popular ETFs in the sp500, growth, tech. I also am holding stock in nvidia, apple, google, Amazon. My question is - since my individual stocks are already heavily in the ETFs I have, is it better to sell them and put the money to bolster up my ETFs? Or in your experience would one benefit from the individual stocks increasing on price and eventually stocks splits etc etc TIA","is it better to sell them and put the money to bolster up my ETFs?Define ""better"". Will it make you feel better? Will the future unknown return be better?Buy a tech ETF then add individual stocks because you want more exposure to those stocks than the ETF gives.Don't over-complicate this. ETFs get their percentages via a lot of different ways including market cap. These percentages are not written in stone by God. Adjust the weighting how you want by adding individual stocks... or if you don't want to do that, just stick with the ETF.",0,0.533,NEGATIVE,0.999

Rather than eliminating the individual stock, you could add some other index that does NOT have those holdings. Small cap comes to mind, for the ones you mention.Whether this is in a taxed or account or not makes some difference. In an IRA or 401k, trimming/eliminating profitable positions avoids the capital gains tax.",0,0.533,NEGATIVE,0.999
