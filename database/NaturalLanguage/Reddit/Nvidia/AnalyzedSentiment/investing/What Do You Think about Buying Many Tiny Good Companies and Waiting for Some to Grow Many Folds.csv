Only 2012 and 2013 came out negative, 0.6x and 0.4x respectively.The best dates to have held Nvidia stock for 5 years in descending order:Jan 01, 2021 16.2Jan 01, 2018 15.6Jan 01, 2024 15.1Jan 01, 2020 11.9Jan 01, 2022 11.4Jan 01, 2008 8.5Jan 01, 2019 8.2Jan 01, 2017 7.3Jan 01, 2023 3.0Jan 01, 2010 2.3As long as you didn't sell early 2023, this decade is a clear winner.Thanks for making me a bit happier with myself.Perhaps what's really needed is a list of Nvidia performance compared to the market.",1,0.538,0.514,NEGATIVE
