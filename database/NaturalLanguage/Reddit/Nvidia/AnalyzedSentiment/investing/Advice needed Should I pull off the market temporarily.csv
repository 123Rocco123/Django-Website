,"I’m 38, living in the U.S., and looking for some guidance on my Roth IRA investments. This account is primarily for my daughter’s future education and my retirement (I also have a pension to fall back on). I’m still working and ham 22 years from retirement. Currently, I have about $13k invested in this account. Most of it is in FGBRX (a blue-chip fund), with smaller positions in NVidia and AMD. The market has been performing well, but I’m nervous about a potential downturn, especially if Trump re-enters office. Tariffs seem to be back on the table, and from everything I’ve read and watched, they seem like a bad idea economically. I’m worried a market crash could be looming. I know the conventional wisdom says to stick it out and let the market ebb and flow over the long term. But I’m considering pulling out of the market temporarily—just for a few months—to see how things play out. I’d really appreciate some advice. Am I overthinking this? Should I just stay the course, or does it make sense to go to cash for a bit given the uncertainty?",So you know timing the market is a bad idea but you want to do it anyways? Good luck,0,0.545,0.82,NEGATIVE

That's why over 90% of them fail at it.Long term investing means buying and holding, consistently for years, with the understanding that the intermediate ups and downs don't matter when your target goal is decades away.As you get closer to the day you want to start pulling from the investment, you slowly shift to less volatile (and less profitable) investments in case one of those downturns happens shortly before you're ready.

No one knows whether the market will crash next week, in a few months, or in a few years. I’m no expert, but I would suggest pulling out a portion of your investments—maybe half—and putting it in a High-Interest Savings Account (HISA), while keeping the other half invested.
