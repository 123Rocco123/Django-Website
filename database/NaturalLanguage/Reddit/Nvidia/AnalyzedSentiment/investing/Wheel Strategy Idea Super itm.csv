,"So, I've been doing some thinking/analysis about the wheel strategy. Some appeals to it are the guaranteed premiums it brings in, the relatively small risk it has, and the ability to be flexible in most markets (assuming you're wheeling a good stock). Usually, you try to sell your initial put otm for a chance at more later and to not get assigned at an ""upcharge."" Some people are able to make this their full time job. Here's what I've been thinking: What if you were to sell the put way itm? With enough collateral (I played around with the numbers) you could take a year's salary in the form of one premium on a single, week-long put. You would obviously be assigned, but you'd have an entire year to make up the difference by selling cc's, the stock going up, and dividends. Selling super safe calls (staying way itm) every week should in theory be enough to cover the ""salary"" as well as churn a profit for most of the stocks I analyzed (Nvidia, Apple, even VOO). And to me, it seems even safer than buying and holding, due to the ""salary"" being instant. Is this the GOAT of trading? Or does this belong in r/wallstreetbets?","This is down below WSB and in meme stock territory for levels of not understanding how finical instruments work.You need to discriminate between intrinsic and extrinsic value.Currently SPY is at 443, and the top contract for next week is 540. Selling that contract will net you roughly 97 dollars per share, so 9,700 in premium and 54,000 in collateral bringing your account to 63,700. You will then get immediately get exercised giving you 100 shares of SPY worth 44,300 and 9,700 in cash, leaving you at a grand total of 54,000 dollars. So congrats, you managed to buy 100 shares, pay extra fees, and give Uncle Sam a nice 9700 dollar taxable event.That's the long way of saying that there is only intrinsic value on the contract, your exposure at that point is equal to just being long shares, and the only profit you can make would be positive price movement between selling the contract and assignment. You need to sell contracts with extrinsic value to make any money as intrinsic value is effectively 0 due to cancellation once assignment happens. Willfully selling ITM is almost always an edge case.",0,0.542,0.999,NEGATIVE

And the holding period for the shares begins on the settlement date of the assignment, not on the date that the put is written. It is not a taxable event until the assigned shares are sold.https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550#en_US_2022_publink100010627",1,0.513,1.0,NEGATIVE

Obviously with a delta that's almost 1 - there will be no extrinsic value. But that's also going to be true for itm puts with delta near 0. And OP didn't mention the delta being selected.OP mentioned using 5-7dte short puts. So if you look at the 9/22 weeklies on SPY - you will notice that there is extrinsic value on deep itm and otm puts - the 10 delta otm and 90 delta itm puts have similar extrinsic value at around 0.20 - 0.30 with some variance.The problem with these types of strategies is that it may or may not be appropriate based on an investor or trader's financial situation and goal. And there are also factors like margin efficiency and things like interest rate. Writing puts in general may be less efficient in a high interest rate environment since rho has an impact on short put premiums. And margin utilization on itm puts may be higher.That's kinda why I mentioned why risk management and sizing is important in my initial comment to OP. And why I wouldn't consider a strategy like this using individual stocks or ETFs as an underlying.The thing about options trading is that it can be made as conservative or risky even on similar strategies.",1,0.521,0.999,NEGATIVE

Or does this belong in r/wallstreetbets?","I would say it's more akin to treating change as a payout, you buy 15 dollars worth of goods and pay with a 20 and get 5 back. You didn't come out ahead or generate an extra 5 dollars. With this strategy you just get your change before you pay. The cashier hands you 5 dollars, you hand them a 20, and get 15 dollars worth of goods.If you have 54K and just buy the shares now you'll have 9700 left over, if you sell the put you'll have 9700 and be out 54K and be in the exact same position. Options don't have many arbitrage opportunities and are zero sum, Rho will ensure the the price of the put is depressed by the interest you make on the cash collateral for example.",2,0.521,1.0,NEGATIVE

Or does this belong in r/wallstreetbets?",Sure - it's a wheel variation that could work. It depends on the underlying and how far itm you are talking about.Try back-testing the concept against SPY or SPX an /ES. I'm not sure that I would pick individual stocks or ETFs for such a strategy.There are some similar variations using atm puts and when assigned writing a straddle or high delta strangle as well if you want to explore these types of strategies. You can also play around with different DTEs.These can be leveraged strategies though so risk management and sizing management can become pretty important.[edit] - btw - I suggested SPX and /ES instead because these are european-style options and you can leverage better. The problem with using equities with american-style options is early exercise risk.Coincidentally - someone mentioned a new put-write fund from Defiance in the discord - QQQY - that that does something similar with QQQ by writing itm and atm 0dte puts. https://www.defianceetfs.com/qqqy/ Prospectus here - https://www.defianceetfs.com/wp-content/uploads/funddocs/qqqy/QQQY-Prospectus.pdf,0,0.52,1.0,NEGATIVE
