,"I don't understand why people are depending on NVIDIA's earnings for the general macroeconomic feel. Although they are an important piece of information, they have 0 gauge as to how well our entire economy is doing, minimally in the semiconductor industry.",As it's market cap grew it takes up larger part of etfs.  It also is basically a benchmark for AI future growth in tech.  Stock market is forward looking so they want that future to be secure.,0,0.601,0.581,POSITIVE

NVDA is the oil and gas of AI so it‚Äôs a harbinger of success or disaster. And AI is driving the bull run we‚Äôre seeing. So yeah it‚Äôs important.,1,0.536,1.0,POSITIVE

The run is purely based on AI.It will determine if we continue pumping or have some sort of short term correctionEDIT: There ya go, NVDA earnings beat caused everything to rip (yes even non tech stocks), ES is up 0.9% during AH.",0,0.533,0.997,NEGATIVE
,"I don't understand why people are depending on NVIDIA's earnings for the general macroeconomic feel. Although they are an important piece of information, they have 0 gauge as to how well our entire economy is doing, minimally in the semiconductor industry.","Indeed. So NVDA is more of an indicator of what the [cap weighted] stock market will do next, NOT the economy. That is totally different. However, I would add that if NVDA crashes there could be plenty of ""normal"" stocks (e.g. defensive sectors) that do just fine; in fact they might even go up, as the sellers will have to do something with their cash.",1,0.536,0.732,NEGATIVE

Although they are an important piece of information, they have 0 gauge as to how well our entire economy is doing, minimally in the semiconductor industry.","Hmm it appears you are confusing the terms recession, bear market and ‚Äúlost decade‚Äù.Based on where current valuations sit for the U.S. equity market, there is a very real possibility the annual return over the next decade will be 0 or negative. This is based on historical data of other 10 years periods with starting valuations at our current level.The most recent example of a lost decade was 2000-2010. Lots of volatility and 2 major recessions resulting in a long interesting trip nowhere for the equity market. Current valuations are higher now than they were then on a market cap/gva basis.Forward returns look dismal to say the least and I think a lot of the ‚Äúalways buy the dip regardless of price‚Äù crowd will be surprised that the price you pay for an investment does indeed matter.",3,0.535,1.0,NEGATIVE
