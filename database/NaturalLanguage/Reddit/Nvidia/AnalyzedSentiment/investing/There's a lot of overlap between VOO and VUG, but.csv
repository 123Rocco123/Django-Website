,"Would it still make sense to invest in both of them, assuming that down the road, today's famous tech stocks will no longer be the top OVERALL stocks? I don't think that Apple, Alphabet, Meta, and NVIDIA will claim the throne forever, and so having both VOO and VUG under your belt might be a way to hedge yourself against their eventual decline. Or should I just stick to VOO?","VOO tracks the S&P 500 - which is large cap blend of both value and growth.VUG is less diversified, purely a large cap growth ETF.You are missing out on domestic small and mid caps.You are also missing out on international small, mid and large caps.In terms of keeping it simple ( I am a big proponent of keeping things simple, 1-2 funds)You can cover all your bases with VTI (US Total Market) + VXUS (International Total Market)60/40 Weighting Respectively.However if you have the conviction for more large cap growth, VUG is fine.Making bets on sectors is purely speculative.All the best on your investment journey!!",0,0.536,0.939,POSITIVE

Or should I just stick to VOO?",Why don’t you simplify it even more and go 100% VT instead of 60% VTI and 40% VXUS? Serious question trying to follow your thought process. Thx,1,0.506,1.0,NEGATIVE

Or should I just stick to VOO?","VOO is a blend of large cap growth and value, VUG is just LC growth. So you’d simply be weighted towards LC growth is all. If that’s your intention, sure go for it, but obviously there’s no way of knowing whether growth or value will outperform.Don’t neglect mid cap, small cap, or international either, for the same reason that we just don’t know which will outperform.",0,0.531,1.0,NEGATIVE

Or should I just stick to VOO?",Those worry about volatility should consider an equally weighted S&P 500. Let other stocks truly hold up the decline value from 6 tech companies which drove up 85% of momentum in SPY. Take a look at DJIA like DIA which has just ~10% weight in 2 techs that gives similar returns.Contrarians who do opposite of others often has an edge.,0,0.517,1.0,NEGATIVE

If you want to reduce your exposure to those particular companies, VTV (a value fund) would make more sense. Or VFMO (a momentum fund) could sell them before they fall too far.",0,0.522,0.6,POSITIVE
