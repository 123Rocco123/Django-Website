,"Ever since growing up I can’t help but create tier lists of everything imaging the most extreme levels to things, so I am gonna create a trading level system and am curious what you guys would add or subtract? So let’s assume it’s 1 year ago and you had a hunch Nvidia was gonna blow up The higher the level the more money you can make/ or lose over that 1 year period Level 1: Buy and Hold Simple as that buy the stock once or a couple times as it rises and hold it long term with plans to take profits in the future Level 2: Dollar cost average Buy the stock, but every time you see a decent sized correction down you “buy the dip”, so you can keep accumulating, but at a lower average price than someone buying randomly Level 3: Option trade (med to long) Buy 6 months - 1 year+ option calls because you have a sense it’s going up, but don’t want to guess based on swings of the week Level 4: Option trade (shortish to medium) Buy 3 weeks to 3 months options - you know a big earnings or announcement is coming up, so you place a “safe bet” (relative to a gambling addict) and you don’t have to stare at the price every day Level 5: Day trade You use a decent amount of money ($1k min) to buy a stock and then trade volatility up and down Level 6: Option trade (short term) You place options few days - 1 week out and trade volatility up and down Level 7: Option day trader This is reserved for insane people, but you buy an option expiring in 1 day so you have to buy it and sell it in the same day hoping for huge volatility up or down Level 8: Algo day trade This is reserved for math model wizards or those in companies with powerful systems to trade stocks, options, etc in milliseconds back and forth during the day executing tons of trades to accumulate profit Level 9: Whale trade The rare mega whales with billions in resources can deploy so much capital into a stock that it can trigger a spike in price, they also access to world class high frequency trading systems running at a microsecond (1/1,000,000 second) allowing trade deficiencies in a market and rapidly trade up and down making quick profit What would you add/ subtract/ change to this tier list?","By level two you've already revealed you don't know much about investing. ""Buying the dip"" implies you had cash on the sidelines, which is sub-optimal. You'd have missed out on the runup in the first place.",0,0.521,NEGATIVE,0.986
