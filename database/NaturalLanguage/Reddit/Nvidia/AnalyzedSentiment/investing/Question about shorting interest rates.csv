You can be absolutely right regarding the valuation but wrong on timing and lose your investment.Generally speaking, if someone doesn’t do enough research on their own to understand how shorting a stock would work, that’s indicative that they’re not aware of the risks involved and shouldn’t be opening that type of position.",4,0.519,NEGATIVE,1.0

It can vary depending on supply/demand. A stock like NVDA probably has very low borrow fees since it is not shorted very much.How often would I have to pay my broker interest?Borrow fees accrue daily from settlement date to settlement date. Most brokers like TDA will charge monthly.If you have a bearish outlook on NVDA - you can also explore other methods of taking a bearish position.Other ways of fixed max loss positions include call credit spreads, long puts, and long put spreads.If you have high conviction in your trade - you can also use synthetic short futures and variations.There are other techniques but if you are unfamiliar with shorting and taking a bearish position - an inverse fund like others suggested is a fixed max loss option to start with.",0,0.527,NEGATIVE,0.984

My two questions are: How much interest would I have to pay if I short them at their current market price? How often would I have to pay my broker interest?",I don't know how shorts work at Schwab. But the current rate to borrow NVDA shares is .25%. You wouldn't be paying interest on the cash you would be collecting it. Most brokers for small accounts take the interest on the cash and pay the interest on the borrowing fees. You could look into single stock futures since the spread between borrowing fees and cash means it is definitely worth it for you to short at the commercial rate rather than retail rate.,0,0.522,NEGATIVE,0.926
