,"Note: This post is descriptive of my personal observations and is for discussion purposes only. It is neither predictive in what will happen next nor is it prescriptive in suggesting any course of investment actions. I've only done 3 predictive posts on this sub and this won't be one of them. For those who are too young to remember that time: There was this new thing called ""the Internet"", and it was going to forever change the world (it eventually did), and every company that hypes up some sort of ""internet tech"" (could be simple landing page that sells stuff, i.e Pets.com) received sky high valuation. And there was one company behind it that made it all possible: Cisco, the company that sells industrial routers and switches to telecom providers that power the backbone of the entire internet infrastructure, was obviously a company that was ""selling shovels during a gold rush"" and would take over the whole world. Its share price went up 236% from Jan.1999 to March 2000, reached a valuation of $500B+ (record high for a company back then), P/E went through the roof but it didn't matter because the Internet Revolution^TM was just beginning (and it was), so naturally Cisco's share price could only go higher. The cherry on the top was that back then the top two companies were Microsoft and Cisco, one would provide the software (Internet Explorer baby!) and the other would sell the hardware. Together they would rule the world! Now if you replace ""Internet"" with ""AI"", and ""Cisco"" with ""Nvidia"", keep Microsoft as it is (but replace ""IE"" with ChatGPT""), and we have quite a mirror version of what's happening today. Then we all know what happened. Cisco obviously survived the bubble burst and remains profitable and is still doing fine today, but $CSCO never recovered back to its dotcom bubble peak after crashing 80% during the dotcom bust, 23 years later. Now will the same thing happen with $NVDA? Like I said I don't know and I'm not making any predictions. All I can say is that I see a lot of parallels so far. Edit: For people replying to me arguing how you can't mine Bitcoins using network switches or how Cisco didn't do AI, no kidding, at no point did I claim the two companies are identical and sell the same things, that would be idiotic. All I am saying is the hype, expectation, and position of these two companies in their respective backdrop, are similar to each other.",You are missing the part where Cisco doubled and split 9 times in the 9 years prior to 1999.The Internet wasn't built in 1999. It was built from about 1992 to 2000 and built rapidly. (of course continued to grow even through bubble burst just slower)(Ex Cisco guy here. Best years of my career),0,0.519,POSITIVE,0.911

,"Note: This post is descriptive of my personal observations and is for discussion purposes only. It is neither predictive in what will happen next nor is it prescriptive in suggesting any course of investment actions. I've only done 3 predictive posts on this sub and this won't be one of them. For those who are too young to remember that time: There was this new thing called ""the Internet"", and it was going to forever change the world (it eventually did), and every company that hypes up some sort of ""internet tech"" (could be simple landing page that sells stuff, i.e Pets.com) received sky high valuation. And there was one company behind it that made it all possible: Cisco, the company that sells industrial routers and switches to telecom providers that power the backbone of the entire internet infrastructure, was obviously a company that was ""selling shovels during a gold rush"" and would take over the whole world. Its share price went up 236% from Jan.1999 to March 2000, reached a valuation of $500B+ (record high for a company back then), P/E went through the roof but it didn't matter because the Internet Revolution^TM was just beginning (and it was), so naturally Cisco's share price could only go higher. The cherry on the top was that back then the top two companies were Microsoft and Cisco, one would provide the software (Internet Explorer baby!) and the other would sell the hardware. Together they would rule the world! Now if you replace ""Internet"" with ""AI"", and ""Cisco"" with ""Nvidia"", keep Microsoft as it is (but replace ""IE"" with ChatGPT""), and we have quite a mirror version of what's happening today. Then we all know what happened. Cisco obviously survived the bubble burst and remains profitable and is still doing fine today, but $CSCO never recovered back to its dotcom bubble peak after crashing 80% during the dotcom bust, 23 years later. Now will the same thing happen with $NVDA? Like I said I don't know and I'm not making any predictions. All I can say is that I see a lot of parallels so far. Edit: For people replying to me arguing how you can't mine Bitcoins using network switches or how Cisco didn't do AI, no kidding, at no point did I claim the two companies are identical and sell the same things, that would be idiotic.

NVDA’s chart will very likely end up looking like a sharp mountain peak within a few years. Imagine extrapolating a recent surge in profitability and saying “Well, it doesn’t look expensive on a forward P/E basis”, completely ignoring that forward earning estimates may be too high and even if they achieve them, thinking they’re sustainable in any way. Recent developments in AI have led to far more hype than substance. After serious share price declines in in 2022, tech companies latched onto AI in 2023 as a convenient way of reflating the bubble.Folks will convince themselves that buying NVDA is reasonable because, well, it’s gone up so much and could go up so much more.
