,"Looking for the appropriate ticker for the companies associated with the Stark Varg, mainly the parent company that is responsible for production. I see EML just made a major investment in the company, and it is a product I have interest in. I enjoy watching and racing motorcross(although I'm terrible). This year XGames best whip gold medal went to a rider on a... Stark. While they won't be the next NVidia, electric dirt bikes are seeing, and will continue to see a rise for a while. Although they sound incredibly annoying, there's no doubt they are very fast, and as technology improves, so will the battery life, and that is the only thing really holding them back from competing in larger events.",Interested in this as well,0,0.568,POSITIVE,0.994
