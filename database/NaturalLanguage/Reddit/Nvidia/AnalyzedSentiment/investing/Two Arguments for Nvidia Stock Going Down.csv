,"I found this video, which essentially makes two points why Nvidia Stock is going to face challenges soon. Concern: Nvidia is building data centers for AI, but these data centers can not yet be used by companies to meet actual end-consumer demands which would be necessary in order to create actual revenue. The idea is that the ""customer (of those data centers) has no customer"". Thus, it has created a bubble, similar to a real estate bubble where many houses are being built without having people who are actually going to live in it. Concern: the author of the video creates some criteria for companies or stocks that are in the danger of a downturn, such as decelerating revenue growth, decelerating earnings growth, margins going down and a high starting valuation, leading to multiple compression. (Actual Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tRZmfmc8uc) What do you think about these two arguments/concerns. Are they valid? Cheers!",So why is Tesla going up in that case?,0,0.51,NEGATIVE,0.997

Cheers!","It's absolutely true that the AI hardware build out that's been happening has not yet produced revenue streams to cover the cost of the build out or support continuously building more indefinitely.The housing bubble analogy doesn't really work because it's not that the new capacity isn't being used at this point, it is utilized and there's still demand for more capacity. The question is are the projects using it actually going to result in significant revenue streams that justify the expense and the need for future hardware refreshes and expansions.So many companies are frothing at the mouth to use AI to solve all their problems with little understanding of what its limitations are. The less is understood, the more excitement there is.",0,0.533,NEGATIVE,1.0

But the capex cycle itself is not going to suddenly end tomorrow; estimate is ~mid 2025 it will go down and nvidia will suffer from that,0,0.539,NEGATIVE,1.0

As long as the money keeps flowing into the market the price goes up. When it stops flowing it goes down. That's it.,0,0.541,NEGATIVE,1.0
