,"NVDA will pullback in the near term, even though it's a great company that has consistently delivered for its shareholders. Why must it come down? Well, I'm a firm believer that narratives drive market sentiment, way more than fundamentals or valuations. Narratives, especially when repeated, permeate. And for the past 5 days, the narrative builders have been relentless in giving a negative short term assessment of NVDA stock. By narrative builders, I mean the financial industry people on TV asked to comment. I will give you an example. On Friday, Jim Cramer alluded to NVDA being overbought and how Larry Williams' model was predicting a pull back of the stock until end of July. This morning, Fairlead's Katie Stockton was also on Squawk Box, saying that even though she firmly believes in the bull market, NASDAQ 100 will see some pain as soon as people see that NVDA is a bit overstretched. Just 30 minutes ago, Jeff Kilburg of KKM Financial called that it's time to trim, take profits given that the stock added 1 trillion dollars in valuation. There are countless others from different sources. I really believe that once you start to hear so many ""experts"" and street people talk like this, it is reasonable to expect that a stock will come down. Not because they are right in their assessment but because others listen to it and start to wonder about trimming their positions in a self-fulfilling prophecy. This happens even if only in the very short term, before correcting to the upside and pushing higher to new highs. I actually think we are seeing the very pullback already: today, on a day when the Nasdaq is rising by 1.2%, Nvidia has found resistance around 0.3% increase and seems to be headed lower. Recently, NVDA has been the one pushing Nasdaq to new highs, so just this inversion is noteworthy. I am not a bear. At least not in that sense. And I do hope NVDA pulls back 10-20% because I intend to buy more. Cheers.","People who read the news don't survive the market. News are to be written, not read.",0,0.549,NEGATIVE,0.999
