,"Does anyone have a theory/understanding as to why electric utilities (or a basket of them like $VPU) have been a lousy investment historically? VPU in Last 5 years has returned 4.85%. Yes, electricity demand has been mostly stagnant in the past couple of decades (1-2% increase annually). However, considering that it is so timely and costly to construct power plants (for example, 5-8 years long from permitting to construction in CA), labor intensive, running power plants and distributing & transmitting electricity and guaranteed profit margins through rate increases - one would have thought it would have some premium. Secondly, what about from now into the future? AI is going to introduce a step-change function in electricity demand, raising multiple challenges around maintaining the electric grid while at the same time transitioning to cleaner energy. For example, compared to residential power consumption by city, Nvidia's H100 chips would rank as the 5th largest just behind Houston, Texas.
