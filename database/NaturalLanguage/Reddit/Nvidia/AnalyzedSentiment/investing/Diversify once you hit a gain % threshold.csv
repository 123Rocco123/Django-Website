,"Hey everyone, I’m 25M and have been putting all my spare money after expenses into the stock market. I only had to pay half of my college so that was really helpful but I’ve been working a lot of jobs and internships since 16 which helped too. So I started investing 7 years ago and have seen an annualized return of 16.1%. I bought Nvidia, Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, and others in the first couple years and have seen incredible returns from them. My question is if you would recommend I diversify any of my gains. For example I put 1k into Nvidia and now it’s around 10k. But now my stock portfolio is not that diversified because of some large gains between a few stocks I have are holding all the weight. Is there a threshold in the gain % where you start taking out and diversifying? For example, if I make 500% return on a given stock, anything over I would invest in something else. Just want to hear your thoughts because I’m still young and haven’t been around too long in the market. I want to use this money for retirement and I’m a pretty stable investor (I invest for the long run, no day trading). Thank you",I would start putting a significant % of my investable income into broad index funds if I were you,0,0.521,NEGATIVE,1.0

OP had a 16.1% annualized gain over 7 years while the S&P500 had approx a 14.5% annualized gain in that time. Now dont get me wrong the difference between 16.1 and 14.5 is going to be very significant over a lifetime, but does OP expect to keep that streak going? Going to be the one-in-a-million investor who consistently beats the market every year? When you factor in the added risk, it just isnt worth it for me.",1,0.551,NEGATIVE,1.0

You lose money to the tax man. Since you are long. Play these assets long term. Don’t just sell to diversify. It’s not bad advice but it’s advice that costs you 20%+. Instead diversify over time. Buy different stocks or funds. Should any of those not pan out. Take the loss and harvest it. At that time sell some portion of your high gain winners as an offset and use those to fund elsewhere. Paying taxes is a necessary evil. However, you don’t have to rush into it and may find balance over time without having to take a capital gains hit. I’m not a financial advisor but would suggest you have other less taxable options.",0,0.526,NEGATIVE,0.998

It’s a heuristic, but it’s reasonably backed up with backtesting. By not selling your winners immediately, you get to ride big run ups (i.e., your 10x Nvidia), but rebalancing is more or less imperative to get the full benefit of diversification.Essentially, yeah, sell some off of your big gainers to diversify.",0,0.515,NEGATIVE,0.938

Thank you","Update: Months ago I trimmed Tesla from 9k to 5k and reinvested in Broadcom, Google, Visa, and JPM. Today, I decided not to trim Apple, Microsoft, or Tesla any more. I trimmed Nvidia by 1k leaving just under 9k still invested. I also sold Roku which I had $815 in losses to offset the gains (bought during the pandemic). Lastly I bought some Micron.Thank you so much for your help and advice. Most people said to rebalance and some said to keep what I have and just diversify moving forward. I kinda took both advice. My thought process is, I took out my initial investment for Nvidia so I would not net negative. Now I made a decision that I’d be fine with losing 9k with the chance that this goes up to multiple tens of thousands of dollars in the future.Called my dad last night and he said he invested in oracle when it was less than a dollar, trimmed his initial investment and never pulled out. Because of that he hit the jackpot. I understand it’s a risk but I am willing to lose the 9k for a chance at a big long term gain like my dad had. Moving forward all the new money will be used to diversify because I agree that’s super important. I didn’t mention that I have a Roth 401k in which I invest all my money in blended large cap funds too to diversify. We will see what happens!",0,0.543,NEGATIVE,1.0
