,"So I've had a financial advisor for a while now, and I completely forgot about the account because since acquiring this advisor however many years ago, I've started doing my own investing now. I have a Roth IRA with fidelity that is managed by fidelity (under 25k has no fees, and above 25k is .35%.) Most of my money is in my brokerage account in things like Nvidia, AMD, and VOO. I also have growth stocks like RIVN that make up a much smaller percentage of my portfolio. My point is now that I've seen my own gains, and the Fidelity roth IRA is so cheap comparatively, is there even a reason to stick with a financial advisor? I have $2,500 with this guy (for comparison, I have 15k between my Roth / Brokerage / HYSA in fidelity) and frankly is there any reason I shouldn't just take that money and put it in my Roth? or brokerage account in VOO? I'm realizing that a financial advisor might be for the people that know literally nothing about investing and panic sell and buy / don't invest at all because they don't understand how investing works at all. I know the raw cost basis of having the advisor is more expensive, I'm not asking about the fees, but more so the gains that are possible personally, vs with an advisor.",It’s been years and you’ve forgotten about the account.

That sounds like a bad advisor just phoning it in. A good advisor is the motivation to get you to do more/optimize towards a specific goal. If you’re not getting that, then not worth it. But you say Fidelity has “free” lol, no such thing. I like Fidelity, but there is no free in finance… sounds like you doing great!!

And yeah I feel like I don’t need the motivation because I have my own source of that. I love investing and any money that I have lying around is automatically thrown into some sort of investment from a HYSA, to my Roth, to my brokerage, to my dividend portfolio. That’s another reason I want to drop, because I’m paying a 1.5% fee on my principal every year for no advice, no contact, and frankly, worse gains than the average 3-year return on VOO/VTI/SPY. I’ve asked him to walk me through the stratagey and he seems to just be giving me basic run of the mill answeres probably thinking I have not one idea of what I’m talking about. All he does is put all of my money in a fidelity blue chip growth fund, which is great! But I can buy that myself in the fidelity app, without paying that 1.5% fee. Frankly, I find that investing with an advisor is more annoying that doing it myself anyway… I have the power of the internet and research at my fingertips if I ever need to learn lol.",1,0.525,NEGATIVE,1.0

You don't even have to inform your advisor (the losing account). Advisors can be good, but not from what you describe. I partly blame an advisor for not knowing your total investment experience and the fact that you like doing it yourself. But you also have to take responsibility to some extent; you should have asked: hey this is what i do on my own, why should i pay you?? if the advisor is good, they would tell you just move to self directed if you like it. Or provide a compelling reason that might be of value or not.",2,0.517,NEGATIVE,1.0
