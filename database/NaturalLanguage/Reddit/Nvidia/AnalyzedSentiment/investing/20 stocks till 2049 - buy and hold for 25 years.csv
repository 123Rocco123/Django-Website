,"Hello. Apologies if this has already been posted in this community. I came across this article by Jason Zweig in WSJ. https://archive.is/20231009181337/https://www.wsj.com/articles/picking-a-stock-for-the-year-2048-66d90e The idea is to buy 20 stocks and never trade them for 25 years. This is an extremely long-term experiment created by Thomas Gayner, chief executive of Markel Group. So, I have created an account with $5000 and I am going to do this. The idea is to get my kids on this when they grow older and teach them the power of long term buy and hold. So my question is this. What 20 stocks would you pick if you cannot trade them till Feb 1, 2049. Here is my list so far. Amazon/Google/Microsoft/Apple (combined them here.. can get all 4 or pick 1-2 ) Costco Johnson and Johnson Waste Management CVS Home Depot Boeing Caterpillar GE Aerospace Intel / Micron / Nvidia Walmart/Target Starbucks / McDonalds UPS JP Morgan / Bank of America Berkshire / Markel Disney Tesla / GM Hershey Dollar General Lockheed Martin Note that the goal of this exercise is not to beat the market. But instead to show the magic of long term compounding. After 25 years, from this list, the will be some losers and some winners. But hopefully, after 25 years, the winners will dominate. Feel free to post your 20 or make changes to my list. Edit: Some really good points in the comments. Most of my regular investing goes to VOO. Think of this as a fun little experiment Since all of these are mature large companies, maybe it makes more sense to go with mid cap stocks. In that case, what would you pick?","After 25 years, from this list, the will be some losers and some winners. But hopefully, after 25 years, the winners will dominate.This is the list of top corporations in the 1998 Fortune 500. There are a lot of losers in this list, and only two of these top 25 corporations also exist in the list you named in your original post:GMFordExxonWalMartGEIBMChryslerMobilAltriaAT&TBoeingTexacoState FarmHPDuPontSearsCitigroupPrudentialChevronP&GCiticorpAmocoKMartMerrill LynchJC PenneyBy only picking mature companies, you are going to end up with more big losers than big winners.

The results will teach your kids the opposite because it is highly likely many (maybe most) of your picks will turn out to be losers. This is why for the long term, the average person should buy index funds rather than individual stocks.Your VOO fund on the other hand will teach them buy and hold. The real lesson is the power of indexes. The index auto-magically will cycle stocks so you get the best outcome with no effort.
