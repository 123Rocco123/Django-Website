The longer the dip from the ATH continues, the higher the likelihood that NVDA will lose its darling status as a stock and become just another tech company. Slow and steady growth from here is more likely than rocketing upward performance. I think it will outperform and will pull other things up with it, but only by a slim margin.

Share your insights and tips on effective stock analysis!","Nvidia the company most likely will continue to perform well: Jensen is a capable CEO, the company has technical leadership, brand leadership, and a strong IP arsenal.All of these things, of course, are already priced into the stock: NVDA the stock is trading at a P/E of 72 whereas the greater S&P 500 is roughly 25. Investors and analysts continue to place a high premium on NVDA because of the aforementioned factors, among others. One of the following three things will occur:NVDA continues to see P/E expansion to previously unheard of levels for an established S&P 500 company.NVDA sees P/E compression as it and the rest of the Tech sector regress to the mean.NVDA sees P/E remain relatively constant.At the same time, one of the following three things will occur each quarter:NVDA will continue to exceed earnings expectations.NVDA will meet but not exceed earnings expectations.NVDA will fall short of earnings expectations.You could construct a 3x3 matrix comprising the nine possible scenarios (edit: reddit tables made a mess of this, but I'll leave it in):|| || |P/E Exp - Earn Exceed|P/E Exp - Earn Meet|P/E Exp - Earn Fail| |P/E Const - Earn Exceed|P/E Const - Earn Meet|P/E/ Exp - Earn Fail| |P/E Compress - Earn Exceed|P/E Compress - Earn Meet|P/E Compress - Earn Fail|In four of the scenarios we can expect a rising share price. In five of the scenarios we can expect a falling share price. This is a very rough approximation because it depends on (a) the degree to which earnings exceed or fall short of expectations, (b) the degree of P/E expansion or compression, and (c) the efficiency/rationality of the market in the short term, which is the largest unknown.There is no technical analysis that will help you. Staring at historical charts and trying to read the future is nonsense. Bob Prechter made more money peddling his newsletters than he ever did as a technical trader at Merrill. The same goes for all the market technicians you see on CNBC: They're on television instead of on a beach in Tahiti for a reason.If you want to buy NVDA, buy it with the understanding that it might go down a lot in the short term. You might be down 60% at times. But its fundamentals are strong and, so long as they remain strong, the earnings will grow and the price will recover and grow over the long term. The higher the P/E multiple, the longer your time horizon needs to be. I would not buy NVDA unless I was prepared to hold those shares for at least the next 15 years. Twenty is better. Short-term speculation on high flyers is a great way to lose your shirt.",0,0.54,NEGATIVE,0.999

Check out Chuck's YouTube channel.Basically his mantra is: price follows earnings.The tool plots price and earnings on the same chart and instantly lets you see if a stock is over or under valued.Of course the problem is there could be earnings surprises. The tool incorporates analysts estimates. In some industries these are almost 100% reliable. Aflac has a near perfect score.Currently FastGraphs suggests Nvidia is wildly overvalued. If there is any disappointment in their earnings, they could crash hard. Hardware can absolutely crash and burn if the world becomes saturated with inventory and/or somebody invents a different way of generating AI stuff.FastGraphs suggests Meta and Alphabet are fair value right now. Microsoft is wildly overvalued. Amazon is more difficult to analyse but anecdotally I am seeing far fewer delivery vans in my road.Personally I combine FastGraphs with gap trading (gaps are generally always filled if you stick to large caps with steady earnings).",0,0.529,POSITIVE,0.707

Also talking about Nvidia tell me what company has made a x11 in two years and do not tell me because everything has a chip or boom of AI, there is not a reason to make x11 exept fill with public money companies like EEUU and EU are doing. Only one company is moving the entire stock market, only one !! and is because they have to create a fake feeling to gain your vote, only cause that, x11 is natural growth ??If somebody believe that this is not going to crash and the growth is gonna continue is ok for me, not my money, but many are saying this with data, not going to say anything about EU in recesion and USA very close to it because nobody believe it and bla bla.They what to bring the CBDC and is the perfect moment but before is going to crash i do not believe that is going to be a soft landing.",2,0.561,NEGATIVE,0.994
