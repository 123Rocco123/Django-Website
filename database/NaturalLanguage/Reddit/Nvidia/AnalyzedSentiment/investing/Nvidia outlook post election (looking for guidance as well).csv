,"What are people’s thoughts on Nvidia post election? I am in a predicament because almost half of my portfolio is Nvidia stock (due to the stock ballooning over the past year or so). The other half is pretty much all s&p index funds. I am worried Trump’s tariffs would cause Nvidia to crater, so I’m not sure what to do with it being such a huge part of my portfolio. I have contemplated setting a stop loss order which would guarantee my gain (I’m at +800% gain on my Nvidia position) and then I would probably just reinvest the proceeds into my index funds. Is this smart? I am not a day trader so I don’t want to get caught off guard if Nvidia falls super fast.","Likely nvidia will push the cost to consumers, in this case big tech. As the demand is high it will likely remain bullish and sold out.",0,0.543,NEGATIVE,0.999

Not that I see them collapsing in value either but it's not particularly clear that can just push the cost to their data center customers.,1,0.538,NEGATIVE,0.999

I have some Nvidia and at least for the time being, I am holding. Still, I am a firm believer in not having all your eggs in one basket.
