Very sophisticated.My point is that your valuation of NVDA is just as speculative as the oposite side, your making up projections without any real basis in reality because the backend of AI market is so uncertain.Unfortunately, the market doesn't really trade around traditional valuation models. The even crazier part is that people think VOO is a smart investment and NVDA isn't when their S&P 500 gains would be almost completely wiped out if NVDA crashed.DCF works in some cases, but in highly speculative cases, how could you trust your numbers. NVDA is supply constrained because there aren't enough high-end fabs in existence to meet demand. NVDA's valuation is dependent on a world-wide ramp-up of capacity.It's a pretty wild case. The prof there sold at 400 because he's a professor, not a trader. Traders will drive this price higher, and unless you avoid major index investment in general, very few investments are insulated from a potential crash in the next Gen semi industry.My point is that both NVDA bulls and bears are talking out their ass whenever they cite some wild speculation on value. NVDA is an edge case that doesn't fit into the box of the dot.com bubble. NVDA sells real products that are very hard to make, not ""clicks."" sorry for the strawman, but it's clear that much of the jitters around this AI runnup stems from dot.com crash ptsd.",5,0.522,NEGATIVE,1.0

And I’ve made a serious amount of money on them.My nvidia is up 39% and 22% today. Just today.Read the earnings. Really read it and not the headlines. I feel like you are a band Wagoneer and I feel like you are chasing winners.Both of those are pretty good ways to lose money. And they’re very superficial ways to engage the stock market. Your pursuit of shit coins means you want to get the 10,000% return that you’re never going to get again. And you’re chasing FOMO fear of missing out coins. But you’re basically just a sucker for any thing big coming along with fancy colors and big promises/lies.So I think you need to change your whole perspective. Whether Nvidia is good or not is kind of irrelevant to why and how you’re pursuing it. You’re making it another shit coin and hoping to get 10,000% return so you can buy a Lamborghini and get a sub forum under Wall Street bets.Sorry if this is coming off as crass, but I feel like you’re doing pure speculation. You’re not investing at all. You don’t know what these coins are, you don’t know what the stock is. You see it rose and now you’re chasing after it.Why do you want to buy it? What do you find compelling about Nvidia? Who is the CEO? I’m betting you don’t know even a handful of details about it. Then you’re looking for our blessing to go blindly gambling.And as much as I like Nvidia, I just don’t want to see people wantonly speculating on stuff. They don’t understand, they see a stampede of feet. You’re just a cow in a herd at that point you don’t even know what you’re running from or running to.Take time to understand investments. Actually read them. Actually understand them! If you wanna speculate and follow the herd, then follow it. You can see it running right now. You don’t need our sensible advice. Just buy more shit coins, buy more flavors of the month, and keep losing money because you can’t spot a scam from a legit company.",0,0.531,NEGATIVE,1.0

Sorry if it sounds that way, not trying to attack you hereI guess I was reading pretty heavily into ""shitcoins"" that you are not really investing so much as looking to trade profitably, and I believe there's a difference. If you believe in tech broadly but want to be ""long term"" investing, as you say, why buy just NVDA? Maybe its cheap, maybe it's just had a decade-worthy run and the party's over.You're looking to diversify, you could look for an index that tracks tech manufacturing more broadly? Your strategies just seem risky and (forgive me) not based on a deep knowledge of the industry/market so much as chasing big returns. Like, if you're such a big believer in NVDA... where were you a couple years ago? It goes up 200% in a year and now you're thinking about selling your internet gambling beans to buy it?

Yes, getting in now is taking a considerable risk. I wouldn't do it, and you shouldn't consider doing it with money you need. But if you've got some mad money, buying Nvidia now could make sense. It's up a seemingly-absurd amount, but it's earnings have been seemingly-absurd. It's got huge momentum, so it could yet keep growing toward the sky. At some point its earnings will disappoint Wall Street and you should expect the stock to crater. But with ultra-growth stocks like this, the news could change again the next quarter and the stock could go higher than it was before the crash.In theory a split should have little effect on the stock's price. In practice, a split in a stock like this tends to drive it higher.Investing in Nvidia now is a little bit more like an investment than a casino gamble, but only a little bit.

My 13 y/o son asked me to inquire about NVDA (rolls eyes), having no background knowledge about investing, I thought it best to review feedback from forums FIRST, then reach out to my employer resource (if needed) for more information. Given what I’m seeing a common thread of, it looks necessary to start at square ONE on investing for beginners, any advice on books, sites, etc to start with? If not NVDA, it’ll more than likely be another investment soon, so I may as well gain knowledge now….",0,0.518,NEGATIVE,0.524
