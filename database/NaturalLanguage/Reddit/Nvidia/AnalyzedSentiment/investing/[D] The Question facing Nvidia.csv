,"The problem this stock faces is no one knows how to value it. The company are investing in technology that opens up new markets (AI, Omniverse and self driving for example). Will those markets pan out or will they go bust? And if they do pan out, what's the value of those markets? Nobody knows, these markets haven't been served before. Today's share price is a reflection of the market sentiment, the voting machine's results as of this moment. The current share price is either grossly over extended or grossly undervalued -- there is no in between in my opinion. I believe Nvidia has cemented itself as the hardware technology leadership company of the era, much like IBM and Intel of past decades. Some on Wall St understand this, others are coming to understand it. But there are many who doubt that is the case as well. The most obvious question from doubters is about competition: Won't AMD or Intel or Google or Apple just come in with better technology and take their position? I've been invested in this company for more than 15 years and what they do uniquely are two things: 1. Strategize and 2. Execute. They have been building a GPGPU platform (General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit), otherwise known as ""accelerated computing"" since about 2007. It's different from standard CPUs in that it processes massive amounts of data in parallel, tens of thousands of ""cores"" operating at the same time. Their platform is a combination of inter-generational compatible hardware and software. The platform is robust, reliable, well supported, offers regular performance improvements, and is now ubiquitous with over 4million developers using it including nearly every AI developer on the planet. So when a competitor comes to throw their hat in the ring, there is an enormous defensive position to overcome that includes a large user base who are getting reliable, quantifiable and predictable results. Since 2014 predictions of Nvidia's demise in the data center have been constant from both mammoth technology companies (AMD, Intel, Google, Baidu) and startups alike. But no one has been able to make a real dent in Nvidia's momentum and share -- not with CPUs, ASICs, FPGAs or any other technology. In their core area of AI model training, Nvidia has between 85-95% market share depending on whose numbers you look at. They are serving this with the largest, most complex mass produced semiconductor devices man can imagine. What about other GPUs? GPUs have proven an excellent solution for the job, they are readily available, flexible and performant. AMD and Intel are building new GPUs and pursuing as "" AI is their number 1 priority."" I expect these companies to pick up some business simply because Nvidia cannot service 100% of the demand they are creating. But these well-regarded companies have a difficult hill to climb in software. They need to make their products work as well as Nvidia's to be competitive, if they don't they will likely sell at a deep discount. A ""real"" competitive offering will have to exceed Nvidia's solution in both performance and ease of use. I haven't seen that sort of competitor surface in the past 10 years, nor can I see one on the horizon. There may be one lurking -- certainly a possibility -- but it will take 2-4 years minimum for that type of solution to come to market. In the mean time, Nvidia is out re-architecting data centers with AI-centric chip solutions: CPUs, GPUs, DPUs and networking and switching technology. They continue to raise the bar for competitors. Soon data center processing will be managed by AI techniques to yield better, faster, more power efficient results sooner. Nvidia owns data center acceleration -- the nexus of AI -- for the near term. Is AI a real technology that has launched and will add value to human kind in innumerable ways, or does it sputter and fizzle into another ""AI winter"" from whence Nvidia becomes a footnote in history? That is the question on this company's share price. FPE, PS, DCF ? These are just irrelevant metrics in this context.","The difference between the entire market and Nvidia is CUDA.

I've been invested in this company for more than 15 years and what they do uniquely are two things: 1. Strategize and 2. Execute. They have been building a GPGPU platform (General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit), otherwise known as ""accelerated computing"" since about 2007. It's different from standard CPUs in that it processes massive amounts of data in parallel, tens of thousands of ""cores"" operating at the same time. Their platform is a combination of inter-generational compatible hardware and software. The platform is robust, reliable, well supported, offers regular performance improvements, and is now ubiquitous with over 4million developers using it including nearly every AI developer on the planet. So when a competitor comes to throw their hat in the ring, there is an enormous defensive position to overcome that includes a large user base who are getting reliable, quantifiable and predictable results. Since 2014 predictions of Nvidia's demise in the data center have been constant from both mammoth technology companies (AMD, Intel, Google, Baidu) and startups alike. But no one has been able to make a real dent in Nvidia's momentum and share -- not with CPUs, ASICs, FPGAs or any other technology. In their core area of AI model training, Nvidia has between 85-95% market share depending on whose numbers you look at. They are serving this with the largest, most complex mass produced semiconductor devices man can imagine. What about other GPUs? GPUs have proven an excellent solution for the job, they are readily available, flexible and performant. AMD and Intel are building new GPUs and pursuing as "" AI is their number 1 priority."" I expect these companies to pick up some business simply because Nvidia cannot service 100% of the demand they are creating. But these well-regarded companies have a difficult hill to climb in software. They need to make their products work as well as Nvidia's to be competitive, if they don't they will likely sell at a deep discount. A ""real"" competitive offering will have to exceed Nvidia's solution in both performance and ease of use. I haven't seen that sort of competitor surface in the past 10 years, nor can I see one on the horizon. There may be one lurking -- certainly a possibility -- but it will take 2-4 years minimum for that type of solution to come to market.

Soon data center processing will be managed by AI techniques to yield better, faster, more power efficient results sooner. Nvidia owns data center acceleration -- the nexus of AI -- for the near term.

Do you think currently Nvidia is overvalued on hype? If not, do you have an opinion on where a good spot for Nvidia to settle is?Also any thoughts on upcoming earnings?

I've been invested in this company for more than 15 years and what they do uniquely are two things: 1. Strategize and 2. Execute. They have been building a GPGPU platform (General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit), otherwise known as ""accelerated computing"" since about 2007. It's different from standard CPUs in that it processes massive amounts of data in parallel, tens of thousands of ""cores"" operating at the same time. Their platform is a combination of inter-generational compatible hardware and software. The platform is robust, reliable, well supported, offers regular performance improvements, and is now ubiquitous with over 4million developers using it including nearly every AI developer on the planet. So when a competitor comes to throw their hat in the ring, there is an enormous defensive position to overcome that includes a large user base who are getting reliable, quantifiable and predictable results. Since 2014 predictions of Nvidia's demise in the data center have been constant from both mammoth technology companies (AMD, Intel, Google, Baidu) and startups alike. But no one has been able to make a real dent in Nvidia's momentum and share -- not with CPUs, ASICs, FPGAs or any other technology. In their core area of AI model training, Nvidia has between 85-95% market share depending on whose numbers you look at. They are serving this with the largest, most complex mass produced semiconductor devices man can imagine. What about other GPUs? GPUs have proven an excellent solution for the job, they are readily available, flexible and performant. AMD and Intel are building new GPUs and pursuing as "" AI is their number 1 priority."" I expect these companies to pick up some business simply because Nvidia cannot service 100% of the demand they are creating. But these well-regarded companies have a difficult hill to climb in software. They need to make their products work as well as Nvidia's to be competitive, if they don't they will likely sell at a deep discount. A ""real"" competitive offering will have to exceed Nvidia's solution in both performance and ease of use. I haven't seen that sort of competitor surface in the past 10 years, nor can I see one on the horizon. There may be one lurking -- certainly a possibility -- but it will take 2-4 years minimum for that type of solution to come to market.

Soon data center processing will be managed by AI techniques to yield better, faster, more power efficient results sooner.

Sometimes the market is over optimistic and sometimes too pessimistic.If the market expects 10, the actual reality turns out to be 20, and you guessed reality would be higher than 10 (expectation) and you bought the stock, the stock revises higher once results come out and you obtain ‘alpha’.I remember back then there were people who thought nvidia was overvalued but the actual growth turned out to be even greater than the market expected.It can work in reverse too.

In their core area of AI model training, Nvidia has between 85-95% market share depending on whose numbers you look at.

I expect these companies to pick up some business simply because Nvidia cannot service 100% of the demand they are creating.
