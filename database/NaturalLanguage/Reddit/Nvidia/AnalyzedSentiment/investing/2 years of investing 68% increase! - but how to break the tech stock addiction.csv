To buy a stock, you have to buy at a price that someone wants to sell, which means you have to buy at a price that's higher than the most recent price. You usually don't notice because big stocks move by less than 1 cent per transaction, but when you buy a stock, you have to buy at a higher price than the current price. Thus the price goes up.If everyone expects a stock to go up, they will all buy, and the price will go up a bunch, and now there's no one left to keep buying, so the price stops going up. When people are the absolute most optimistic about a stock is when they're willing to pay the most, which means the price is the highest it can get—which means the only way it can go is down.(I wouldn't say that's necessarily true of NVDA, because there are still lots of people who haven't bought yet or who might buy more.

So I'll bite and try and give some advice (although I'm a quite bit a bit new to actually investing so take with a grain (or more) of salt).I think your ""safest"" bet would be to diversity into Small Cap ETFs (because anything that's tracking S&P500 or NASDAQ is also going to be NVDA and MSFT) and maybe the energy sector. Power companies because we always need electricity for all this tech we're using. Energy sector because whether you go green or coal - neither is poised to overtake the other any time soon. And while it's not guaranteed, I bet that the bigger companies like Exxon, BP, etc are also diversifying so they don't die when countries start going green for real. (then again, maybe not - look at Kodak inventing digital cameras and then doing nothing with it. Or the Mainframe companies that died when PCs came out)",0,0.529,NEGATIVE,1.0

For example, i have huge positions in Celsius, and did for a while in Target. Also chipotle, cava or some restaurant groups are a good play these day.Bottom line is throw a big portion of cash into an index or etf and don’t worry about it.
