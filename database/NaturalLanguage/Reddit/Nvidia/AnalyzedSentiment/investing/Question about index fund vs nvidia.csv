,Right now I have 7k in a Roth IRA and it’s all in fxaix. I’ve been seeings lots of stuff about nvidia eventually becoming a new apple type company that will be way higher than where it is now. Is it worth taking the risk and buying it with 3k now? I’m worried about missing an opportunity to get a company like this cheaper and getting a great head start in investing.,No,0,0.5,NEGATIVE,0.906

Today it beat earnings and profit. Market reacted negatively and dragged AMD, even Intel down. Rumor that a server uses Nvda chip cooked its books brought stock from 630 to below 300. Any company announced it is buying back stocks often implies they do not have any more tricks to play and have to reduce the stock dilution to bring stock up as it sees. My entry point is $135/s. Most of my hoard already cashed out when the AI news came out. Left with 10s now just 100s (split) for seeded money. I have been buying Nvda and sell them since 2010s. Timing is everything.Most these techs pushed yout FXAIX. W/O AI this year FXAIX increase was worse than gold prices. I see further down we will have glitches esp in an election year. I am all into interest sensitive safe income funds because they already bounced up and for each cut it bounces up more.",0,0.574,NEGATIVE,1.0
