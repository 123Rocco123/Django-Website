Age of account is a biggie but fake accounts are still sold every day. Things like age and activity just up the premium and relative to typical media costs or other ways to influence anyone, still very cheap.Beyond age, look for large time gaps in Post activity in older accounts, super low effort image/link Posts (especially if headline/clickbait in nature), Posts that are duplicated or very similar, very isolated/similar Post topics in only a few subs, or low activity in comments unrelated to their own Posts.Not an exact science but all are yellow flags and they are just examples. Imo, the prevalence of disengenuous accounts (beyond bots) is far greater than anyone in the media admits or that is ever going to be researched without bias, since wealth/power/agendas/institutions have the greatest ability to use these tactics.Its also why you will never see a politician last long making an argument for legislation of free speech to be changed to include social media (SM), yet no one sane or reasonable denies SM platforms are currently one of the largest tools (if not the largest) capable of influencing society.",1,0.512,1.0,NEGATIVE

I was desperately searching for a forum that wasn’t all the sky is falling or HODL or some penny stock pump and dump.I was on investing forum decades ago and almost immediately they got taken over by people with stock positions. Actively trying to defend them. And it just wasn’t real adviceThen I noticed there were no posting requirements in this forum. So I wrote the mods and said I think you should have a one year minimum on allowing people to post. It’s too easy for people to come here and try and influence trades. And that can wreck a forum.They said they were aware of it and they can keep up with it. And I haven’t seen all that much of it. Fake accounts that is.But if you type “China is a third world power and no one should invest in them and their dictator looks like Winnie the Pooh.” You will get bot account responses.

Any example that relates to societal trends, entertainement, or even agendas, etc., it can benefit echo chambers who do not want criticism being introduced (and I have seen it used this way quite a bit).For market subs...I find it more practical but its also a fine line and just depends on who can abuse it. Its like tax law, if you have the resources you will adapt.Edit: Your last bit tho...is my biggest problem with all of SM...and how much I 100% believe most just have no idea of its prevalence. Its also specifically concerning with how Reddit in particular works as they move toward IPO and potentially gain more influence without acknowledgement of how censorship can be abused vs perpetuation that its only a positive that subs choose rules/mods.If corps/agendas/institutions can essentially run marketing strategies through subs disengenuously without any law or regulation...its a dangerous path.Edit 2: Simply a bravo call out that you also test functionality on SM lol. I do too. Hell, I tested out the free Chat GPT version almost a yr ago and was quite disappointed once you get past the novelty. Its capability to give non-biased or details for valid responses of anything subjective at all may as well been the the same as asking an avg redditor who gives headline responses from a quick google search, the AI was just faster.",3,0.519,0.998,NEGATIVE
