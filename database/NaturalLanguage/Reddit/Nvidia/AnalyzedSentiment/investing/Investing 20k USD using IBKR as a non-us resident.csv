,I am from Pakistan and just signed up on IBKR. I have $20k USD sitting in my Wise account that gives me nothing. Its like 15% of total net worth. I don't have debt at all. All my monthly expenses are covered easily by my job. So these funds are just sitting idle. I have tried crypto but lost like $2k in futures trading. I want to grow my savings gradually. Should I DCA into VOO $1k/month? Should I DCA like $100/month or $200/month into TESLA NVIDIA or any other IT company. I know they are part of VOO but investing individually can give higher returns if DCA works perfectly.,"If you’re looking to hold long term drop it all in to something like VOO at once. Timing the market is hard and over time it’s only going to go up. If you’re looking for a more short term play, you can try to time some smaller individual stocks and sell them on the upswing. If you have a higher risk tolerance and time to hold investing it in a single stock with higher potential is better than something like VOO.I think Nvidia can still 3x over the next 5ish years. You won’t see that kind of gains in VOO but depending on a multitude of factors it could just as easily stagnate whereas VOO is practically guaranteed to see consistent gains.If you’re going to do anything besides dump it all in something like VOO or SPY and hold it for years to come I wouldn’t listen to anyone’s advice on smaller stocks on reddit and do your own research.",0,0.53,1.0,NEGATIVE

If yes, do not buy US domiciled ETFs or individual stocks. While you're okay for now but if your portfolio grows over 60k usd, you'd be subject US estate tax if the unthinkable happens. Moreover, you will pay 30% withholding tax on dividends unless your country of residence has a tax treaty with the US which i don't think Pakistan does.You could buy the same or very similar Irish domiciled ETFs to shield you from a possible estate tax and pay only 15% withholding tax on dividends.As an example VUSA is the Irish domiciled version of VOO. Both are vanguard and both track the S&P 500 (i.e. returns are near identical pre TER and withholding tax). The expense ratio of Irish domiciled etfs tends to be higher than the US domiciled version but you'd be saving that on the withholding tax reduction alone. Plus not having to pay US estate tax in itself should be enough of a reason to avoid VOO as non US resident.Also, look at vwra or other global etfs. Going all in on the s&p500 might continue to give superior returns(it has been for the last couple of decades) in the future but maybe it won't. I personally invest in vwra (60% usa, 40% ex-usa) and believe that diversifying outside of the US is a better strategy.",0,0.524,1.0,NEGATIVE

Vusa is still the s&p500.And no, i would imagine you still have to pay the any taxes on capital gains levied by the government of pak. I have actually been living outside pak for the last 5 years so not sure how local taxation would work but with irish domiciled stocks you pay a little less of the withholding tax that the US govt would have charged you.Also, can you open an ibkr account in pak? I didn't think you could.",2,0.522,1.0,NEGATIVE

As explained here, the Irish domiciled ETFs pay 15% withholding tax of the dividends instead of 30% for VOO, SPY and all US domiciled ETFs.",1,0.528,0.991,NEGATIVE
