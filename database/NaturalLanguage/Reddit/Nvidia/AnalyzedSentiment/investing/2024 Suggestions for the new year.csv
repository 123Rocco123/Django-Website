,"2023 was a good year, ~40% up for the year. My portfolio looks like this: 50% S&P ETF and a couple of Vanguard ETFs (super happy with this) 50% various stocks. Many of the stocks I have trimmed to about half if they are at their 52 week high, or just crazy high, like NVIDIA, taking the profits so I don't ride them back down. Any thoughts on Mid and Large-cap stocks with good growth that are 'at or lower' than the midpoint of their 52-week range? Dividends are a plus.

They cater to diverse demographics and relationship goals, generating revenue through user subscriptions and advertising.Strengths:Dominant Market Share: MTCH holds a large share of the global online dating market, particularly in the U.S. Their flagship app, Tinder, enjoys widespread recognition and user base.Portfolio Diversification: They own a variety of brands across different price points and niche audiences, mitigating risks associated with any single platform.Growth Potential: The online dating market is expected to continue expanding, providing opportunities for Match Group to acquire new users and increase revenue.Strong Financials: The company possesses a solid financial position with consistent revenue growth, profitability, and free cash flow.Weaknesses:Reliance on Tinder: While diversified, Tinder remains the primary source of revenue and user growth, making the company vulnerable to any significant issues or changes in its popularity.Competition: The online dating market is competitive, with new apps and features constantly emerging, potentially challenging Match Group's market share.Regulation: Regulatory scrutiny and potential data privacy concerns could impact the company's operations and user base.Valuation: While financially strong, some analysts consider MTCH slightly overvalued compared to its growth prospects.Financial Analysis:Market Capitalization: $19.26 billion (as of December 30, 2023)Revenue: $3.13 billion in 2022, expected to grow at 5.4% in 2023 and 8% in 2024 (estimated)Earnings per Share (EPS): $1.57 in 2022, expected to increase to $2.78 in 2023 and $3.16 in 2024 (estimated)PE Ratio: 10.7 in 2023 (based on estimated EPS)Dividend Yield: 1.4%Future Outlook:Match Group remains a major player in the online dating market with strong prospects for growth. However, maintaining momentum requires navigating competition, diversifying successfully, and adapting to regulatory changes and evolving user preferences.Potential Investment Considerations:Investors seeking exposure to the growing online dating market may find MTCH attractive.Diversified investors could consider MTCH for its established portfolio and financial stability.Value investors might wait for a potential price correction if they consider MTCH slightly overvalued.Remember: This analysis is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

Thankfully much of those proceeds bought ~450 shares of AMD so I didn't really suffer but not betting against that beast again anytime soon and held a decent amount still. $1000+ stock price within the next few years if not sooner the way I see. Believe it or not despite all metrics it's still undervalued. Haven't sold either since. The party is just getting startedhttp://stocktwits.com/mikel3113/message/71190466",0,0.536,0.981,NEGATIVE
