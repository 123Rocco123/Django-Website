,"Hi guys, I received some shares from my dad which are in the second biggest German bank, Commerzbank. They're a lot, like 775 piece, but the price has fallen from like a high of 200 before the financial crisis to 2008 to a meager 10 euro per share. And the last few years, it has barely moved, performing atrociously. On the other hand, I bought some stocks in Apple, Nvidia, Tesla and they've performed quite well, e.g. Nvidia is up 100%, but I only own a bit, like 20-30 shares. However, both investments are worth around 8000 dollars lol, and I thought about liquidating one position because I need cash at the moment. Would you sell option A (huge amounts of Commerzbank shares) or option B (low volume of high-growth stocks) if you needed the money today? And if so, why?","The number of shares is irrelevant, really, it’s just the total value of the position that matters. So if you feel the bank stock is a dead end and will be for the foreseeable future I’d nuke that position instead of the positions you’re more optimistic about.",0,0.538,0.99,NEGATIVE

What you should be thinking about is if you’d hold the same stocks if they weren’t a gift.,0,0.516,0.99,NEGATIVE

And if so, why?",For day trading volume is everything because of larger B/A variance. For long term it could be high quality stocks. Hope that helps.,0,0.541,0.982,NEGATIVE
