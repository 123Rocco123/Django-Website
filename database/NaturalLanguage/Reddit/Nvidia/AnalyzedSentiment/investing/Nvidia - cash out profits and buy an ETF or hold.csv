,"Nvidia releases earnings on 2/21. There doesn't seem to be a consensus what the stock will do, especially given the fact that the price doesn't really seem to be tied to traditional valuations. I currently have over 300 shares, mostly long-term with a gain of almost 700%. I'm 52 and looking to retire in about 8 years, with an overall net worth (including house) of over $2.5M. Most of my net worth is in a 401k, but I have a significant amount tied up in stocks, with Nvidia now representing over 30% of my total stock holdings (not including 401k). I've been considering cashing out a chunk of Nvidia and just putting it in an ETF like VOO to insulate me a bit from any potential massive down-tick in the stock. Unfortunately, most of the ETFs are also heavily invested in the ""Magnificent 7"" stocks, which includes Nvidia. I've also been trying to figure out what a good ""break-even"" type point would be, if I cashed out and took a 20% capital gains hit (federal + state) and how much the stock would need to drop for me to buy back in at a more reasonable price. I'm clearly a bit all over the map here and would appreciate some feedback and guidance.","NVDA is a great company and a stock I plan to hold forever.However, if I had 300 shares I would likely be selling some into this mania, and certainly prior to earnings. Having 30% of your holdings in a single stock, even the market leader, is a big risk.Since your gain is 700% you can sell half and still be way ahead. That would be my plan. If the stock surges to 1000 on earnings you're still holding a big chunk.",0,0.579,0.99,NEGATIVE

Then reinvest it in an ETF. If you go with an ETF like VOO that money you reinvest will still have some exposure to NVDA while being diversified. At 52 with ~8 years till retirement, mitigating risk is a smart move, and it may be more prudent to diversify more than just VOO (I'll leave it at that because I haven't looked at ideal portfolio balance <10 years till retirement).I on the other hand have 8 shares of NVDA, while at a similar 700% gain, I'm going to hold onto those shares for the next decade and see where it goes. I'm also 32 and have a lot of years to go until retirement.",1,0.534,0.98,NEGATIVE

If I'm saving up for a big purchase (house, car, etc) I'm going to take some profits.Always some exceptions here or there depending on the company and price situation, like just sold off ~ 1/3 of my MSTR holdings to lock in some profits for now, but that's a very volatile stock and I think BTC will dip either leading up to or around the halving, before price starts going back up a few months after.

I suspect either NVDA has this worked out and is about to take over the world in a way we have never seen before, or they will pull back and go strong again later on when they are closer to actually delivering general AI.
