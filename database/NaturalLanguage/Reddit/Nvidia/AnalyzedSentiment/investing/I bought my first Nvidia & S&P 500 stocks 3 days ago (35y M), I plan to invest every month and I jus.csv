,"Basically I have 5k saved for investing next month, but I have a feeling SOUN might be a good opportunity to invest right now. Since i have 0 experience with stock trends, how likely, based on someone's rich experience (or richer than mine at least) SOUN stocks should keep growing before end of the year?","I know nothing about SOUN other than being up 61% last week and 163% last month.Generally you want to buy low and sell high, not buy high and sell higher.

Financial analysis, look at margins, past and present and how they have grown/shrunk over time, and why (is the margin growth sustainable? Did it shrink from a one time expense? Etc.) and compare to competitors and industry. Look at ROA, ROE, debt levels, interest coverage, etc. and compare to industry and competitors. Still look good? Continue.4. Value, how much is the company worth right now. There’s many different ways:Comparison; most direct competitor “A” has a PE of 19, my company has a PE of 34, potentially overvalued. Look at other comparisons as well.Discounted Cash Flow: project future cash flows and discount them to present value.Dividend Discount: discount future dividends to present value.All of those are very simplified, and there are other ways to value the company.5. If the current value is higher than current price, it’s overvalued (don’t buy) if it’s below it’s undervalued (buy).",4,0.563,NEGATIVE,0.971
