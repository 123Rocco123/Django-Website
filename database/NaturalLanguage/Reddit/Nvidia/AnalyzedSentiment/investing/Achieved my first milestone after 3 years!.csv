,"After 3 years of investing, I've finally achieved my goal of investing my first $100,000! This was a challenge I gave myself after hearing Warren Buffet say you should strive to invest 100k into the market. (I know that by now it's inflated to likely be the equivalent of 300k, but that's my next goal.) I did this by living with my parents and paying low but fair rent, finding a decent job that pays 75k-80k a year, avoiding fast food where possible, and just being frugal in general. Investment strategy: investing $10 every business day into both VOO and VOOG. (roughly $400 a month) investing in Tesla when Tesla is low. (this is 20% of my portfolio. My largest position.) keeping my ear to the ground, and capitalizing on things like meta's stock devaluing. (Though, I totally missed Nvidia sadly.) diversifying into other promising tech companies, such as Microsoft and Google. (less than fruitful, but it's still diversified.) I think the riskiest strategy has been in Tesla. In the past, it's been difficult watching the stock go up and down, but I had faith in their business practices and ethics. Now Tesla is popping off, and given Elon's position with Trump, this should give room for Tesla to continue its growth. Sadly, because of that, I can't view Tesla as much as an ethical company as much as I could in the past, but that won't diminish it's ability to grow and I see the stock continuing to rise in the future. Looking forward: Since Tesla isn't going to be low for some time, one thing I want to invest in going forward is in clean power companies, such as nuclear for AI companies. So I'll continue looking into that for future paychecks to go to. Any recommendations are welcome! My next goal will be to reach $300,000 invested by the end of 2026. What do you all think? Achievable?","Congratulations, my friend. :-) It is said that the first $100K is the hardest, and then it gets progressively easier at the each $100K milestone. Keep up the good work.",0,0.569,POSITIVE,0.991

You just need to keep piling in the investment funds and one day the market will take off and you'll make an entire year's income in just a week. Or a day lol",0,0.552,POSITIVE,0.982
