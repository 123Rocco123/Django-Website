,https://imgur.com/a/xeXhUC I wonder what does analysts do to forecast the target price and how to know if they are trustworthy. Anyone take analyst’s forecast very seriously and actually invest based on that? Looks like analysts and morningstar research come up with different conclusions on Nvidia.   ,"I worked at a high level in equity research for a top tier investment bank. To forecast target prices we build financial models and would use DCF and other methods. A target price is basically a valuation.We had access to data from analysts covering similar stocks and very good access company management. I could often just call the CFO of big firms.My clients were giant global institutional investors or fund managers. Frequently they would have much more experience than we did and might even know the companies better. I had clients who had done my job and covered the same companies ten years ago and has been investing large amounts in them since that time.However, it is important to realize that both research and my own experience shows that the price target is actually among the least valued part of reports for institutional investors. The most valued in my opinion is the ability to spend a lot of time to understand dynamics in the industry and the company’s position within that as well as access to management that allowed me to ask questions directly and privately.It is natural and health for different analysts or brokers to have different opinions. The share price of a listed company is very close to being an example of an efficient market entity. Basically half the market thinks it is undervalued and half think it is overvalued.Good institutional investors often want to see both arguments- for and against and can use that to make the best decision.I always believed that my role as a analyst was to help clients make the best investment decisions, not to make those decisions myself. I have sort of said to analysts who worked for me that if all of our competitors have a “Buy” on a stock and they want to get attention maybe they need to consider a “Sell”. The market needs both.A good investor will be happy to see a buy and a sell rating on a stick they are interested in. They presumably already have a view on the company and industry. So reading the positive and negative cases back-to-back enables them to make decisions.But only institutional investors had access to the research and they paid a lot for it. But the very top clients paid more and go more access. The very top could call and talk to me it an analyst whenever they wanted.But at the end of the day a few random price targets by themselves are useless.",0,0.544,NEGATIVE,0.934
