As the years pass like 30 years nvidia will be an absolute powerhouse. I can even see google/youtube taking over the movie industry and sports streaming.","Well, every intelligent person should logically prefer pc over consoles. I want console by myself but for me is console always secondary, not important or needy, as for most people at least I hope.So yeah I think you are right, there are also a lot of people whom are not educated in world of technology. Personally, I think the most of those people are 40+ though.The only thing that depends on whether or not nvidia will have potential huge growth still in the future is whether nvidia starts paying dividends or not. (For me 0.02% div. yield is not worth to call real dividend stock)",0,0.538,NEGATIVE,0.907
,"Why nvidia has so much more room to grow. I’m 32 y/o, started playing pc when I was 20. Games like RuneScape blabla cause that’s all that computers could handle and had for games back then.

For example nvidia is still growing, has reached $1200 price per share last week and has div. yield just 0.02%. Meta almost performed the same way in last year, has $500 price per share and has 0.4% div. yield which is cca 20 times more than nvidia.",2,0.602,NEGATIVE,0.997
