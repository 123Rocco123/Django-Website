Any to recommend apart from the obvious like Nvidia, Meta..?",True but that’s more of a long term investment 5-10 years if not more.

I want to take out some of this invest it into other AI related stocks. Any to recommend apart from the obvious like Nvidia, Meta..?",Nothing in particular. I like midstream companies because they do well in almost any market. I was pretty invested in EPD but have since moved to MLPA. I don't expect a lot of growth in the stocks. I do see them going up a bit. But the distributions are what I go for. I like the quarterly distributions. Many of these pay themselves back in about 10 to 15 years. It's not for everyone.,2,0.535,NEGATIVE,0.618

Any to recommend apart from the obvious like Nvidia, Meta..?","We are in the early innings of AI with hardware leading.For me, the hardware will become commoditized but the question is when - I personally suspect in ~ 5 years.In my opinion, the generational winners will be companies with the largest datasets will prevail - GOOG=BIDU > APPL> AMZN=BABA > MSFT=META but there will also be industry specific players (like healthcare, i.e., drug discovery , possibly UNH or research hospital like MSK or Duke Univ), defense maybe PLTR, travel = BKNG, retail (specifically grocery) - any large chains with loyalty programs (they know a lot about you and your preference) or TSLA has more driving data, particularly for autonomous driving AI.I would also not rule out Bloomberg as they have immense financial data sets and how companies interrelate. I suspect they are already using it and being private do not publicize it.MSFT except for OFFICE has been a follower or acquirer; they were way behind on AI and is the reason they partnered with OpenAI and did better PR.I personally am sticking with Google and META as they already have large datasets on consumer personal preferences and searches.I also suspect that APPL (I know they partner with OpenAI for the consumer front, but believe they have internal products) and AMZN have better AI tech as it is captive and will never be in the open market for competitive reasons.There was a good new release of data is king and those that can exploit data will win. Isomorphic Labs partnering with LLY and NVS on drug discovery. If you can shorten drug discovery time and extend protection - it is a big win.Here is an old post that may help with a visual presentation some potential players.",0,0.532,NEGATIVE,0.998
